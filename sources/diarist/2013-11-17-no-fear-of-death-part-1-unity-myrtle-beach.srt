1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,680
Margaret Hiller: Okay, okay,
Alrighty, welcome, welcome,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,920
welcome, and for those of you
who don't know me, I'm Margaret

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,860
Hill around spiritual leader
here at Unity Christ Church.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,940
Thank you. Be guided to here. We
are so welcome to unity, and we

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,700
are so happy and grateful that
Chris Bache has returned to

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,160
visit with us. I know it's not
just because Ann Marie, our

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,600
member and bookstore manager,
happens to be his mother in law.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,520
We know he's here because He
loves us. And actually, I have

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,320
it on good authority from Chris
that he really does appreciate

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:48,520
this group. And so Chris, wow.
He comes to us with over 30

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,960
years of being a professor in
luminous studies and also a

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,680
former Director of Education at
Institute of Noetic Sciences.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,720
He's written several books, and
most importantly, he's been here

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,420
before, and we all so respect
and honor you and your

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,060
presentation style and presence
and all that you bring to us. So

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,700
thank you for being here again.
Chris fish, thank you. Good

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,060
morning,

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,080
Chris Bache: everybody. Morning.
Everybody. How nice to be back

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,680
with you again.

20
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,740
Margaret Hiller: Now, let me
just ask Ross about, do we need

21
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,660
a mic? Because we can, like,
Yeah,

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,140
Chris Bache: good question. Do
we? Are we? Okay, noise wise,

23
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,460
how we doing? Everybody able to
hear? Don't be shy about that's

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,340
a good voice. Anything lower
than that, anything more

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,860
Margaret Hiller: than I can get
the mic, and that may help.

26
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,760
Okay, okay,

27
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,600
Chris Bache: I'd love to talk
about the things we're going to

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,900
talk about today, and I just got
oodles of information to share

29
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,020
with you, but the most important
thing I'm going to be trying to

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,400
do is interest you in reading
some of these books, some of

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,420
them you will already have read.
Some of them will be new to you,

32
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,520
but the richness is actually
going into the material and

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
reading it yourself firsthand,
because I'm just going to be

34
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,960
summarizing the categories and
touching on some of the things

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,520
that I won't be able to take you
to the richness of it, which is

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,100
really people's lives,
experiences, the actual

37
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,420
experiences. I teach at a state
university in Ohio, and you

38
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,720
know, the religion of the
university today is a secular

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,280
university. Today is secular
humanism. It's material

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,500
reductionism, it's flatland or
metaphysics, where the

41
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,440
conviction is that the physical
world is the only world that's

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,260
real, and anything, any talk of
a world behind the physical

43
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,360
world is just fanciful
speculation. But even in a more

44
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,240
progressive environment, there
is still this, this perception

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,720
that my students come in with
all the time, when we start to

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
look at this information, that
we really can't know what

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,860
happens to us when we die. We
can speculate it, think about

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,500
it. We can have theories about
it, and some of them are

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,200
suggestive, but we really can't
know what happens to us when we

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,520
die? That's beyond the pale of
knowledge. And I think up until

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,900
about 30 years ago, that was
probably true. That probably was

52
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,900
the case, maybe in Western
culture. But I don't think it's

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,900
true today. Today, I think we
have the emergence of

54
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,160
disciplines, new disciplines
that have sufficient momentum

55
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,500
behind them and a convergence of
their data that is really taking

56
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,940
the question of what happens to
us when we die and placing it in

57
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,080
a new context, an empirical
context, and We really are

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,860
beginning to get sustained
insight.

59
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,639
Unknown: Okay, all right, go
ahead and start talking.

60
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,220
Chris Bache: We all you haven't
worked the volume, sustained

61
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,660
insight into the

62
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,839
larger cycle of life, the larger
cycle of life, the larger

63
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,519
patterns of life, only part of
which is what happens to us when

64
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,759
we die. It's not just what
happens to us when we die, it's

65
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,719
what it's that cycle of life
where we keep coming back and

66
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:33,499
we're going to go into where we
go when we die, and where we're

67
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:38,119
coming from when we're born, and
what the larger pattern is. So

68
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:42,279
today is just a sort of a an
introduction to four areas of

69
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,239
research, which, if you the more
you read in this material, the

70
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:51,639
more it just your any residual
fear of death just evaporates.

71
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,759
And I've been watching students
taking them into this material

72
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,259
for decades, and I've watched
their lives be changed because

73
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,579
they be the more. More they
understand, the less they fear,

74
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,279
and then more they can
consciously participate in the

75
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,899
life process, rather than
feeling like a victim or feeling

76
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,559
like we really just don't know.
We're just kind of hopelessly

77
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:18,119
trapped in our ignorance here.
So the areas we're going to look

78
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:22,999
at today four areas of research,
each one of which is a whole

79
00:05:22,999 --> 00:05:24,559
course unto itself.

80
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,720
Four Areas reincarnation
research topic I talked about

81
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,620
when I was here

82
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,700
Margaret Hiller: last time. Oh
Chris, hold it up next there. We

83
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:49,420
go.

84
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,459
Unknown: Figure out for the
library, why

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,680
Chris Bache: near death episode.
Research, people nearly die, or

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,220
they die and they come back life
between life therapy, which is a

87
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,120
sort of a subdivision of past
lives therapy, and it's very

88
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,900
specific kind of track within
the past lives therapy,

89
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,460
tradition and psychedelic
research, the research which our

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,740
government has made illegal in
1969 but before they did that,

91
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,460
it had about 1500 years of
history among Native American

92
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,880
traditions, among Brazilian
traditions. So there is a there

93
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,800
is a massive amount of data that
the anthropologists are

94
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,880
cultivating, and now psychedelic
research is starting, is

95
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,180
resuming again. There's a whole
new generation of young scholars

96
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,200
that are beginning, a whole new
wave of psychedelic research

97
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,480
now, each of these areas
contributes a certain piece to

98
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,320
the discussion. I think you'll
see that there's an overlap in

99
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,820
the material, but each of them
bring out a certain set of

100
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,800
concepts, which puts new pieces
of the puzzle on the table in

101
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,780
reincarnation research. Here,
the concept is the larger cycle

102
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,440
of life. It's it's not just that
we come back, but it is the

103
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,760
larger vision of the soul that
is implicit in the vision of

104
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:33,740
reincarnation. It really has to
do with how old are we and what

105
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,480
kind of time frame are we
looking at to understand life.

106
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,640
It's really a matter of the
fundamental understanding of how

107
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,220
life works at the nuts and bolts
level, in the second category,

108
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,120
the Near-Death Experience
category. Well, there's a lot to

109
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,900
learn here, but the main thing
first we're looking at is what's

110
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,840
it actually like to die from we
know what it's like from the

111
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,500
physical side. You know what
that exit looks like, but what's

112
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,100
it like in the interior side?
What is the experience of life

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,900
like? Of the experience of death
like? Because if reincarnation

114
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,320
is true, then there's a
revolving door, there's a birth

115
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,080
is the entrance, death is the
exit. But what's it really like

116
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,740
to die? And at least we get some
insight by looking at people who

117
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,020
have gotten closer than you and
I have, and then who have been

118
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,940
pulled back by technology and
sampling their experience. And

119
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,080
we're looking at now millions
and millions of human beings who

120
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,180
have had these experiences, and
we've been looking at them now

121
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,500
for 30 years, 35 years, and so
we're getting a lot of good

122
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,780
empirical studies with them in
the life between life therapy.

123
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,660
Here I say we're looking at the
community of heaven. Here we're

124
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,360
getting some insights into the
actual structure of the social

125
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,320
world that we enter when we what
are we doing in between death

126
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,340
and birth? How are we spending
our time? Who are we spending it

127
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,380
with? What's the structure of
reality that we enter? And we're

128
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,100
going to see Michael Newton's
work in life between life

129
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,140
therapy is giving us insights
into this reality, and it turns

130
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,040
out those insights are very
congruent with the insights of

131
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,100
our mystical traditions and deep
spiritual traditions, the

132
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,040
Tibetan embargo, the Book of the
Dead, and the studies of the

133
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,320
Bardo. There's actually a
convergence here between ancient

134
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,520
and modern. And lastly,
psychedelic research. We're

135
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,540
looking at Sacred medicine,
journey, work, sacred medicines

136
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,240
with cultures much wiser than
ours have long known that there

137
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,540
are certain substances, certain
chemicals, which are. Sacred.

138
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,620
They actually. They amplify
consciousness, they expand

139
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,160
consciousness. They give us the
opportunity to enter into a

140
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,800
conscious communion with the
larger world. And these go back

141
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,780
1000s of years, and this is a
lineage which is very important

142
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,880
to me, because my whole
professional life has been spent

143
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,100
really exploring this particular
territory. Even given the

144
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,580
legality in the legal issues,
makes it kind of complicated,

145
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,860
but it allows, it allows us to
push the philosophical questions

146
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,740
into new territory. And I think
you'll see that there is a

147
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,820
positive correlation between
what we're learning from the

148
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,240
sacred medicine work and what
we're learning from these other

149
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,980
non psychedelic areas of
investigation. So the primary

150
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,940
thing I'm going to be doing
today is going to be taking you

151
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,980
into a recommending for your
consideration 12 books. I've

152
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,100
tried. I've asked myself, What
are the three most important

153
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,600
books, the books that would be
the most enlightening for you to

154
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
read in each of these four
categories, and I've thrown in a

155
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
couple more around the edges,
just because I couldn't stand

156
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,040
it. I've tried to boil it down
to three books, which you can

157
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,940
pick up and work your way
through and understand them and

158
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,760
go into the material. So I'm
going to lab here. I'm supposed

159
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,540
to tell you the schedule. We're
going to go until about about an

160
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,660
hour from now, about 1115 take a
short break, 10 minute break,

161
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,360
we'll come back, we'll work
until about 1230 take lunch, and

162
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,920
then we'll not let lunch run too
long, and then we'll come back

163
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,460
and run the afternoon until
three o'clock. Okay? And if you

164
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,420
need to step out for the
bathroom all the way, just step

165
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:05,100
up. And I get excited. So if I
get overtime and I lose track of

166
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,120
time, someone in the time
binder, raise your hand. Let me

167
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,300
know where we are, and questions
are appropriate all the time,

168
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,080
anytime along the way, interrupt
me, because that's when it gets

169
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:28,220
the best. Okay? Ready to go?
Okay, we'll begin with

170
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,740
reincarnation research. Now, the
first two books I'm going to

171
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,980
tell you are not part of the
three, but I couldn't resist not

172
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:47,980
putting the first two is this
book by Ian Stevenson, who just

173
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,740
died recently, so he's watching
from the bleacher seats now.

174
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,680
Margaret Hiller: And Chris, I
understand you have the book

175
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,180
list for us as a handout this
okay,

176
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,400
Chris Bache: just going to make
your work easier. I don't want

177
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,780
to write down so much. Every
good book I mentioned today is

178
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,040
on this list, and so you can
just check off the ones you want

179
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,800
to read and bring the list. She
can order them for you, and some

180
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,500
of them we have in our books
tour already. Ian Stevenson,

181
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,680
university Virginia has
published over a dozen books on

182
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,820
reincarnation research, and he
specializes in studying small

183
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,120
children two to three years old,
who have spontaneous memories of

184
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,760
what appeared to be a former
life, and, of course,

185
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,540
documenting those memories,
verifying those memories,

186
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,380
excluding the situations where
the children might have learned

187
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,040
that information through natural
means, not through actual memory

188
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,160
of a previous existence. All
those things are where the

189
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,040
research comes in. But Stevenson
is a meticulous researcher, he

190
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,060
has documented hundreds of cases
of children from around the

191
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,780
world who, just when they start
to speak when they're two, three

192
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,220
years old, they just matter of
factly bring up their former

193
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,220
life and, you know, unfinished
business, people, they remember,

194
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,960
people they want to talk to. And
we can, we've gotten these

195
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,180
children back into the family of
the original personality, and

196
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,080
they can identify people, they
can name names, they can they

197
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,620
can recall details of family
history. There's infinite

198
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,700
details of the houses they live
in, of things that happen on a

199
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,680
particular event. It's just
extra ordinarily important body

200
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,420
of knowledge. And Stevenson, I
think, is the Charles Darwin of

201
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,860
reincarnation theory, really, as
reincarnation is an old idea,

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,180
like re evolution is an old
idea, but Darwin gave us

203
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,380
empirical facts to assess that
idea, and Stevenson has given us

204
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,320
empirical. Facts to look at
reincarnation. Yes, just how did

205
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,920
Unknown: he get into that? How
did he get

206
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,320
Chris Bache: started? You know,
he was a traditional academic at

207
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,220
University of Virginia. He's in
the medical school there. He

208
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,820
wrote a personality textbook. He
was very traditional stuff. And

209
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,840
then he started encountering
some of these cases. And he had,

210
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,740
I think he had, he's in the
hands and endowed chair head, an

211
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,600
endowed chair. And I think it's
Xerox money or coke money was

212
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,340
behind the chair. And he just,
he put his whole reputation

213
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,840
online. Just found this
fascinating subject. He

214
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,460
recognized that, you know, this
is true, that's just incredibly

215
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,780
important for us. And he just,
he just dug in. He started doing

216
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,220
his international travels.

217
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Audience 2: And there was a
psychiatrist, I forget his name,

218
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,800
he's quite big. He's on Oprah a
few weeks ago, and he talked

219
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,340
about how he was treating
somebody, and she started to

220
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,740
tell the story of her past life,
and then he got into that.

221
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,260
Chris Bache: Brian Weiss, maybe,
yeah. Brian Weiss, yeah. He's

222
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,600
one of the therapists. Now he is
not a therapist. I'm going to

223
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,140
show you a therapist in just a
minute, but he Ian Stevenson, is

224
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,820
not a therapist. He considers
himself a researcher. He's a

225
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,720
psychiatrist. Actually, he
doesn't do therapy, and he

226
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,880
doesn't trust hypnosis as a
source of data. He only wants to

227
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,720
work with people who have
spontaneous memories of what

228
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:43,900
appear to be a former life.
Okay, a therapist and a woman

229
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,240
who I think is one of the great
danes she also is now beside

230
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,420
Stevenson on the bleacher seat.
She just died a few years ago,

231
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,880
Winifred Lucas, and among the
people like Ryan Weiss and other

232
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,760
past lives therapists who were
on the talk show circuit. They

233
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,640
probably were trained by
Winifred Lucas at some time in

234
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,240
their past. She is one of the
older generation. Got into this

235
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,640
work, very, very early, German
educated. She published a two

236
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,660
volume book regression therapy,
which is just they wanted to

237
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:26,540
take past lives therapy and
establish a clinical protocol

238
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,480
for training past lives
therapists. They wanted to

239
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,040
standardize the discipline. And
this two volume book is written.

240
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,060
It's, it's an anthology, two
anthologies. It's the who's who

241
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,020
of people doing past lives
therapy up to the time when it

242
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,760
was published in the mid 1990s
and it's just a wonderful

243
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,760
textbook. Now, both of these
books, they're aimed for

244
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,300
professionals. I mean, they're
really kind of aimed. They're

245
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,120
not easy reading. They're not
for popular press. They were

246
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,440
never intended for the popular
press. They're very manageable.

247
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,180
Stevenson is a bit of a bore to
read. When I've taken my

248
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,900
students into his books, they
say, I'm really glad I read it.

249
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,520
I'm never going to read it
again, because he thinks like a

250
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,360
lawyer. He writes like a lawyer,
but that's exactly the scientist

251
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,440
you want doing this type of work
between the two of them is just

252
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,100
extra ordinarily. It moves the
whole discussion of

253
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,680
reincarnation onto a much larger
landscape in every one of these

254
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,460
cases where people have spoken
the past life, what happened

255
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,500
with them that they can identify
with that and say, that was my

256
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,540
life that's I've often wondered
about that. Or are they picking

257
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,700
up something like Ireland to the
Akashic field, all that energy

258
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,360
that's always out there? Are
people tapping into that? Or is

259
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,080
it actually a form of
reincarnation? You know, some of

260
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,960
you know the work of urban
Laszlo and urban at one point,

261
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,840
came up with it because he was
working on the Akashic field and

262
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,340
really trying to establish a
dialog between quantum theory

263
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,880
and field theory and ancient
theory the Akashic field, the

264
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
mind of the, you know, the
memory of the human species. And

265
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,920
he proposed that what people
were doing when they tapped into

266
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,220
what appeared to be a former
life, they were actually tapping

267
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,480
into the Akashic field that they
weren't really remembering their

268
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,840
life. They were remembering
somebody's life because they

269
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,560
were tapping into the collective
psyche. And he published this at

270
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,920
the end of one of his books, and
I immediately jumped up and

271
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,280
said, No, no, urban, you're
wrong. And so he and I got the

272
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,200
conversation, and he said, write
it up. And so I wrote it up. And

273
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,520
so he published it. And there's
a dialog between urban and I,

274
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,920
and I argued that that's an
inadequate description of the.

275
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,880
Actual fact, when you get into
the cases, it's a nice theory,

276
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,900
but when you get into the cases,
the detail and precision and the

277
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,440
continuity of memory is specific
enough that I think it explains

278
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,340
more to hypothesize if there is
a continuity of individual

279
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,800
memory, rather than hypothesize
that we are tapping into some

280
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,580
impersonal, collective memory,
and I give all the reasons and

281
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,220
whatnot for the article. And
Urban is a wonderful thinker.

282
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,600
He's a great man. And in this
case, he was convinced. I

283
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,040
persuaded it. And so I don't
think it's an either or. I think

284
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,180
there is a species mind. There
is a collective mind to the

285
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,720
species. There is ways in which
we can tap into that mind in

286
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,320
various contexts, but there is
also an individuated mind that's

287
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,840
alive within the context of the
species mind. And I do think

288
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,980
that, to me, the universe seems
to want, wants to create the

289
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:07,200
opportunity and to enhance
individuality, we have two

290
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,020
truths that are operating here.
One is the truth of

291
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,780
connectivity, the truth that we
are all connected, the truth

292
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,500
that there are larger patterns
of knowing and there's a larger

293
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,080
connective tissue to the
universe. And we are discovering

294
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,520
that at all sorts of levels. But
the other truth is that the

295
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,180
truth that the universe seems to
want to seed and encourage

296
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,460
individuality. It's a both and
situation. I think reincarnation

297
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,120
speaks to the individuality side
of it, and in terms of why these

298
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,140
children remember and most of us
don't, that's an empirical

299
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,560
question, Stevenson says. And he
says, we don't know, we just

300
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,780
don't have enough research, but
he has a hypothesis. He finds

301
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,420
that about 60% of his cases, of
his children in their previous

302
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:06,720
life died violently, and the
symptoms of a violent death is a

303
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,400
traumatic ending of life. And
out of the remaining 40% of

304
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,780
majority of those died suddenly
within 24 hours of the onset of

305
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,780
an injury or an illness or they
died with an acute sense of

306
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,980
unfinished business. So a woman
who dies in childbirth, all her

307
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,640
energy is giving birth to this
child wanting to take care of a

308
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,600
child. Our business man has been
working on a corporate merger

309
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,840
for years and years, and is just
going through and suddenly he

310
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,620
dies. So either traumatically,
suddenly, or with an acute sense

311
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,600
of unfinished business. It seems
to create a kind of a pull to

312
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,840
finish that business, to stay
connected. We find that these

313
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,220
children reincarnate faster than
the population at large and

314
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,000
closer to home than the
population at large. Average

315
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,020
time interval between the death
of the first personality the

316
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,560
birth of the second personality
for these children two and a

317
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,440
half years. Average range is 50
miles from the birthplace of the

318
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,200
first personality to the
birthplace of the second

319
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,240
personality. When we do studies
in hypnosis with the larger

320
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,080
population, there have been
several studies studying

321
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,640
hundreds and up to 1000 people,
and we try to get a demographic

322
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,300
for people who don't remember
their previous lives

323
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,120
spontaneously. You have to you
would you have to evoke that

324
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,320
memory and bring it forward in
some way. We find that the cycle

325
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,020
time is much longer,
approximately one life per

326
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:46,000
century, right? One life a
century, nine to seven years, is

327
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,720
what one research team found.
And so it seems that we're

328
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,420
incarnating faster now than we
did in times past. And it seems

329
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,880
to me that part of that is
because they're sending more

330
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,200
opportunities to have varied
experiences. You know, if you

331
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,720
were alive in the 25th century
Egypt, and then not too much

332
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,080
going on, that's different in
the 24th century, you know, it's

333
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,220
just not a whole lot of change.
But now there's so much change,

334
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,000
so much variety. People are
coming back a little faster. But

335
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,240
if your person dies when they're
65 you know, average 3035, years

336
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,680
of birth time before they come
back into another lifetime. But

337
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,100
these children come back very
fast. Two and a half years. It's

338
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,120
almost like they bounce back.
And they've got an unusual

339
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,220
attachment between these two
lives. One other question, yeah,

340
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,860
are you going to be dealing with
channeling at all? Not really.

341
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:50,680
That's some of those variations
coming from Yeah, can you repeat

342
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,040
the question? Or at least, will
I be addressing channeling? And

343
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,500
I just hadn't intended to here.
It's just kind. Of it poses a

344
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,260
separate set of theoretical
issues that we'd have to

345
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,560
address. Yes, I just

346
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,859
Audience 2: had a question about
I just started reading your

347
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:14,519
book, and got about a third of
the way through it. And one of

348
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,119
the things that struck me, and I
haven't read anything else about

349
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:23,899
it first that I've started, it
struck me that one of the things

350
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:30,799
you were saying was that that
children, that children are the

351
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,079
ones that seem to be the most
believable, and because they

352
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:42,579
haven't had all the other input
in you know, so is that where

353
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:47,259
the research goes then, as I
know, I've read some of them

354
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:51,159
that you put in later that were
not children. Yeah, it just

355
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,739
seems so much more believable
with the children.

356
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,580
Chris Bache: Two bodies of
evidence, one body of evidence

357
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,480
that comes from Stevenson's
research is all focused on

358
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,200
children, and he likes them,
because some adults do suddenly

359
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,080
develop a spontaneous memory of
a former life. They travel

360
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,540
somewhere, they go to a city
they've never been in before,

361
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,820
and all of a sudden they know
their way around, and they have

362
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,080
that deja vu kind of feeling.
But the problem is that there's

363
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,740
so many opportunities where they
might have accumulated that

364
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,320
information. Normally, it's hard
to eliminate that. Two year old,

365
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,900
we got a better chance of
eliminating the possibility

366
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,200
because we monitor our children
carefully. We know who's had

367
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,740
access we know what information
they've had access to. So that's

368
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,320
a nice population. That's why
Stevenson focuses on that in

369
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,280
past lives, therapy, not always,
but most of the time. We're

370
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,760
dealing with adults, but that's
a different population, because

371
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,260
here we've done something to
awaken a memory, either massage

372
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,100
or meditation, more commonly
hypnosis. So there we're dealing

373
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,720
with a different population,
which generates a difference, a

374
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,620
different body of data, and we
have to sort of sift that data

375
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,220
using different criteria, and I
discuss the differences in those

376
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,760
two populations in life cycles,
yeah,

377
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,160
Audience 2: I just want to say
one other thing. This is just

378
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,520
kind of a funny thing that
happened to me when I was

379
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,720
reading your book, and I was
reading it last night, and it's

380
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,800
always been in my head that I
used to be an Indian. What you

381
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,300
know, but I went to sleep after
reading your book, and during

382
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,060
the night, I got to be an Indian
all night. I thought

383
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,520
Margaret Hiller: to myself, Oh,
is that? What

384
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,680
Chris Bache: was that? I'm sure
it was just a dream. Carnation,

385
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,880
yeah. True, then just think of,
look at everybody in this room.

386
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:53,080
Just imagine how many centuries,
millennia of experience are

387
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,880
tucked inside these bodies that
we have. And what's the most

388
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,740
natural thing in the world that
something might awaken a

389
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,000
particular memory. It's just the
most natural thing in the world.

390
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,620
Once you understand that inside
you, your consciousness and your

391
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,660
body, your habits of mind, are
grounded in 1000s and 1000s of

392
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,840
years of history, and when and
your relationships are grounded

393
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,820
in 1000s of years of history.
It's like just you start living

394
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,900
in a different time, saturated
universe, and you start giving

395
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,540
yourself permission to embrace
some of the things about your

396
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,860
life that have always been
there, but maybe you never

397
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,700
really embraced because our
current system, which said

398
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,520
you've only been alive as long
as this body has been alive,

399
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,880
didn't give you an explanation
for why it's there, like this

400
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:57,040
interest in Indian culture,
aptitudes, alright? So this is,

401
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,260
I'm not even talking these
aren't the two I want you to pay

402
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:05,880
attention. It's you're looking
for your first encounter with

403
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,740
this material. What the kind of
here are my favorite books on to

404
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:17,520
go into what is Roger Wilber,
who died just about two years

405
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,380
ago. He's now open to bleacher
seats. Hey, Roger. Roger was a

406
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:31,220
Jung Ian therapist. Jung Ian
therapist got involved in past

407
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,240
lives therapy. He became one of
the great past lives therapists.

408
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,180
He's trained hundreds and
hundreds of therapists, and if

409
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,620
you are looking for one book by
one therapist who takes you into

410
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,820
the methodology of past lives
therapy takes you into cases,

411
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,920
discusses those cases in a very
intelligent fashion, gives you

412
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,840
historical background. He's a
good historian. He's a wonderful

413
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,580
therapist. This. Is my favorite
book. I mean, there's a number

414
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,520
of very good authors writing
people who are past lives

415
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,640
therapists. Brian Weiss is a
very popular one many of you

416
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,740
have read. But to me, Roger is
he's just one of my favorite

417
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,600
authors. In this way, he just,
he gives you cases, he helps you

418
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,340
understand because what's really
important about reincarnation is

419
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,060
not just the fact of it, but
it's the other concept karma,

420
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,780
cause and effect, that there is
a cause and effect relationship

421
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,840
that links us, and it's all
cause and effect. I mean,

422
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,780
there's we know our world is
saturated physically with cause

423
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,320
and effect. And Roger is showing
that details the way our psyches

424
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,220
are also part of a larger cause
and effect process that we are

425
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:52,960
constantly drawing upon a matrix
of causation which creates

426
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,460
conditions within which we
experience life, how we think,

427
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,100
how we Feel, whether we're
introvert or extrovert, whether

428
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,280
we're attracted to sports,
whether we like mental games,

429
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:11,880
physical games, whether we like
bonds or brunettes, whether we

430
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,800
are we have to create a will
die, or whether we're kind of a

431
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,100
goal on kind of guy. These
things, everything has cause.

432
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,880
Everything has history behind
it, so much so. But by the time

433
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:32,060
you read enough cases, you begin
to realize everything comes from

434
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:39,080
somewhere. Nothing comes from
nowhere. You like cooking, if

435
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,180
you like Carl, if you like
adventure, if you are a home

436
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,760
body, if you're a foreign body,
everything comes from somewhere.

437
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:55,060
Things which you were naturally
good at, they started somewhere

438
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,780
in a small experience, which
then was cultivated and then was

439
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,680
cultivated until eventually it
manifest in the life as a

440
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,480
natural aptitude. Mozart started
writing his music when he was

441
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,680
three years old. If you ever
listen to his first concerto,

442
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,720
when this is written by four or
five year old child, you know,

443
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,900
how does that kind of knowledge
present itself in this genius?

444
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,400
Well, in one time true, we have
no real way to explain that. We

445
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:34,160
hypothesize genetics, but in
reincarnational framework, it

446
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,120
said, This is not his first time
with music. He's worked music

447
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,620
before. His aptitudes are there,
and we find this is true with

448
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:47,080
people who are, for example,
good with guns. There'll be a

449
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,960
case somebody's good with guns,
always had an interest in guns,

450
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,680
always been a good shot. Well,
turns out that, you know, he's

451
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,920
got history with guns. He was a
marshal of a previous life. He

452
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:03,060
did this or that the other So
Roger Wilber is just one of my

453
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,600
favorite authors. It's an easy
read, and Anne Marie has this

454
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,420
one in the bookstore. Yeah, I
just

455
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,200
Unknown: want to ask, since you
mentioned karma, the definition

456
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,400
that I keep hearing over and
over recently is much more like

457
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,960
retribution. It's like you did
this, and this gets that the

458
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,900
original definition that I that
I knew of was that you hate

459
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,500
getting opportunities to learn
something, and if you don't

460
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,200
learn it, you get another
opportunity to learn it. Would

461
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,400
you clarify for us,

462
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,780
Chris Bache: karma has a bad
reputation when it's put into

463
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,940
Puritan cultures and there's a
vengeful God in the background.

464
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:49,300
And karma is like Whitman shape,
you know. And all karma means is

465
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,980
that which causes. It means a
volitional Act, a chosen Act,

466
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,240
which which causes the pair is
actually karma, the pop up,

467
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:03,000
cause and effect. So cause and
effect. It's just cause. It's,

468
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,920
it's totally neutral. It's,
there are some causes, but if

469
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,680
you die by being thrown off a
horse and you have a phobia of

470
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,060
horses in your next lifetime,
that's cause and effect. It's

471
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,200
not because you did anything
wrong and you're being punished.

472
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,860
It's just neutral cause and
effect. If you cheated somebody

473
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,240
in business, and your next
lifetime, you find yourself

474
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,380
being cheated in business.
That's karma, cause and effect,

475
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,320
which has a moral quality, but
perspective. That's why, in life

476
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,740
cycles, it's going to come up on
the screen in a minute. I

477
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,000
differentiate between moral
karma and non moral karma, you

478
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,840
know, it's just karma. Is karma.
It's just cause and effect. We

479
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,560
have had a tendency to interpret
karma in terms of punishment,

480
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,800
but punishment, you know? So my
view of the universe is the

481
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,400
universe is not interested in
punishment. The universe is only

482
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,860
interested in growth. Growth is
like, you know, if you fail a

483
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,400
student on a test, you're not
punishing them, you're just

484
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,460
giving them feedback on what and
they haven't learned certain

485
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,980
things, and you give them
opportunities to learn it again.

486
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:26,060
So anything which is not learned
in one lifetime, you'll have

487
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,020
opportunities, not necessarily
in your immediate life, but in

488
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,940
sub subsequent life, to learn.
We also have a very linear

489
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,840
concept of reincarnation, so
life a leads to life B, which

490
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,440
leads to life C, which leads to
life E. Turns out it's not

491
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,740
nearly that simple to me. Life
is like playing cards. You got

492
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,340
52 cards in the deck, but your
hand only has five or seven

493
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,000
whatever card depending on what
you're playing. You may have 100

494
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,860
lifetimes behind you, but in one
life, not all of those 100

495
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,480
lifetimes are equally relevant.
Only some of those lives are

496
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,780
relevant to this particular
life. So they are the major

497
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,160
lives for this life. What's
going on with all your other

498
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,980
lives? They're kind of like in
the background. They're kind of

499
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,420
like in the choir, waiting. You
know, they're just kind of

500
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:29,780
quiescent. So in one lifetime,
in the 21st Century, the threads

501
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,560
of your what you're dealing with
may, may come from your most

502
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,980
recent life, but not
necessarily, it may come from

503
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,200
the life of the 17th century, a
life in the 14th century, a life

504
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,860
in the 10th century, and those
threads kind of come together

505
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,140
and are woven into the issues
that you're challenging yourself

506
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:55,420
with in this lifetime. And I
also tell my students it's a

507
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,420
wrong formula to think
reincarnation gives you an

508
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,300
opportunity to get it right.
That's too short a time frame.

509
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,080
The universe isn't interested in
just you getting it right. The

510
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,340
universe is interested in
building galaxies, building

511
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,120
solar systems. It's interested
in, I mean, the universe thinks

512
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,380
in time frames of billions of
years. Why should the universe

513
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,360
be only concerned in a very
small 100,000 year time frames.

514
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:30,380
The universe is creating giants,
giants of soul, and so it's not

515
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,680
getting it right. That may be a
short term. It's really about

516
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,740
the open ended development of
our capacity over vast stretches

517
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:45,700
of time. It's about creating
genius. It's about just creating

518
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:53,260
more and more and more potential
inside the human form. So it's

519
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,040
much more open ended than we've
had a tendency to think in the

520
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,080
past.

521
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,020
Margaret Hiller: I love the
phrase you use last time you're

522
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,940
here, that reincarnation is the
universe's way to roll forward

523
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,260
information and intelligence. Am
I remembering?

524
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,040
Chris Bache: The universe is
like ecology. It wastes nothing.

525
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,860
Everything we learn is rolled
forward into future learning. It

526
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,980
just keeps somehow, the way I
see it, you know, evolution is

527
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,760
up to a time the universe is
learning expresses itself in

528
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,840
creating a whole new species.
You know, species evolve

529
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,460
together somewhere along the
line, sufficient consciousness

530
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,640
is concretized to produce
individuals, and then evolution

531
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,120
can evolve not only whole
species, but it can evolve

532
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,020
individuals within the species.
But the principle is the same in

533
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,980
both. It folds forward the
learning of the group, or the

534
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,240
learning of individuals, into
future manifestation. So

535
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,000
basically, nature recycles. It
always is folding out. Holding

536
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,120
our learning forward, taking it
someplace we haven't been

537
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,480
before.

538
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,400
Audience 3: It saves everything.
I've been hearing a lot about

539
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:17,040
empirical knowledge and data
collecting. Where do you place

540
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,900
the concept of all right, a lot
of people's journey right now is

541
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,380
getting to a higher level of
consciousness, developing

542
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:30,320
yourself spiritually. Where do
you place? Intuitive knowing you

543
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,620
know not anything gathered from
books, but an intuitive knowing

544
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,840
and a feeling of rightness. This
is right, and it rings true, you

545
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,880
know, and it may go against the
mainstream of modern thought,

546
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,240
you know, and even
reincarnation. And then your

547
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,400
inner knowing says this is what
I believe. Regardless of what's

548
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,280
out there, there's an inner
knowing that's telling you this

549
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,460
that

550
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,379
Chris Bache: is one of the many
qualities which we're

551
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:02,699
developing. Up, and you know
what? Our consciousness faces

552
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:07,619
out and consciousness faces in,
right? So we're learning a whole

553
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,219
lot about what's out there, and
then other people seem to be

554
00:40:11,219 --> 00:40:15,179
more, kind of more concentrated
on learning to trust what's in

555
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:22,159
here, going deeper within, and
learning to listen and learning

556
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,779
to affirm the voice that rises
from within. Creative artist,

557
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:34,759
you know, intuitive scientist,
good parents, just learning to

558
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:38,119
trust the voice which rises from
within in their circumstance,

559
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:42,219
our culture doesn't support that
very much right now, because we

560
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:47,619
are so oriented towards external
verification. But if knowledge

561
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,579
phase is in and certainly the
memories of your previous lives,

562
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:56,919
which give you the texture of
what you perceive to be true,

563
00:40:56,919 --> 00:41:01,079
what you feel to be true, then I
think developing that inner

564
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:05,219
intuition. You know, it's
critically important, really

565
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:10,979
important. I'm going to put the
other two books up here, just to

566
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,619
keep us a little on track,

567
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,920
Carl Bohm and Anne Marie has her
work. She has two books, and

568
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,640
this is her first book. Carl
Bohm is an interesting woman,

569
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,460
very grounded, very matter of
fact, a nurse got into this kind

570
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,720
of only because her own child,
she had a child. She wasn't

571
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,360
really interested in
reincarnation, but she had a

572
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,600
child who started having
nightmares, started having

573
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,160
nightmares and night traumas,
and like any mother you know,

574
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:57,100
want to take care of her child.
And she began to pay attention.

575
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:01,860
She began to read. She began to
understand Stevenson's work and

576
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:07,920
reincarnation, and she was eight
long story short, she was able

577
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,940
to help her child uncover the
trauma that was disturbing his

578
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,820
sleep and helped him make that
conscious and remember enough of

579
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,580
it, and then it washed through
him, and it left him alone, and

580
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,200
it healed him. And she began to
realize that if this is true for

581
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,220
her child, there must be other
children out there. Stevenson is

582
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,740
not interested in healing
children. He's interested in

583
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,220
documenting the cases, but there
are other children who are

584
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,900
living unresolved issues from
their most usually, their most

585
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:46,360
recent life, and she began to
help put things up on the web.

586
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,420
And when she put things up on
the web, she started getting

587
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,860
hundreds of people writing her,
saying, My child is like this.

588
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,300
Can you help me? And to make a
long story short, she kind of

589
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,840
became a clearing house for
cases and information of work

590
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,620
from parents who were concerned
to help their children deal with

591
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,640
memories that were disturbing
them in some form or another.

592
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,060
And I find her a very grounded
person. She's really she's well

593
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,460
read. She documents her sources.
Well, it's an easy read. It's a

594
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,360
very inspiring read, because her
cases are just so provocative.

595
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,760
She wrote a second book. What
was the name of it? Do you

596
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,600
remember Andrew read it?
Children from heaven, or

597
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:44,140
something from heaven? Memories
of heaven, something I uh, she

598
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,780
became eventually, you know, she
now, this is what she does

599
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,700
professionally. But I love cases
where people just come out of

600
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,400
the from the bottom up, where
they didn't, weren't trained in

601
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,340
this, but they kind of just come
out of the circumstances of

602
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,720
their life. If you read this
book, I think you'll see that

603
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,300
kind of woman. She just is a
compassionate, competent she's a

604
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:12,540
nurse, and she has one story
after another of children and

605
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,720
she has and she's speaking to
parents. She says, What? How do

606
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,620
you how do you treat a child who
has a spontaneous nightmare?

607
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,500
What's the best way to do and
her advice is, attend, listen,

608
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,100
encourage, and you don't have to
worry about it. You can trust

609
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,240
that the system is going to work
itself out. If you push it away,

610
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,260
it'll stay. If you let it into
the room, it will resolve

611
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,980
itself. It will come forward and
resolve itself. And it's not

612
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,020
injurious for children to have
these memories. You don't have

613
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,540
to worry that they're going to
be overwhelmed with something

614
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,440
that they cannot handle. The
system is self regulating in a

615
00:44:50,440 --> 00:45:00,240
very wise and profound way. And
life cycles is the first. First

616
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,960
book I wrote. Now this is, I
guess that's was published in

617
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,920
1990 so it's, it's been around
for a while. It's over 20, close

618
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:15,180
to 25 years old. As a young
academic, I found Stevenson's

619
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,020
cases really important, really
powerful. So this book,

620
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,820
basically, there's a chapter on
the evidence. And I summarize

621
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,120
some of Stevenson's cases, and I
try to make them more reader

622
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,140
friendly than Stevenson does.
And I summarize about, I think,

623
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,400
four or five of his cases, and I
summarize about four or five

624
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,200
cases from past lives therapy,
and draw from different people,

625
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:44,260
but basically my position after
we get past the evidence

626
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,420
chapter, my position is there is
overwhelming empirical evidence

627
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:55,540
that reincarnation is a fact of
life. What do we do now? What's

628
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,900
it tell us? What's it say about
what difference does it make how

629
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,860
we live our life? What does it
tell us about our identity? What

630
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,340
does it tell us about our
relationships? Turns out, the

631
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,160
biggest chapter in the book is a
chapter on reincarnation in

632
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,660
Christianity, and because it's
because most of my students were

633
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,360
in my classes, they were coming
out of a Christian background.

634
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,680
They read Stevenson's book. They
were convinced by the cases, but

635
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,760
their religion told them that
they couldn't accept these

636
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,260
cases, and they were caught
between a rock and a hard place.

637
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,040
And so I wanted to sort of say,
well, you know, do you think

638
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,740
Christianity could ever
incorporate this evidence?

639
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,200
Christianity first rejected
evolution, but now, you know,

640
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,700
all sorts of thinkers are
showing us how you can integrate

641
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,000
evolutionary theory with
Christian principles. Could

642
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,100
Christianity ever incorporate
reincarnation evidence, and what

643
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,680
would it look like? What would a
reincarnation affirming

644
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,540
reincarnation Christianity look
like? So I outline what I

645
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,880
consider the minimum and a
maximum option that's available

646
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,940
for people who come out of a
Christian background. And

647
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,420
there's a chapter on the family,
you know, how it changes our

648
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,840
thinking about having children
and the children who come to us,

649
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,800
because from this perspective,
we don't create our children,

650
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,200
you know, and the qualities that
are in them are not simply the

651
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,720
sum of the qualities of the
parents or our

652
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,420
grandparents absolve. They are
whole and complete unto

653
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,180
themselves. They bring the
lineage unto themselves. Our job

654
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,080
is simply to help them unfold
their potential and help them

655
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,920
actualize the being that they
already are. And if you approach

656
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,700
children in that way, I think
you get better results than if

657
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,240
you expect them to stay close to
the root of your family

658
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,440
tradition, it gives us more
permission. So there's just all

659
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,540
sorts of topics that I try to I
also address. There's a chapter

660
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,120
on what's the Did Jesus teach
reincarnation? There are some

661
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,840
people, you know, Jesus did
teach reincarnation. My first

662
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,440
love, academically, was in New
Testament research, and I

663
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,260
learned Greek and Hebrew. I
mean, I really want to get close

664
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:20,220
to the original sources, and I
don't think there is sufficient

665
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,760
evidence right now that compels
the conclusion that Jesus taught

666
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,640
reincarnation, but there are
some very interesting,

667
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,820
provocative possibilities. And
of course, in many of the

668
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:36,020
Gnostic Gospels, it has Jesus
teaching reincarnation, and in

669
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,140
many of the early communities of
the first 200 years of the

670
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,660
church's life, reincarnation is
a very common idea in some of

671
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:50,500
these communities. So are women?
The role of women as equal to

672
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,140
the role of men in the church?
But we know what happened to

673
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,800
that one. You know, that went
out by the fourth century, and

674
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,740
the reincarnation belief was
that went out in the sixth

675
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,760
century, the second Council
Constantinople, they kind of put

676
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,380
the kibosh on that one. So I
asked the question, Why? Why did

677
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,860
reincarnation? Why did
Christianity reject

678
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:18,180
reincarnation when it was
circulating, that's a version of

679
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,060
the gospel in the early church.
Was it? Is it because it's

680
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:28,100
incompatible with anything Jesus
really taught? And I rely on a

681
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,100
man named Gettys McGregor, who's
a Scottish theologian who's

682
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,880
written numerous books on
Christianity and reincarnation,

683
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,800
and his position is Christianity
rejected reincarnation for

684
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:44,500
political reasons, not for
metaphysical reasons. In a

685
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:50,500
nutshell, in the context of the
fourth century, the Roman Empire

686
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,160
is falling apart. The Visigoths
are at the gate. Everything is

687
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,020
collapsing. The church has just
barely gotten a foothold in the

688
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,160
culture of the Roman. Empire
that just been welcomed on

689
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,820
footing with the pagan
religions. Things are just

690
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,400
beginning to look up. By the
fourth century, and all of a

691
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,740
sudden, the Roman Empire is
falling apart and society is

692
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,060
fragmenting. We're on the eve of
the Dark Ages. In that context,

693
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,160
the church, I think they were
doing, trying to do a good job.

694
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,620
I think they were asking the
right questions. They asked,

695
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,720
What would Jesus want us to do?
What does Jesus want us to do?

696
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,680
And they became convinced that a
secret to the survival of the

697
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,180
church lay in a highly
centralized authority, and they

698
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,840
create model on Roman
government. So you had the

699
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:46,600
Emperor, you had the Senate,
Carl, bishops, and so on, so

700
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,560
forth, down to the people. So it
was a vertical, top down system,

701
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,580
highly centralized authority,
Grace flow through these

702
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:57,880
channels you couldn't have it
wasn't coming up. It was coming

703
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,980
down through a narrow set of
channels. In that context,

704
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,940
reincarnation, you can see
threatened that centralized

705
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,400
authority, because if
reincarnation and karma are

706
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,880
true, everybody is ultimately
responsible for their own

707
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,780
salvation. You do not need
priests, you do not need

708
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,560
bishops, and you do not need the
Pope. Everybody is working it

709
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:25,640
out on their own. They thought
that was just too it threatened,

710
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,000
if we went this way, would be
weakened and diluted. And they

711
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,700
basically said, we're not going
to go that way. We're going to

712
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,840
keep it highly centralized.
Okay, if that worked for the

713
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:41,260
fifth, sixth century. But does
that work now? Right now, I

714
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,860
think that's holding us back,
because, to my way of thinking,

715
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,860
the belief that we only live one
lifetime is actually

716
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,620
reincarnation. Is the missing
piece living in an intelligent

717
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,440
universe. If you believe that
God is intelligent, if you

718
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,520
believe that there is wisdom in
existence, if you believe that

719
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,940
there is compassion in
existence, but you believe that

720
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,600
we only live one time, and you
can't see it. You can't see the

721
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,080
intelligence of life. If you
believe we only live one time,

722
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,220
you can't really see the
compassion of existence. If you

723
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:21,800
don't understand the fact of
reincarnation, once you kind of

724
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,400
open up to that possibility,
then you can look at these

725
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,760
pictures that we saw at the
beginning of the talk of these

726
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,960
galaxies and Nebula this vast
expanse, and you can begin to

727
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,800
see the causal matrix where the
intelligence is expressing

728
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,980
itself inside Our lives and
inside the circumstances we find

729
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,360
ourselves in. And so if
Christianity had a reason for

730
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,860
rejecting rebirth, for its
survival at one point, now, I

731
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:56,020
think if we reject rebirth, it
undermines their teaching of a

732
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:00,300
compassionate, loving God. And I
personally, I think

733
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,120
Christianity, I think this
community is a symptom. It's a

734
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,460
sample of Christianity pivoting
on that past and opening up to a

735
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,020
new a new understanding, a
deeper understanding of the

736
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:21,140
gospel. So if you read these
three books, and you can always

737
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,100
go back to Stevenson and
Winifred Lucas, but if you read

738
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,060
these three books, the vision
that opens is that life is a

739
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:36,920
cycle, and the way I like to
think of it is expansion and

740
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,820
contraction. When we die, we
expand into soul awareness. When

741
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:48,700
we're born, we contract into
individual egoic awareness. The

742
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:53,800
ego egoic awareness evolves. It
changes over time, but the

743
00:53:53,800 --> 00:54:00,360
rhythm of life is this expansion
and contraction. So you want to

744
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,180
do a quick exercise. This is
what I call the yoga of

745
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,120
reincarnation. Stand up for a
second.

746
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,460
We'll close our eyes in a
minute. But this is what I'd

747
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:23,600
like you to do. Put your hands
together and picture in the

748
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:31,280
middle of your hands light now
when you breathe out and expand

749
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,340
our arms, like open them up, and
then bring them back together.

750
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,260
And then just keep it up when
you're ready, close your eyes

751
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,760
and this picture every time you
open your hands and bring them

752
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:55,480
together. It's 100 years of
time. When you die, you move

753
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,840
into the soul condition. You
remember who you are, what you

754
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,960
are, you. When you're born, you
become small and focused

755
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:11,099
and picture yourself every time
you bring your hands together, a

756
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:19,979
different sex, different gender,
a different color, a different

757
00:55:19,979 --> 00:55:24,319
country. Different

758
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:38,420
language, we die, we expand.
We're born. We contrary, we

759
00:55:49,088 --> 00:55:53,888
you might find that this ball of
light in the center of your

760
00:55:53,888 --> 00:56:02,280
closing hands is actually
getting brighter, because every

761
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:08,760
time you do this, the knowledge
of the center is growing

762
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,260
stronger, the knowledge base,
the conscious base, is getting

763
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:21,140
stronger. And if we stay doing
this for about an hour and a

764
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,500
half.

765
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,420
Audience 3: Just imagine how
much light we would be bringing

766
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:35,539
Chris Bache: into that center.
Now open up your Listen, really,

767
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:43,899
really fortunately, stretch and
then born into this center. Move

768
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:46,599
your arms in different
directions. Really open it up,

769
00:56:46,899 --> 00:56:47,679
knock your neighbors.

770
00:56:57,699 --> 00:57:04,559
The Yoga of rebirth, expansion
and contraction.

771
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,100
Unknown: All right?

772
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,500
Chris Bache: Why can't you
remember our former lives as so

773
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:33,140
great? Why do we forget what is
the purpose of forgetting our

774
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,040
previous lives? Why go through
all that written to die to

775
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,900
remember who we are? The
reincarnation is true, and I

776
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:46,120
think it has to do, actually,
with it's critical at a certain

777
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:51,760
point in our in human evolution,
forgetfulness is necessary to

778
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:57,280
reduce the discontinuity that is
responsible for exponential

779
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,000
change.

780
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,500
Unknown: Say that again,

781
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,340
Chris Bache: forgetting, is
responsible for producing

782
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:10,200
discontinuity, and the
discontinuity is responsible for

783
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:15,540
exponential change. So imagine
your God, which is not difficult

784
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:20,840
for some of you, right? You got
you're creating a system, and

785
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,740
what you want to do is evolve
life into more complex forms as

786
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,160
fast as possible. You could
create a human being and give

787
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:33,320
them 100,000 years of life,
harvest them and then see how

788
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,520
much he or she has burned. Or
you could create a human being,

789
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,140
give them 100 years, get the
same 100,000 years, but break it

790
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:46,360
up into 100 year increments, and
every 100 years, change places

791
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,480
on the board. You are a man now
you're a woman. You're a

792
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,200
soldier. Now you're a poet. You
were rich now you're poor. You

793
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,720
keep changing positions in life.
At the end of the same 100,000

794
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:03,120
years, which one of those two
options is going to produce a

795
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,980
more complex, textured
individual most of us would

796
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:13,200
choose, I think the 100 year
increments. Why? Because variety

797
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,780
is the spice of life. Variety
causes us to grow in ways that

798
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:25,940
sameness doesn't How do you
create variety? You have to

799
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:31,520
create discontinuity. You have
to forget who you were, what you

800
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,500
knew in one life, and begin anew
in a new set of circumstances.

801
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,020
If you didn't remember what,
there would be no learning in

802
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,720
the end, you have to remember
your former lives sooner or

803
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,340
later. But the time to remember
isn't necessarily right here

804
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:55,000
right now. It's when you die,
then you remember when you're

805
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,740
born, you forget. So it's kind
of like I tell my students, you

806
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,400
know? So if you have a fight
with your boyfriend or your

807
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,180
girlfriend right before you come
to class, you can't pay

808
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,840
attention to what I'm saying.
Your mind is still out in that

809
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:15,300
fight. You're just not here. I
think you have to forget your

810
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,920
life in order to learn something
new as fast as we wanted you to

811
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,020
learn at a university classroom,
so this forgetting is important

812
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,840
in order to create the
conditions for accelerated

813
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,140
learning.

814
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:35,719
Unknown: I was wondering I
recently heard a constant of

815
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:41,319
that of perception. So do we
bring something about our

816
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:46,359
perception, not necessarily
memories for all of us, but our

817
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:50,619
perception from our past lives,
like someone was saying that we

818
01:00:50,619 --> 01:00:54,219
have our five senses through
which we see the out of the

819
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:58,779
world, then we have our mind
integrates the information, then

820
01:00:58,779 --> 01:01:03,359
we take action, but that the
Joker in the deck is our

821
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,259
perception. We all have a
different perception. And could

822
01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:13,319
that perception kind of be what
we bring in from our past life,

823
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:18,659
even though we forget the life?
I mean, I have no clue, but I

824
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:21,979
know I have perception that's
been a joker in the deck many

825
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:26,599
times, and that when I start to,
when I start to see that that

826
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:32,479
perception is distorted, then
I'm learning, yeah,

827
01:01:33,619 --> 01:01:36,139
Chris Bache: sometimes they're
distorted, it's distorted and

828
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:39,919
needs to be tweaked, and
sometimes it's accurate and

829
01:01:39,979 --> 01:01:44,379
doesn't need to be tweaked. But,
yeah, I mean, basically you're

830
01:01:44,379 --> 01:01:47,079
pointing to like, what you were
talking about with intuition,

831
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:51,939
perceptions, gut, hunches,
feelings, all of those things

832
01:01:51,939 --> 01:01:55,119
carry through. We may not
remember the details of our

833
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,479
previous life. I mean, I don't
remember the details of my

834
01:01:58,479 --> 01:02:02,039
previous life this. I didn't
until I started digging in the

835
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:07,019
basement with hypnosis and
whatnot, but I but they were

836
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:11,519
still those perceptions, those
aptitudes, those affinities were

837
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:19,979
still present. Now here's one
other last thought. I don't

838
01:02:19,979 --> 01:02:23,719
think we're going to keep
forgetting our former lives when

839
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:29,959
we incarnate. I think if you do
this exercise and it's just try

840
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:35,599
this at home and do this yoga
reincarnation for 1520, minutes,

841
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:41,199
sooner or later, it seems to me,
if we reincarnate long enough,

842
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:45,639
often enough, the consciousness
that we incarnate into is

843
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,479
getting stronger, stronger,
brighter, clearer, sooner or

844
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:55,779
later, it seems to me that the
soul, which is the consciousness

845
01:02:55,779 --> 01:02:58,719
that integrates all of our
lives, that's waiting for us,

846
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:04,019
that We return to when we die,
that soul is going to incarnate

847
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:08,879
on Earth, intact, without
amnesia, without loss of memory.

848
01:03:10,259 --> 01:03:15,239
That I think, is the next step
in human evolution, is the birth

849
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:20,779
of the soul in history. And we
know that the soul we take on

850
01:03:20,779 --> 01:03:23,599
more qualities, more soul
qualities, the older we get.

851
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,419
That's why we talk about
someone's an old soul, someone's

852
01:03:26,419 --> 01:03:30,979
a young soul. We know what we're
talking toward, but sooner or

853
01:03:30,979 --> 01:03:34,639
later, I think we're going to
see we'll look back and we'll

854
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:39,859
see that this forgetfulness was
actually part of the design. But

855
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:43,179
that doesn't mean we're trapped
in it forever and ever. See the

856
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:46,179
way the system, the way
reincarnation is believe now is

857
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:48,879
that once you achieve
enlightenment, once you achieve

858
01:03:48,879 --> 01:03:51,699
some type of spiritual
breakthrough, once you wake up

859
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:55,839
to the divine being that you are
and we all are, then what

860
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:00,839
happens you leave the system.
The Hindu first Hindu concept,

861
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:05,519
of reading of enlightenment was
Moshe. Moshe means escape,

862
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:10,679
escape the physical world,
escape Samsara, escape into the

863
01:04:10,739 --> 01:04:15,479
spiritual world. But to me,
that's that's just the first

864
01:04:15,479 --> 01:04:19,799
approximation. That's a first
understanding the ultimate goal

865
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:25,519
is not to escape. It's to wake
up here, so that heaven becomes

866
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:30,679
the condition on Earth, so that
eventually we will be born and

867
01:04:30,679 --> 01:04:34,399
we will not forget. We will have
complete knowledge of our entire

868
01:04:34,399 --> 01:04:38,539
history, and we will have a
deeper communion with the

869
01:04:38,899 --> 01:04:42,699
spiritual universe. We won't be
estranged from the physical,

870
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:47,559
from the spiritual reality. So
just because we forget now

871
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:50,259
doesn't mean we forget forever.

872
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,000
Audience 3: Yeah, going along
with this is a quote from Thomas

873
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:04,020
a campus. The Ring. If one knew
all, one would forgive all.

874
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:09,899
Chris Bache: The past, if one
knew all, one would forgive all.

875
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,359
Yes, what you just

876
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:21,260
Unknown: said about the ultimate
goal was that we would remember

877
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:21,680
everything.

878
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:28,099
Audience 2: How does it? It does
not fly in face of what we were

879
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:31,819
just talking about then about
it's good that it's like that

880
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:37,939
because we don't remember, and
we have all these different

881
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:41,919
hundreds of newer experiences,
being different people, being

882
01:05:41,919 --> 01:05:45,099
different things, and we put
those all together, and all of a

883
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:48,519
sudden you've got this wonderful
universe of knowledge. However,

884
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:54,579
what happens then, if we become
people that can remember all of

885
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:55,119
it all

886
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,939
Unknown: the time? Does that
what happens

887
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,880
Margaret Hiller: next? Yeah,
does that kind of limit our I

888
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,540
having

889
01:06:04,259 --> 01:06:06,959
Unknown: all the different
experiences and being have the

890
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:09,539
massive knowledge. You

891
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,360
Chris Bache: see the question,
if there is a reason for

892
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:18,780
forgetting, then what happens if
we don't have to forget anymore?

893
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:21,020
And it's very clear, all of a
sudden, we're playing a

894
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:25,640
different game. The game has
changed. It's a different system

895
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:30,440
with different rules. We don't
really know what that those

896
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,640
rules are going to be like, but
I think the system differs that

897
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,780
we will be playing a different
game. And I think, personally, I

898
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:44,320
think that the system is, we all
know we're in a global systems

899
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:47,080
crisis. We're all know that
we're at a dead end in history.

900
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,140
We all know that we can't keep
going the way we have been

901
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,380
going, or we're going to go
extinct as a species. You know?

902
01:06:53,380 --> 01:07:00,040
I mean, I hope that's not news
to anybody here. This culture,

903
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:06,120
this culture was created by the
ego, which means this culture

904
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,620
was created by a fragmented
psyche, a piece of knowledge

905
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,940
that's the only reason why
people can be happy themselves,

906
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,540
personally, why so many other
people are suffering is because

907
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:23,720
they only experience a very
narrow portion of the mind. They

908
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:28,520
don't experience other people's
pain. It's their pain. But if

909
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:35,660
we, if we were to become fully
conscious and fully in communion

910
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:39,920
with this deeper underlying
connective tissue, we would

911
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,760
create a different world, we
would create a different

912
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:47,380
culture. And I think there's a
tremendous psychic pressure

913
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:51,460
building, just as economic,
ecologically, economically,

914
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,160
politically, we know we need to
create a different world.

915
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:59,200
Spiritually, I think we are
growing into a different

916
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:03,540
identity, and I think these two
are reinforcing each other, so

917
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:09,060
that I think if we don't wake up
at a soul level, we probably

918
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:14,880
will go extinct at an ego level.
If we were to wake up at the

919
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,720
soul level, we would become a
different species. We would

920
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:25,520
become a species of Buddhas and
Christ, we would become awakened

921
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,660
being. And then ask yourself,
what could the human species

922
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:37,280
accomplish if we truly were
awake, as Christ was awake, as

923
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,940
the Buddha was awake, what could
we accomplish clearly we changed

924
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,120
the planet. There'd be nothing
that we couldn't do if that

925
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:50,080
happens. So I think we are in
the process. I think the design

926
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,600
is to push us into this deeper
sense of identity, so that we

927
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,440
have a deeper sense of
inclusiveness, so that we can

928
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,880
create a world as one author put
it a world that works for all

929
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,800
this, what I call the birth of
the diamond soul. I think we are

930
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:12,720
in the process of birthing the
diamond soul in history. And the

931
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:17,160
diamond soul is simply my way of
languaging the identity which we

932
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,420
have been cultivating for
hundreds of 1000s, possibly

933
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:24,920
millions of years the soul
identity, but the soul identity

934
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:31,700
conscious inside time and space.
And I think some of our great

935
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:36,260
saints and sages were prototypes
of that consciousness. That's

936
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:41,500
why they they teach radical
terms. They teach about the

937
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:45,820
family of humanity and the
oneness of God and the oneness

938
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:51,640
of life, those don't make sense
to egos that awakens in us, this

939
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:56,020
intuition that we know is true
because our soul knows it's

940
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:56,440
true.

941
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,180
Unknown: Yeah. Just reminds me
of a son who I call an idealist,

942
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:09,240
but he's got a lot of anger out
there about the psych guys, that

943
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:12,600
conspiracy thing, but he's
really saying what you just

944
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,000
said. He thinks you shouldn't
have to have money. You should

945
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,120
be able to create a world that
works for all. But instead of

946
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:22,980
being in a peaceful place like a
Buddha monkey, he's Yeah,

947
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:23,120
Buddha,

948
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,260
Chris Bache: well, I think all
of us have felt that anger. You

949
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:35,780
know, we feel that anger at
different times. That's,

950
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,140
there's, there's great truth
expressing itself in that anger.

951
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:49,840
There really is anger is tricky,
isn't it? It'll eat you up. It

952
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,500
really will just eat you up. And
on the one hand, you don't want

953
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:58,240
to eliminate the truth that
that's in it. On the other hand,

954
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:08,340
there is, there is, I mean, I
get angry. I get angry at things

955
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,060
like this, but it's not a place
you want to live from. It's not

956
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:16,980
a place you want to stay from,
and it requires, I think, an

957
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,720
understanding of a larger
landscape in order to put that

958
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,500
give that anger a creative
outlet, give that anger a place

959
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,760
to go, because anger ultimately
has to be tempered with

960
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:33,500
compassion so that it can mature
into wisdom, so it'll be wise

961
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:40,040
action, not destructive action.
But it's a tricky thing, because

962
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,380
it's there's a truth there

963
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:46,600
Unknown: to other people about
what the conspiracy part and

964
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,740
disputing that anger to others.
And I, you know, I see what I

965
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:55,600
learned for unity is quite the
opposite. What you just said was

966
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,960
so profound because it really
brought tonight. I'm not talking

967
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:10,380
about the son of something. Me.
I really wish I could inspire

968
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:10,980
him to be wise.

969
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:20,540
Chris Bache: He'll find his way
to it. Sometimes it's very

970
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,980
useful sometimes, I mean, I
value deep, introspective work,

971
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,340
so sometimes it's useful to
follow something like that to

972
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:32,480
its source, to really go into
history, to get at the very

973
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,660
roots of that anger. Because
sometimes, even though, if it's

974
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:38,660
true, it's an accurate
perception in the world, but

975
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,820
sometimes there's a there's a
cause for that deeper in our

976
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:47,800
personal history, which when we
get as a cause and clear the

977
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,580
cause of that anger at a
personal level, sometimes it

978
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:54,400
gives us a little we don't have
to let go of the truth, but we

979
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,720
can let go of the anger, you
know. So there's lots of ways

980
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,360
moving into it.

981
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:07,740
Unknown: I was thinking that
couldn't not just be anger,

982
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:11,640
but an elective frustration at

983
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:20,400
what is and what can be, and
that more people don't get it or

984
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:27,740
not making enough progress in
the in that direction, and, you

985
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,660
know, and being, you know,

986
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,520
unable to do anything about it,
yeah, and then it just turns

987
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,120
inward, yeah,

988
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,700
Chris Bache: my students are
angry, you know, they're trying

989
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:44,260
To make their way in the world,
and they know it's not working,

990
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,840
and it's getting worse. The sea
level is rising, the jobs are

991
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:56,740
moving. They're angry. But how
do you how do you use that

992
01:13:56,740 --> 01:14:09,660
perception in a way that doesn't
eat you alive? So shall we call

993
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:15,240
the close to the first segment
and Take 10 minutes be back

994
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:22,980
here? 1130 okay, I'm just

995
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:49,840
Margaret Hiller: Oh, yeah, what
happened? What time did you get

996
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,020
here?

997
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,420
Unknown: I had to do an
interview, three articles due

998
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,740
today for natural week. Oh.

999
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,820
Audience 3: You okay, and then I
told Mary to be a little bit

1000
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:12,000
late.

1001
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:25,160
Unknown: Looks like they're
recording it. Yeah, be nice to

1002
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,240
Yeah,

1003
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,340
hopefully make an audio or
something, yeah, yeah.

1004
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,960
Good to see you. Yeah,

1005
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,980
continuously embarrassed now i.

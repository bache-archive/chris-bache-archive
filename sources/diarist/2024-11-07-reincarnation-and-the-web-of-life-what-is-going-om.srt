00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,200
Welcome to what is going on for
new thought from the edge of ohm

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,940
each week on ohm times, flagship
radio show, veteran broadcaster,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,160
author and media consultant
Sandy sedgbeer conducts thought

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,760
provoking interviews with
inspirational authors, artists,

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,380
musicians, scientists, speakers
and filmmakers who are working

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,220
at the point where spirituality
and science meet consciousness

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,020
at the very edge of OM here is
your host, Sandy sedgbeer,

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,440
Sandy Sedgbeer: hello and
welcome. Today, we're going to

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,120
be talking about life after
death, Heaven and Hell and

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
reincarnation. Christopher Bache
is professor emeritus in the

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,980
Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at Youngstown

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,600
State University, adjunct
faculty at the California

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,160
Institute of integral studies,
Emeritus fellow at the Institute

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,600
of Noetic Sciences, and he's on
the Advisory Council of Grof

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,840
legacy training, an award
winning teacher and

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,100
international speaker. He is the
author of four books, including

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,580
one that I rate as one of my
favorite of all time, LSD and

19
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,180
the mind of the universe,
diamonds from heaven, which

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,780
chronicles his 20 year
psychedelic journey exploring

21
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,780
consciousness. And the other
book which we're going to be

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,480
discussing today is life cycles,
reincarnation and the web of

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,180
life, which combines scientist
testimonies about reincarnation

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,500
with the synthesis of findings
from consciousness research and

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,800
near death studies. Christopher
Bache, welcome back to the show.

26
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,679
Chris Bache: Hi Sandy. It's a
pleasure to be with you today.

27
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,520
Sandy Sedgbeer: You too. So life
cycles has been hailed as the

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,940
first book to both describe the
dynamics of rebirth and explore

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,680
the ramifications of adopting a
reincarnationist perspective.

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,400
Now, this was published, what,
35

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,060
Chris Bache: years ago? There
abouts Yeah, so that

32
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,780
Sandy Sedgbeer: was right after
you had started your journey

33
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,640
with LSD. How many years into
that journey, and how did that

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,500
journey inspire this?

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,680
Chris Bache: Well, I started my
psychedelic work the after one

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,180
year, my first year of being an
academic, and I worked for four

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,260
years, and then I stopped for
six years, and during that six

38
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,100
year interval, I did three years
of past life therapy, uncovering

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,600
and working with my own former
lives, and I wrote life cycles.

40
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,820
So my psychedelic work, by that
time, had reached deeply enough

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,100
that I had been given many
personal insights into karma,

42
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,020
the deeper cause and effect that
underlies our lives. But at that

43
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,020
time, I had not had personal
experiences of my former lives

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,280
in a psychedelic context. I had
in a hypnotherapy context, but

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,600
not a psychedelic context, but
it really was my study of Ian

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,200
Stevenson and then later, other
pioneers in the research

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,020
documenting children and adults
with validated, verified past

48
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,120
lives, memories that really
became the foundation for my

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,580
work and life cycles. Yeah.

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,660
Sandy Sedgbeer: I mean, you
shared a few of those stories,

51
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,260
which I have, you know, read
before, and they're absolutely

52
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,680
fascinating, because the whole
circumstance is there's just so

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,820
much evidence there that, you
know, you really can't question

54
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,100
it. One of them that really
interested me was the child who

55
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,980
you mentioned, Dr Helen Wambach,
who had a patient, a five year

56
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,360
old girl who rejected human
contact and withdrew into

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,980
childhood autism, but somehow
she demonstrated mathematical

58
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,360
and reading skills which she had
not been taught, but she would

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,860
not communicate. But then, over
the period of their work

60
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,520
together, she showed Dr Wambach
that how she felt, what she was

61
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,920
feeling by force feeding her
with, you know, a baby bottle,

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,840
because she felt totally,
totally, you know, like she was

63
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,420
being treated like a helpless
infant, yeah, and when and when

64
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,560
the doctor, you know, understood
that, then the child started

65
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,240
coming into herself, yeah, but
she lost the reading and she

66
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,960
lost the mathematics. I mean,
stories like that are just, you

67
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,000
know, what do you make of them?

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,120
Chris Bache: Well, what I make
of. Them is that life is much

69
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,600
long, our lives, our personal
lives, let's say our individual

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,800
lives are much longer than we
presently. Tend to think that

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,700
they are and that they're always
beginning and starting, and

72
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,480
there are overlaps. And once you
understand the larger life of

73
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,960
the soul, then this kind of
continuity of qualities,

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,380
knowledge, learning, attitudes,
traumas, of virtues that are

75
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,340
kind of blending from one life
into the start of another life,

76
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,120
where we pick up and continue to
the learning. I'm making it over

77
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,820
simple, overly linear and overly
simple, but that basic idea that

78
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,440
there is a blending, we don't
start our lives a tabula rasa.

79
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,320
We don't start our lives blank.
We start our lives with a

80
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,660
history which is a specific
history, which we can see very

81
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,620
clearly when we begin to look at
children with fresh eyes.

82
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,860
Sandy Sedgbeer: Why is it the
last? It's always the last life,

83
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,960
you know that they seem to talk

84
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,320
Chris Bache: about? Well, it's
not always the left last life.

85
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,340
Actually, in the literature,
Stevenson's research focuses on

86
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,420
children who have an active
recall of their most immediate

87
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,220
former life, their last life.
But remember, the Stevenson's

88
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,560
research is addressing a very
unusual population, children who

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,340
have spontaneous memories of
their former lives. Most people

90
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,880
do not have spontaneous memories
of their farmer lives. His

91
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,060
children are reincarnating very
quickly compared to the

92
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,160
population at large, only an
average of two and a half years

93
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,180
and very close to their life
circumstance of their previous

94
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,000
life, 50 years. Studies which
look at larger people, larger

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,600
populations of people who don't
have spontaneous recall,

96
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,480
indicate a longer time frame
between lifetimes and a much

97
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,480
broader geographical radius. So
it's, it's, so it's, it's, that

98
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,740
is a little bit of a distortion
from the research protocol. When

99
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,020
we look at therapy, people come
to the therapeutic literature.

100
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,240
People come to therapy because
of pain, and sometimes this pain

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,660
is grounded in something that
happened to them in their recent

102
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,760
past, their recent incarnational
past, but not always. Sometimes

103
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,840
it comes from several lifetimes
before. So the way I think of it

104
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,740
is our former lives are like a
deck of playing cards. We may

105
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,080
have had 52 lives, but only a
handful of those cards are

106
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,540
active in this present life, and
those, let's say five cards,

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,980
come from different centuries
and only weave together certain

108
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,200
elements of those five lives
into the composite that makes up

109
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,660
the present life. So when we,
when we kind of develop a more

110
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,040
textured understanding. We begin
to understand that it's not a

111
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,000
linear development from life to
lifetime, is that we go back to

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,320
the soul. The soul holds all of
our former lives, and then the

113
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,500
soul decides which of those
former lives in which

114
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,320
combination it's going to
incarnate into as the next

115
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,400
incarnation.

116
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,340
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, you
mentioned the word soul. But in

117
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,660
the book you make, you know,
distinction between soul and

118
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,200
over soul, yeah. So what is the
difference?

119
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,760
Chris Bache: Well, and then at
the end of the book, I dissolve

120
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,380
that distinction. But the soul,
the distinction is that for

121
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,520
Westerners who are accustomed to
thinking of the soul as the

122
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,360
spiritual essence of this
present lifetime, we need a

123
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,440
larger concept of soul to
include all of our former

124
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,520
lifetimes. And for that, I use
the concept of the oversoul,

125
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,060
borrowing that term from other
other people at the end, in the

126
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,680
end of the book, I say it gets
increasingly cumbersome to

127
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,020
maintain this division. And for
me, the word the soul and I

128
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,940
usually differentiate it by
capital S. Soul with a capital S

129
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,220
is what I mean by the oversoul,
the consciousness that holds all

130
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,800
of our lifetimes. Soul with the
small s is the consciousness

131
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,280
that's integrating all my
experiences in this incarnation.

132
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:34,279
Sandy Sedgbeer: So the over soul
is what some people would call

133
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,059
the higher self, the part of
them that you know continues

134
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:38,659
forever.

135
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,500
Chris Bache: Yes, I think so.
Yeah,

136
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,740
Sandy Sedgbeer: so I was doing
some research today, and I came

137
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,940
across this article on
psychology today by Dr Alex

138
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,820
lickerman, who is a Buddhist,
but he doesn't believe in

139
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:01,200
reincarnation, but he said that
the real. Question at the heart

140
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,160
of reincarnation is not one of
evidence, but one of identity.

141
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Chris Bache: Yeah, good point. I
haven't read that article. I'd

142
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,940
be interested in seeing what he
says. Yeah, I think once you

143
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,520
move into a reincarnational
worldview, the concept of

144
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,680
identity, shifts and expands
because I accept this body and

145
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,840
my personality as my current
identity. And you know, if I

146
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,140
have deep, mystical experiences
of oneness with the universe,

147
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:42,340
that I would accept a universal
cosmic principle as my deeper

148
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,360
identity. The concept of the
soul is kind of intermediate

149
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,600
position, isn't it? Because it's
on the one hand, it's

150
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
individual, it's an IT, because
my soul and your soul are

151
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,560
different in that they reflect
different histories and they

152
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,960
have an individuated quality.
But if you ask the question,

153
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,440
what is the essence of the soul?
What is the essence of that

154
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,800
spiritual identity? Then it
comes back down to the same

155
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,760
mystical insights. The essence
of one is the essence of all.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,140
The essence is the essence of
the Divine. Some would say of

157
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,660
the cosmic intelligence, the
cosmic principle. But it is the

158
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,860
question of identities is really
quite critical. Shifting into a

159
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,560
reincarnation worldview doesn't
undermine the value or the

160
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,120
integrity of this identity, but
it recontextualizes that

161
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,680
identity within the soul's
identity, which is the meta

162
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,980
consciousness, which holds the
100,000 years, say, of identity,

163
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,740
of all of our lifetime
experiences.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,380
Sandy Sedgbeer: It's, you know,
it's very hard to believe that

165
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,360
you have a different identity,
that you are not, you know, this

166
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,120
thing that you've lived with for
so many years, it's even harder

167
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,760
to think that actually, you know
the over soul, or that essence

168
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,340
of you is infinite. It's lived
forever and it will live

169
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,640
forever. I mean, that's a hard
one to get your head around.

170
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,140
Chris Bache: Well, it's hard in
the beginning, but it gets

171
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,820
easier with practice, both
intellectual practice, but

172
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,660
particularly with experiential
practice and experiential

173
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,760
access. It's one thing to be
intellectually convinced by the

174
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,840
evidence that reincarnation is a
principle operating in life, and

175
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,220
then when you begin to look at
life through that lens, a lot of

176
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,160
things begin to make sense which
didn't make sense before, and

177
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,600
that deepens one sense of
opening to that. But when you

178
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,720
actually sort of turn within and
follow your awareness deeper

179
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:01,380
within your own consciousness,
so deep that eventually it taps

180
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,540
into levels of your own self
awareness which predates your

181
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,220
physical body, and you learn the
stories of that self awareness

182
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,180
that come from another life, and
those experiences of that former

183
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:22,460
life have a distinct quality of
being you while being other than

184
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,960
you, but you know that they are
you. And if you encounter

185
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,860
several such lives and you
dialog with them and you work

186
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,820
with them, then it kind of has
causes a dilation within your

187
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,800
not only in your thinking, but
within your heart that it

188
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,960
becomes easier to accept this
transcendent, though

189
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,300
individuated, but transcendent
dimension to your identity. It

190
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:58,300
just and eventually it becomes
it hard to think smaller than

191
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,300
that, it actually becomes hard
to take this as your only

192
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,920
identity that just

193
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,760
Sandy Sedgbeer: I'm going to ask
you some questions, some of the

194
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,360
most common questions that come
up with this subject. And you

195
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,540
know, the first one is, why do
we reincarnate?

196
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,500
Chris Bache: Well, to learn, to
grow, to become more than we

197
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,040
are. And that really kind of
gets down to the very basic

198
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,680
question, what is the purpose of
existence? If we think we don't

199
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,520
reincarnate, if we only live one
lifetime, then if there is a

200
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,000
purpose to existence, it must be
something that can be realized

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,640
within however many years we
have in one lifetime, but if we

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,680
live an open ended number of
lives, then it invites us to

203
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,140
expand our understanding of what
the universe is doing in us,

204
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,080
with us, with all that time. And
so it opens up an open ended

205
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,700
development. Possibility we now
have an understanding of the

206
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,720
universe's time frame for the
creation of galaxies and planets

207
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,600
and systems and so on, but we've
been excluded from that because

208
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,460
we haven't had a sufficiently
expansive understanding of

209
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,940
ourselves. Reincarnation invites
us to open up into an expansive

210
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,800
understanding of our individual
participation in the cosmic

211
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,840
unfolding. And so we have all
these lives in order to learn

212
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,760
more, to become more, to
actualize more. And it's not

213
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,360
simply a matter of becoming
enlightened, though that's a

214
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,580
noble gold unto itself. It's
enlightenment. Is simply a stage

215
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,020
on in an evolutionary
progression which extends far

216
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,120
beyond enlightenment. I mean, if
you just think ahead, what will

217
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,500
what could we become if we had a
million years more or billion

218
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,340
years more.

219
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,100
Sandy Sedgbeer: I only have a
problem with this because if we

220
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:12,180
are sparks of God, yeah, if we
know everything, when we leave,

221
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,240
and many people say, suddenly
they understand everything, and

222
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,720
you know, they're in a whole
other kind of it, you know,

223
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:27,140
their awareness is so expanded.
Why do we need to learn more?

224
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,920
How much more is there to learn?
Aren't we complete when we're

225
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,180
there, but then we actually, you
know, kind of regress when we

226
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,360
come here. And I don't
understand the point of that

227
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,860
Chris Bache: well, that would be
like asking to a real good

228
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,300
question, when the infinite
before creation, before

229
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,040
manifesting the physical
universe, why would the creative

230
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,560
principle manifest the physical
universe, which almost is

231
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,980
inherently less self aware, less
knowledgeable? And I think it's

232
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,500
not so much we do expand our
knowledge much, much more when

233
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,940
we are when we die. Whether it
it seems like it is infinite

234
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,880
knowledge, maybe it is, but
maybe there's even more than

235
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,240
what we think of as infinite
knowledge. But the real question

236
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,268
becomes, if God were to come to
us and say, Would you help me

237
00:17:24,268 --> 00:17:28,588
grow this universe? Would you
bring as much knowledge as you

238
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:34,468
can into your person and help me
grow this universe into a higher

239
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:39,388
form of physical manifestation
of our spiritual nature? So it's

240
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:42,160
not simply what happens to us
when we die? I think we get a

241
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,380
glimpse, we expand, we get a
contact. The question is, who

242
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,440
would turn down the invitation
to actually participate in a

243
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,180
creative process which will
produce higher and higher and

244
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,240
higher, deeper and deeper and
deeper forms of humanity, in

245
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,400
evolution, in history, so that
truly we will eventually be able

246
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,700
to make heaven on earth. We
won't simply be imprisoned and

247
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,760
dumb and stupid when we
incarnate. We will be

248
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,400
enlightened. We will be
infinitely aware in our physical

249
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,840
incarnation. I think this is the
trajectory that we're on. So

250
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,660
it's becoming more and more and
participating in the dance of

251
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,440
creation.

252
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,280
Sandy Sedgbeer: You know, I can,
I can follow that some of the

253
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,120
way I, you know, yeah, I'd be
there saying, Yeah, I'll

254
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,500
participate. But the fact is,
you know, to then come here and

255
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,900
forget everything, and to really
be living like you're starting

256
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,720
all over again, you know, all
the knowledge, all the wisdom

257
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,620
that you've gathered over all of
those years. What happens to it?

258
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Chris Bache: But we don't forget
everything, do we? Because we we

259
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,320
we may lose a fair amount of our
conscious recall, but what we

260
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,820
have known is built into our
unconscious recall, just like

261
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,880
these children, who may not
remember how they acquired that

262
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,120
mathematical knowledge or other
kinds of knowledge, but it's

263
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,000
there we not may not remember
how we develop the capacities

264
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,740
that are now natural to us, but
there is a history behind

265
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,660
everything that we are. So we
don't really forget it all. We

266
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,460
just forget some of it, but we
bring a lot of it into our very

267
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,940
being, and then we we express
that knowledge in our life and

268
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,740
we develop so that by the time
we finish, we have become more

269
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,680
we have incarnated more
completely some of that

270
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,800
knowledge than we were at the
beginning of our lifetime.

271
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,920
Sandy Sedgbeer: So many you
know, we've all seen media.

272
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:08,220
Teams who bring loved ones, you
know, how is it that if somebody

273
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,420
has passed over and they're
either in the Bardo or they're

274
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,260
reincarnated, or they've, you
know, they're doing whatever

275
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,440
they're doing, how is it that
they come back? You know, they

276
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,140
can reconnect to that identity
in that moment, to give that,

277
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,340
you know, yeah, believed loved
one, whatever message they need.

278
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,200
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, now
we're getting into the nuts and

279
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,260
bolts of the soul. It's a good
question, and I'm going to give

280
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:44,140
a short answer to a long, a long
question. Um, uh, this is an

281
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,560
ideal scenario, but a not
uncommon scenario. I think, when

282
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,140
we die, we return to the soul,
and after a transitional period

283
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,800
where we evaluate our current,
la past life, and we evaluate

284
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,200
what went right, what went
wrong, and we assimilate that

285
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,220
learning, we return to the soul,
and we begin to naturally

286
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,660
exchange what we might think of
as our small identity for our

287
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,640
large identity, our 100 Year
identity for 100,000 year

288
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,800
identity, so that Chris Bache no
longer lives Just as Chris

289
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:27,740
Bache, but is restored to the
total knowledge of my soul. Now

290
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:35,180
let's say my father died when I
was 18. Okay, so when I die, I

291
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,740
may want to see my dad, and if I
want, if I get the opportunity

292
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,980
to see my dad, whether or not
his soul has incarnated an

293
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,020
aspect of him in a subsequent
incarnation. I think it works

294
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,620
something like this, when my
being wants to meet my dad, his

295
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,920
soul comes to me, but
manifesting the front image of

296
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,980
that soul would be the being
that I had known him as, which

297
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,600
would be my father. So Chris
Bache would meet his father, but

298
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,840
soon, before too long, it would
it would be a matter of soul to

299
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,020
soul. So Chris Bache his soul
would be meeting my father's

300
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,820
soul, and we would be having a
much deeper conversation than

301
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,540
simply Chris Bache speaking to
his father. Now we're having a

302
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:35,840
cosmic conversation. Now I think
the mediums can contact people

303
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,440
who are discarded, but that we
should be careful before we

304
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,200
infer that the form in which the
medium encounters them is the

305
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,560
form in which they are truly
existing in their post death

306
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,300
state. I think a lot of our
fascination and compulsion, even

307
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,200
to communicate with those who
have died in the form in which

308
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,780
we knew them, reflects a limited
understanding of what happens to

309
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,100
us when we die, and it tends to
reflect a Western understanding

310
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,660
that when we die, we are judged,
and we go to heaven or hell or

311
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,220
purgatory or some level of the
Bardo. And it's a pretty short

312
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,860
term concept I am not
particularly interested in

313
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,040
communicating to my father as I
knew him, when there's so much

314
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,820
more could take place in our
exchange.

315
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,040
Sandy Sedgbeer: So in a sense,
you know, the the soul of the

316
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:40,240
person that comes through for
somebody is, in a way, doing

317
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,660
something with compassion, and
they're just stepping into,

318
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,240
Chris Bache: yeah, they're
wearing the wearing the

319
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,080
compassion, the presence of that
that this person had known them

320
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,820
as, and communicating to that
person through that persona. But

321
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,160
that persona isn't necessarily
who they truly are now.

322
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,980
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, another
common question is, until I read

323
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,240
this book, I didn't know how to
answer it is, well, how, you

324
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,760
know, how can there be
reincarnation? There's far more

325
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,240
people on the planet now than
there were, you know, 1000 years

326
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,120
ago, yeah, yeah.

327
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,480
Chris Bache: Well, you know,
I'll answer with an analogy.

328
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,740
Start there. If you were at a
university, and the university

329
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,760
had 6000 students, and you never
left campus. You lived on

330
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,420
campus, and there was a rhythm.
Every semester there were fewer

331
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,900
people, they went home, and then
every semester they came back.

332
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,400
But over a few years, you would
notice that the population of

333
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,180
the campus is getting bigger.
And you might wonder where all

334
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,960
these extra people coming from?
But of course, they're coming

335
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,800
from a town outside of campus,
which is a much, much larger

336
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,600
town than the number of people
on campus. And I think it's like

337
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,660
that in the. Three incarnation,
we have no reason for believing

338
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,440
that the number of souls
available to incarnate is

339
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,900
finite, or that it's small and
that all of them were present at

340
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,860
some early point in Earth's
evolutionary history, and

341
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,720
therefore we have to explain
where all the extra souls are

342
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,000
coming from. Perhaps there are
billions of souls in line

343
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:31,100
waiting to take up positions as
positions become available in

344
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,460
the earth school. We have no
reason for believing that the

345
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,720
number of souls is finite, or
that they were all present on

346
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,920
earth in the beginning. So we
just have to, well, the

347
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,020
invitation here is to open up to
understanding that the spiritual

348
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,760
universe is many, many times
larger than the physical

349
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,660
universe. Robert Monroe is
working out of body work in the

350
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,280
Monroe Institute emphasizes over
and over the physical universe

351
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:08,280
is a small slice of reality.
Most of reality is spiritual,

352
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,600
Sandy Sedgbeer: but wasn't it?
Robert Monroe, who also said

353
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,160
that some humans involved
evolved from higher animals.

354
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,980
Chris Bache: Yeah, actually,
that's the that is the common

355
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,640
view of most reincarnation
societies. That is, if we look,

356
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,480
if we follow the line back and
ask, where does reincarnation

357
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,440
begin, they generally think that
it doesn't begin with human

358
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,120
consciousness. It begins farther
back in our animal pedigree. So

359
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,480
reincarnation seems to be a
dynamic that is correlated with

360
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,460
the birth of individuality
grass. Hard to see grass as

361
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,620
individual, but sooner or later,
we have individuated

362
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,840
consciousness emerging within
the animal kingdom.

363
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,540
Reincarnation seems to be a
function of that individuated

364
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,920
consciousness, exploring and
empowering and expanding itself,

365
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,580
and that starts before human
beings.

366
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,820
Sandy Sedgbeer: Now we're
actually getting, I think it's

367
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,480
Dr Linda Brackman, who does past
life regression, who was trained

368
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,020
with Michael Newton, and he told
her that the time would come

369
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,640
when many people's the lives
they accessed were not lived on

370
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,360
this planet. And that's actually
happening. She said, I mean, her

371
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,320
books are full of stories of,
you know, people's experiences

372
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,300
that they connect with previous
life somewhere else entirely.

373
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,620
Chris Bache: Well, we'd have to
ask, at least on a theoretical

374
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,760
level, why not if we just look
up at the universe and look

375
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,480
through the Hubble telescope and
all wonderful images that are

376
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,720
coming to us, and we see life
burgeoning and stars and

377
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,940
planets, why shouldn't there be
evolved life on those forms? And

378
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,800
if reincarnation is possible,
then why should it be only be

379
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,360
restricted to one star system?
Why might not there be some type

380
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,900
of interplanetary crossovers? I
don't have any personal

381
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,060
experience of that myself, but I
know that she does, and so I

382
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,380
think, well, that's interesting.

383
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,960
Sandy Sedgbeer: It is
interesting. It is. We're going

384
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,600
to take a short break now.
You're listening to what is

385
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,840
going on. I'm Sandy sedgby, and
my guest today is professor

Philosophy and Religious Studies

at young town State University,
and I won't read the rest of

388
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,880
what you do other than you're an
international speaker, a teacher

389
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,420
and an author, Christopher
Bache, and we're discussing the

390
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,380
compelling research and the
tantalizing questions raised in

391
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,040
his book, life cycles,
reincarnation and the web of

392
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,160
life still to come. What happens
to those identities that we once

393
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,360
thought were us. Why was
reincarnation removed from the

394
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,220
scriptures? Why is our time
between lives as important to

395
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,240
our development as our earthly
phase and more? Stay tuned.

Open yourself to the

possibilities.

428
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,340
Everything that we do, we can do
in a contemplative manner.

429
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,100
Through the art of
contemplation, you can use the

430
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,600
gene keys in a really powerful
way. Gene keys is basically the

431
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,580
Code Book of Life in the gene
keys, the book is made up of

432
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,760
these three levels, shadows,
gifts and cities. And the

433
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,140
journey is from is through those
three levels, kind of unpicking

434
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,860
of the shadow states, the
releasing of the gifts and then

435
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,920
the embodying of this higher
consciousness called the city.

436
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,140
And the cities are very exalted
words, and it's not like we kind

437
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,340
of suddenly are all these
exalted Christ like beings, but

438
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,000
we have flashes and
illuminations along the journey,

439
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,600
and the more we get stuck into
the journey, the more

440
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,080
illumination comes to us,
because the more we're releasing

441
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,300
the light from in these codes
inside our DNA. So all those

442
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,980
revelations are inside us. So
the contemplative way is the

443
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,700
inner way.

444
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,800
There are 16 million children
struggling with hunger in

445
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,180
America. That's one in five
daughters, sons, neighbors and

446
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,120
classmates who don't know where
their next meal is coming from,

447
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,480
yet, billions of pounds of good
food go to waste every year.

448
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,540
It's time we do something about
it. Feeding America is a

449
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,240
nationwide network of food banks
that helps provide meals to

450
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,540
millions of kids and families in
need. Visit feedingamerica.org

451
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,800
to help them feed even more
together, we can solve hunger

452
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
together. We're Feeding America.

453
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,960
Sandy Sedgbeer: Welcome back.
Christopher Bache, so I'm rather

454
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,380
attached to this, you know,
person, personality, the thought

455
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,720
that it might disappear at some
point, you know, like an actor

456
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,380
just shedding a role that
they've played, take off the

457
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,580
costume and never to be seen or
heard from again, you know,

458
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,880
Chris Bache: never to be heard
and seen from again.

459
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,080
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, in that
form, oh, in that form, well, in

460
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,600
that form, you know, it's, I
don't like that idea. I mean,

461
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,900
I'd like to know that, you know,
maybe I could connect with her

462
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,040
sometime. Maybe I could even
bring her back, yeah, and be

463
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,280
that character again. Do you
think any of that is possible?

464
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,480
Chris Bache: Well, I think the
the the essence and the system

465
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,760
of our lives is preserved
beautifully intact when we die,

466
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:08,220
we take with us not only all of
our memories, but we take with

467
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,460
us a living and vivid version of
the experiences that we had on

468
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,600
Earth in Technicolor and stereo
as the near death episode

469
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,060
experiences have shown us when
they have when they relive their

470
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,600
life, they relive it in much,
much more detail than they were

471
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:32,300
ever remember having it in the
first place. So not only do we

472
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,040
continue perfectly intact, but
we continue in this super

473
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,740
saturated version of ourselves.
And all of that is taken

474
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,660
forward, all of that is brought
into the soul. And the soul can

475
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,380
crystallize its larger
consciousness in any of its

476
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,220
forms, or it can actualize all
of their integrated

477
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:59,740
consciousness into a singular,
integrated form, and in the end,

478
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:06,480
a. I'm only willing to give
this, this 100 years, if that

479
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,520
you know, it's just, it's just
too limited. I mean, why ride a

480
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,380
bicycle when you can have a
spaceship? Just, it's so much.

481
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,600
So there's no sense of
sacrifice. I think there's,

482
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,820
there's a sense maybe, of
trading up.

483
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,720
Sandy Sedgbeer: You know,
sometimes I think that I'm, I'm

484
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:34,220
not very um, elevated in my
consciousness, you know. And if

485
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,180
I have been alive for millennia,
then I'm really not doing a very

486
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,540
good job, you know, after all of
that time, that I'd be further

487
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:49,060
on. You know, I tend to look at
things like people or beings,

488
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:55,060
like spirit guides and angels
and ascended masters as they

489
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,840
were once, you know, just as
human as me, enjoyed a human

490
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,840
life, perhaps, and have reached
such an elevated state. I mean,

491
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,560
is it conceivable that I could
be one of them one day?

492
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,880
Chris Bache: Well, yes, of
course, it's conceivable,

493
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,420
because your essential nature
already is one of those beings.

494
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,680
But let me just kind of flip
this a little bit at first. I

495
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,420
just, I've been teaching this
stuff for years, and I had just

496
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,180
generations and generations of
students come through my

497
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,200
courses. And one of the things
I've learned is you can't judge

498
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,860
you can't read a book by looking
at the cover. You can't judge a

499
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,680
person's soul development by
looking at what they're dealing

500
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,080
with. And it's kind of like at a
university, somebody can have

501
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,980
developed a great deal of
expertise in music, for example,

502
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,180
but then they decide to start
developing an expertise in their

503
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,380
art. And so they let go of their
expertise in music in order to

504
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,340
start a whole new course regimen
in art. And if you were to look

505
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,480
at only what they do in art, you
might think, oh, this person is

506
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,960
a freshman, when really they're
very sophisticated senior with

507
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,440
all these other skills. And I
think it's also that way for the

508
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,940
soul too. So I mean, I mean,
look at what you do. You're an

509
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,080
enormous influencer. You're
you're hosting one spiritual

510
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,900
dialog after another. You you're
touching 1000s and 1000s of

511
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,060
people's lives. What, how could
your soul, if your soul were in

512
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,980
the Bardo, say, in a pre
incarnated state, and you were

513
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:36,260
given the opportunity to bring
down some sense of what, you

514
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:42,760
know, some aspiration, some
capacity and enthusiasm for

515
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,420
exploring spiritual knowledge,
but not by yourself in a

516
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,620
monastic context, but in a
platform that reaches out into

517
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:55,120
the world at a time in history
when the world needs this type

518
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,160
of knowledge. So my basic sense
is, Don't sell yourself short. I

519
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,420
mean, I think there are many
more Bodhisattvas in the world

520
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,740
than we think.

521
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,160
Sandy Sedgbeer: Um, yeah, I'm
sure you're right. Okay, so

522
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,080
another question, white light,
several spiritual teachers are

523
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,040
of the opinion that we should
not go towards the light, as we

524
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,660
will be trapped in cycles of
reincarnation. They say, they

525
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,740
say you can bypass that and go
somewhere else. What do you

526
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,640
think of that one?

527
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,480
Chris Bache: Well, it doesn't
make any sense to me. It doesn't

528
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,580
compute for me. To me, the white
light, just at a simple level,

529
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,180
when we separate from our body,
the white light is our homing

530
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,300
beacon, taking us back home,
taking us back to the our

531
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,380
essential nature, our deeper
spirit, our deeper divine

532
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:52,720
nature. Now the basic classic
idea is people instinctively

533
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,940
move towards the light, and they
move as far towards the light as

534
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,040
they feel comfortable, and at
some point to one along the way,

535
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,840
for various reasons, people feel
less comfortable, or they feel

536
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,220
sort of it's more natural just
to stop and drop a drop off, and

537
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:15,180
that that they're at that level
of spiritual development, that

538
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,440
they feel most comfortable in
the 1000s and 1000s of levels of

539
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,280
the Bardo and so the the
admission, the admonition for

540
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:30,440
and from that level they will
eventually go through a process

541
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,080
in which they will make the
choice to incarnate again, the

542
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,740
admit, admonition in Most
spiritual traditions is to do a

543
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,220
kind of training that allows you
to be comfortable with the

544
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,200
light, so that you can follow
the light all the way home, all

545
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,560
the way through all the levels
of the Bardo, all the way to the

546
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,660
most intense form of that light,
which resides within what the

547
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,600
Buddhists call Extra. Samsara
reality, so a reality which is

548
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,400
outside the entire reincarnating
universe altogether. So to me,

549
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,940
whether our journey into the
light takes us back to our own

550
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,540
natural level of peak spiritual
realization, or whether it takes

551
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,980
us all the way back beyond all
those intermediate levels to the

552
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:31,940
highest level. It doesn't make
any much difference to me. It

553
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,080
makes most sense to follow the
light all the way as far as you

554
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,560
can.

555
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,900
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah. Well,
you've seen that, haven't you?

556
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,080
Chris Bache: I have, and it
touched me in a way that has

557
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,780
affected the entire rest of my
life.

558
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:56,260
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, so why was
reincarnation taken out of

559
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,840
Christianity? I mean, for the
first 500 years of Christianity,

560
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,400
it was a vital commitment, and
then Justin Ian removed it.

561
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,900
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, that's
a complex story. And that I was

562
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,200
first an historian of early
Christianity, that was my first

563
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,440
academic love in the search for
the historical Jesus. Was my

564
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,860
first I did my masters at
Cambridge in the search for the

565
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:25,340
historical Jesus, and it's it's
a complex process, and I don't

566
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:32,540
think the definitive story has
yet been written. Did Jesus

567
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,560
teach reincarnation? It
certainly is present in some of

568
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,780
the Gnostic Gospels. But do
those Gnostic Gospels reflect

569
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,100
the actual teaching of the
historical Jesus, and if Jesus

570
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,960
did teach reincarnation, then we
have to explain why it was

571
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:56,200
filtered out. Or if he did teach
reincarnation, why isn't it more

572
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:01,260
thoroughly saturating the
earliest level of the scriptural

573
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,040
tradition. However we answer
those, and we don't have the

574
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,060
time to answer those today, it
clearly is the case that there

575
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,600
were multiple variations of
Christianity in the early

576
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,740
centuries, and some of those
variations taught reincarnation,

577
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,560
and they also taught the
empowerment of women, that women

578
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,160
should have clerical capacities
and responsibilities, so on, so

579
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,580
forth. And both of those
elements were filtered out of

580
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:34,340
the tradition. It is Geddes
McGregor, who is a Christian.

581
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,520
Was Christian theologian. Wrote
numerous books on early

582
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,500
Christian thought around
reincarnation. He was of, he's

583
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:46,420
of the opinion that there is
nothing inherently contradictory

584
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,020
to the belief in reincarnation
and the teachings of the

585
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,580
essential Jesus, kind of the or
early, early core teachings of

586
00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:00,180
Jesus. But it it gives an
individual too much autonomy for

587
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,160
their spiritual welfare. In the
historical context of the

588
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,120
collapse of the Roman Empire,
the emergence of the Catholic of

589
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,640
highly centralized authority,
the church saw this highly

590
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,860
centralized network of priests,
bishops, Cardinals, the Pope, as

591
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:24,980
essential to the salvation of
the salvation of the church, and

592
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,300
therefore to all whom the church
served. So I would give them the

593
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,540
benefit of the doubt and say
that they thought they were

594
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,580
doing a good thing by really
creating this system that made

595
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,940
individuals contingent upon the
intermediate clear clergy and

596
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,260
the authority of the Church now,
from a reincarnation

597
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,280
perspective, they didn't do a
good thing. It took us a long

598
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,340
time to uncover this deeper
teaching that where each one of

599
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:03,000
us is responsible for our
relationship with the divine.

600
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,520
The Church may help us, but the
end, in the end, the church is

601
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,200
not essential to the maturing of
our relationship to the divine.

602
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,900
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, I have
another question about that. I

603
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,700
mean you, you devoted, you know,
chapter six to the question of

604
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,640
whether there's room for
reincarnation in Christian

605
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,320
thought, yeah, 35 years ago, you
know, I'd like to know in a

606
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,160
minute if your view on that has
changed. But before we do that,

607
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,340
I want to make sure we get this
one in talk about the hidden

608
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:43,180
phase of life, the time between
lives, which you say is just as

609
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,980
important to our development,

610
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,060
Chris Bache: yeah, and that's
actually why I named the book

611
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,880
life cycles. I wish I had named
it a little bit differently,

612
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:58,240
because it became acutely
significant to me that if you

613
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,340
look at the cycle of life as
only. Taking place between birth

614
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,960
and death. You're missing half
of the cycle. We miss what

615
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,020
happens between death and birth.
And you have to look at the

616
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:16,080
whole cycle to understand the
rhythm of the soul, the rhythm

617
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,080
of human consciousness. And so
there are, just as there are

618
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,280
kind of standardized gradations
of what happens when a child is

619
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,300
born there, there's a
standardized process of what

620
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,840
happens when we die. And I think
Michael Newton's work is the

621
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,180
some of the best work I've seen,
explaining what happens in the

622
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,240
minutes, hours, years, relative,
you know, using time in a non

623
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,540
time universe after we die, the
integration, the introspection,

624
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,860
the review of our most recent
life, looking at it deeply from

625
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,600
within a spiritual perspective,
looking at our relationships and

626
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,520
Our challenges and from a
relation, from a deeper

627
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,240
spiritual perspective,
integrating all of our successes

628
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,040
and failures, really
internalizing them, entering

629
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,340
into the civilization of
spiritual beings in this

630
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,720
civilization and In the
community of fellow Soul

631
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:29,360
Travelers in enjoying the the
recess, the the return to a more

632
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:35,660
complete spiritual awareness of
existence, and then in time, a

633
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:41,080
gradual focusing into the next
challenge that we set for

634
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,560
ourselves, because it's like a
university. You finish a

635
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,600
semester, you take your exams,
you digest and rest for a bit,

636
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,800
but you make then choices for
what you're going to take next

637
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,360
semester. And mutant mutant
shows that these choices are

638
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:05,160
done not by ourselves, but under
the guidance and tutelage of our

639
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,260
guides, our Senior kind of more
senior spiritual beings, till

640
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,280
and we have some insight into
the lives that we're choosing,

641
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,680
we have options, and we we make
a choice that this particular

642
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,200
set of challenges suits my
particular needs where I am in

643
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,520
my development, or it gives me
an opportunity to be of service

644
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,260
in ways that I haven't
experienced before. And then we

645
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:38,420
make those choices, and then
we've engaged the incarnational

646
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,980
process, and we wake up kicking
and screaming as a newborn

647
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,840
child. If you understand the
whole of the cycle, then you

648
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,280
have a much the beginnings of a
much deeper understanding of

649
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,960
what makes life tick in a human
psyche than if you only pay

650
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,300
attention from birth to death.

651
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,400
Sandy Sedgbeer: So I was doing
some research on statistics, and

652
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,760
I discovered that it seems, you
know, very obviously rough

653
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:19,680
numbers, but something like over
57% of people in the world

654
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,640
believe in life after death,
between 12 and 44% depending on

655
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,080
you know, which country you're
looking at, believe in

656
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:38,300
reincarnation. 75% believe in
heaven and hell. You know, which

657
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,040
makes me wonder, because if you
know, only 57 believe in life

658
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,420
after death. Where's that extra
where do they think heaven and

659
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,380
hell is? I don't know. Yeah.
What do you have to say about

660
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:55,840
Chris Bache: heaven and hell?
And 25% of American Protestants

661
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,800
and about the same percentage of
American Catholics believe in

662
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,240
reincarnation. That's the one of
the statistics that that really

663
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,380
blows my mind, Heaven and Hell.
You know, I think in some ways,

664
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,940
the Buddhists get closest to it,
and their basic vision of is,

665
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,980
when we die, we enter in a
universe, a stage of our life

666
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:22,100
where what we are is mirrored
back to us in our in our

667
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,940
experience. So if we've done
good in life, if we've been

668
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,300
generous and kind and
thoughtful, then that is

669
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,780
mirrored back to us in the
experience of heaven or the

670
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,760
heavenly beings. If we've done
harm and injury and selfish and

671
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,500
stingy things and hurt people,
then that is simply mirrored

672
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,400
back to us, not out of
punishment, but to educate us.

673
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,300
And this is the experience of
hell. So from this perspective,

674
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,720
hell is the experience of our
shortcomings, heaven is the

675
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:59,620
experience of our joys. And I
think that works and Newton his

676
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,360
cause. Cosmology seems to
integrate that, but this is

677
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,000
would be mistakenly and could be
mistakenly interpreted as a

678
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,700
cosmological absolute, when
really it's simply a stage in

679
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:21,440
our debriefing. It's a stage
that we go through. I think the

680
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,300
deeper reality is that there is
a heaven of heavens. There is a

681
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,040
heaven beyond the heaven of our
feedback to our own goodness.

682
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:37,280
There is a heaven of heavens, a
reality of infinite love,

683
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,920
infinite knowledge, infinite
bliss, within which the entire

684
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,700
human evolutionary saga is just
a small piece and should not be

685
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:54,460
taken as defining the limits of
the universe. Is there,

686
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:59,080
similarly, a hell of hells? Is
there an eternal hell? And I

687
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:03,000
absolutely do not believe there
is it has not been so in my

688
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,980
experience at all, that is
simply a theological mistake, a

689
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:13,200
mistaken interpretation. Now, I
think there is accountability.

690
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,520
There is we are responsible for
the actions that we take, and

691
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,020
there is an accountability.
Nobody gets out scot free. But

692
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,460
that accountability does not
include this loathsome idea of

693
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,440
eternal damnation or eternal
punishment. No mother or father

694
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,700
would do that to their child for
making mistakes, and likewise,

695
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,600
the supreme intelligence of the
universe would not do that to

696
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,600
human beings. Now, having said
that, let me step into something

697
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,400
different, as you know, from my
book, you know, LSD, in the mind

698
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,580
of the universe, I have entered
and spent many years and days in

699
00:51:54,580 --> 00:52:00,300
hell realms, in experiencing
extreme torture of that looks

700
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,740
like a hell realm, and my
understanding, eventually of

701
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:10,200
this is this, just as my
individual psyche retains all my

702
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,400
individual memories, both good
ones and traumatic ones, there

703
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:20,040
is a consciousness of the human
species which retains all of its

704
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:24,980
memories and processes, all of
those memories in a central

705
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,600
medicine psychological
condition, what Jung called the

706
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,860
collective un psych unconscious.
And that means all the terrible

707
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,560
things that human beings have
done to each other, all the

708
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,900
wars, all the horrors and all
the injustices and all the rapes

709
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,740
and the pillaging, to the extent
that those have not been

710
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:50,620
clarified or healed or removed,
they become part of the

711
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:55,060
collective torment, the
collective shadow of humanity.

712
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,100
So you might say that within the
human psyche, there are clusters

713
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:06,960
of memories that have a hellish
quality. But that doesn't mean

714
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:13,140
that there is a cosmological
state of being of hell, because

715
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:18,420
just as individuals have bad
experiences that they can then

716
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:23,180
clear from their system, the
human species can have terrible

717
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,900
trauma, which it is in the
process of clearing from its

718
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:33,080
system. Okay, and I think that
in the early church, maybe some

719
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,940
of the people who had contact
with these collective hellish

720
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:44,140
realms mistakenly interpreted
them to as a cosmological

721
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,640
principle of eternal hell.

722
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,860
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, just we've
got about four minutes left less

723
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,220
than that quickly. Go back to
this question whether there is

724
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,820
room for reincarnation in
Christian thought. You say that

725
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,600
it would only take a small

726
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,400
Chris Bache: Yeah, I think, of
course, traditional Christianity

727
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,980
would say, No, there's no room
for it whatsoever. One life,

728
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,000
eternal hell. But I think there
are many Christianity has

729
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,120
committed itself that if
anything can be demonstrated as

730
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,960
a fact, then we'll find out how
it works, and work it into

731
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,940
Christian theology. And if
reincarnation is demonstrated as

732
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,300
a fact, which I think it has
been and is being, then

733
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,720
Christianity will find out how
to how it works and how it

734
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:34,880
makes, how to make room for it.
All we have to do incorporate

735
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,520
reincarnation within a Christian
framework is expand the notion

736
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,820
of the age of the soul. We can
even give Jesus a unique role in

737
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:50,500
salvation history. If we want
to, we may choose to expand to

738
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,940
see Jesus as part of a whole
brotherhood and sisterhood of

739
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,840
awakened beings helping
humanity. But even if we wanted

740
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:04,500
to make Jesus the. Unique savior
of Christianity. All we have to

741
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:09,720
do is open up the notion that
the journey of the soul is a

742
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,980
journey of maturation that takes
place over many lifetimes. It's

743
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,240
not finished in one lifetime,
and all of a sudden the

744
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,820
inadequacies that have been
foisted on Christianity by this

745
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:27,020
terribly short sighted
assumption that we only have one

746
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:32,240
lifetime. So if you only live
six days and you die, there's a

747
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,380
consequence to that. Or if you
are a bad person, or you do

748
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,740
something bad in the first 10
years of your life, you could go

749
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,100
to hell for the rest of your
life, these terrible

750
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,940
consequences, the kindness of
the universe, the compassion of

751
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:51,040
Jesus, has much more room to
grow in a world which

752
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:55,120
understands that he's talking to
souls. He's not simply talking

753
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:59,440
to personalities. He's talking
to souls in his teaching.

754
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,020
Sandy Sedgbeer: Last question,
very quickly. You end the book

755
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,220
by talking about the web of
life, understanding the rhythms

756
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,460
about life as an ongoing dialog,
which is you've kind of covered

757
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:14,220
in what you've just said, more
or less. Is there anything that

758
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,360
you want to add to that

759
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,720
Chris Bache: I've lived in the
reincarnational worldview so

760
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,220
long, and I've taught it and
talked with people and listened

761
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,360
to their stories and processes
people's life experience that it

762
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,160
is so natural to me to
understand the uniqueness of

763
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,420
every soul and the uniqueness of
every incarnation and the

764
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:46,180
complex background web between
lives and circumstances that to

765
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:50,260
see life in the old way, what I
used to see it in this kind of

766
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,760
silo way, is completely
unnatural, intellectually and

767
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,020
spiritually untenable and
spiritually unnourishing. So to

768
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,660
me, reincarnation doesn't answer
all our questions, but it is the

769
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,960
beginning of deeper and deeper
and deeper questions and deeper

770
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:13,020
answers which brings a true
richness and deep satisfaction

771
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:20,060
to the life process. It takes
out this terrible horror of a

772
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,140
good God,

773
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,440
Sandy Sedgbeer: I'm gonna have
to cut you there. It looks like

774
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,760
we've gone over time. I'm so
sorry, but that's okay. What can

775
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,200
I say? You know, talking to you
is always fascinating. Thank you

776
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,820
so much for joining us today.
Thank you Sandy. So life cycles,

777
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,840
reincarnation and the web of
life is still available in

778
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,320
paperback format. And for more

time next week with another what

782
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,840
is going on till then, it's
goodbye from me and thank you

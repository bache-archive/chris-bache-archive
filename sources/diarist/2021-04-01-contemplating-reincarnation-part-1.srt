Unknown: Foreign

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,460
Richard Rudd: welcome everyone
to a series of talks that I'm

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,180
doing here with my friend Chris
Bache, and we're going to be

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,800
discussing a subject that we're
both really interested in and

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,620
fascinated by, which is rebirth
and all the things that go along

6
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,340
with rebirth. Might also call it
reincarnation, because that's

7
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:47,080
part of the story. And this
began really because I read

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,700
Chris, a book by Chris, a
wonderful book called LSD and

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,440
the mind of the universe and and
what it did is it kind of just

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,940
triggered a real recognition in
me. And since I'm a teacher of

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,720
spiritual matters and I'm the
founder of a system called the

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,520
gene keys, that resonance that
went off in me, it caused me to

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,180
reach out via email to this
amazing man, and you never know

14
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,140
whether you're going to hear
back from in those instances.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,940
And Chris, very kindly, got back
to me, and we started a series

16
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,200
of dialogs and discussions, and
we realized that we we really

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,220
enjoyed having dialogs together,
so that's why we're here, and

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,060
we're going to explore this
subject in several sessions. So

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,940
today we're going to just begin
with some introductory concepts

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,700
and basics and and then see
where it leaves us. So I hope

21
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,440
you enjoy it, and I'm very much
looking forward to it.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,500
Chris Bache: So we're
anticipating three discussions

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,200
Richard Rudd: Absolutely. So
Chris, if you want to say a few

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,940
things about yourself, just so
that, yeah, people know who you

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,060
are.

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,820
Chris Bache: It's a pleasure to
be here, and I've enjoyed our

27
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,720
conversations that we've had
prior to this and this, our this

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,480
present dialog grew out of those
earlier conversations. I am a

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,240
Professor of Philosophy and
Religious Studies. I'm on the

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,140
religious studies side of the
shop. I'm retired from

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,180
Youngstown State University. In
the course of my teaching, I've

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,660
taught courses on world
religions and Eastern religions

33
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,840
and Transpersonal psychology of
religion and comparative

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,460
mysticism, Buddhism. So I've
been teaching in areas touching

35
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,040
on reincarnation for many years.
I've written several books. My

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,760
first one was on reincarnation,
starting with the scientific

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,340
evidence for reincarnation,
which we'll be touching on

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,080
today, and it's been seminal in
my thinking. And I just believe

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,620
that reincarnation is one of
those concepts that is like

40
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,440
plate tectonics. If you at first
it's hard to see because it's

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,220
not obvious, but once you see
it, it changes everything. It

42
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,940
changes so much, it opens up the
horizon of existence. So we

43
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,060
thought this would be a good
topic to have a shared

44
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,120
conversation about. And I'm just
a real pleased to be here.

45
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:16,860
Great.

46
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,219
Richard Rudd: Thanks, Chris. And
I mean, we'll put the link in

47
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,659
afterwards, but there's some
great things talks that you've

48
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:27,319
done, and particularly one which
I watched fairly recently about

49
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,039
is there evidence for
reincarnation, and it's so

50
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:37,879
illuminating and extraordinary
and kind of overlooked by so

51
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:42,939
many people. Tell us some of the
you know your story, in

52
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:46,779
assembling and amassing that
some of that evidence or meeting

53
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:47,979
the other people that have,

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,660
Chris Bache: well, you know, I
came from a traditional

55
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,080
religious background, but over
the course of many years of

56
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,540
graduate education, I finished
My doctoral work in philosophy

57
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,620
of religion as an atheistically
inclined agnostic. And basically

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,000
I had studied my way out of
religion altogether. So I

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,960
started my academic career as a
young man a long time ago, in

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,540
1978 and I met there the work of
two people in my first year, and

61
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,980
both of them changed the course
of my life. The first was Ian

62
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,460
Stevenson, the Carlson professor
at the University of Virginia,

63
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,380
whose lifelong work has been to
provide carefully documented

64
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,940
cases that clearly of young
children, small children, who

65
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,020
have spontaneous memories of
their previous life, and then

66
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,980
researching these children from
all over the world, collecting

67
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,760
1000s of cases, publishing
hundreds of cases, and he

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,300
convinced me that reincarnation
was a simple fact of life.

69
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,660
Richard Rudd: Well, that's quite
a book, isn't it? That's a big

70
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,560
book he's written.

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,080
Chris Bache: The book he's
written about, oh, I think close

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,540
to a dozen now, but this first
one was called 20 cases

73
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,980
suggestive of reincarnation.
Reincarnation, and to me, it was

74
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,580
a life pivot, because
reincarnation was never

75
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,400
discussed in my graduate
education. It was never

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,880
discussed in the Western
religions or in the scientific

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,080
tradition that had kind of wiped
the slate clean for of the

78
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,300
religious traditions. So I just
erased my Blackboard and began

79
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,260
to rethink again, the larger
questions of life, incorporating

80
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,880
reincarnation. The second person
I met at that time was Stanislav

81
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,060
Grof, who is the foremost
authority on integrating

82
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,900
psychedelics into psychotherapy,
and he was providing a

83
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,544
methodology that actually allows
one to explore the deeper

84
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:43,844
dimensions of one's own
consciousness. So that began a

85
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,504
whole nother journey, a second
journey, which culminated

86
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:51,944
eventually in the publication of
this book. Richard mentioned LSD

87
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:56,624
in the mind of the universe. But
today, the focus here is on Ian

88
00:05:56,624 --> 00:06:01,440
Stevenson's what he started in
the revolution of really

89
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,120
providing carefully documented
evidence that reincarnation is

90
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,560
just simply a fact of life. It's
not a religious thing. It's not

91
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,640
it's simply a natural phenomenon
that's happening in the world.

92
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,660
Richard Rudd: And in your talk
you gave again, which will the

93
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,200
link will be? Here it was, is
you know, you as a wonderful you

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,820
know, years spent as an
academic, you kind of argue both

95
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,420
sides, so you show how you know
different people have come in

96
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,800
and and even written books to
refute those things, but how

97
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,420
they've fallen short. And so
there's this, there's this whole

98
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,420
story around it. And there's
this, this growing body of

99
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,020
evidence that maybe in the last
50 years has been documented as

100
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,580
I mean, it's fairly recent,
isn't it?

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,100
Chris Bache: It is recent. 50
years ago, we didn't have this

102
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,520
evidence. It was still
reincarnation. Was a speculative

103
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,420
topic that the theologians
argued back and forth on. But

104
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,160
now it's moved from the
theologians table to the

105
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,020
psychologist table. And now, as
we explore more deeply the

106
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,080
deeper levels of consciousness
in the depth psychology

107
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,980
tradition, we just find we're
bumping into this evidence over

108
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,700
and over again. Now the Western
philosophical tradition, of

109
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,680
course, is kind of still
saturated with the metaphysical

110
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,160
position of naturalism, which
says, The only thing which is

111
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,120
real is that which is physical.
So therefore the brain produces

112
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
your mind. So obviously, in that
system, once your brain dies,

113
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,480
your mind, this ceases to exist.
So it's impossible for there to

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,580
be something like reincarnation,
because it implies a dimension

115
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,360
of reality that's behind the
physical world, if you exist

116
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,320
there for any if consciousness
can exist there for any interval

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,800
of time between the death of one
personality and the birth of a

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
second personality. So
naturally, there's been a real

119
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,260
pushback from philosophical
traditions in the West, mostly,

120
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,440
they've just ignored the
evidence. They don't look at it,

121
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,360
and even those who look at it
and engage it, the foremost

122
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,060
critic that I mentioned in my
talk was a man named Paul

123
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,680
Edwards, a substantial American
philosopher, even in his work,

124
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,840
the evidence really a careful,
dispassionate analysis of the

125
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,340
debate between Ian Stevenson on
the one hand and Paul Edwards on

126
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,720
the other hand is that he just
refuses to look seriously at the

127
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,860
evidence because he's convinced
beforehand that the evidence

128
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,920
must be somehow faulty, because
We know that reincarnation can't

129
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,340
happen,

130
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,980
Richard Rudd: of course, and
that's often the way with

131
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,140
academics sometimes, isn't it?
Yeah, and what you know, a great

132
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,900
you know? So that's like, that's
really interesting in itself,

133
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,540
just the evidence. And I don't
think we need to kind of go any

134
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,080
more into that now, but it's
like, what are, I guess, you

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,520
know that. What are the
implications? You know, if we

136
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,820
do, because I this year, I've
done a series of videos myself,

137
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,840
short ones, just exploring the
implications of, what if I say

138
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,920
yes to this concept and I
explore it in, you know, if I

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,460
open my mind and my heart to it,
and I begin to really deeply

140
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,420
explore it? You know that the
the the implications, to our

141
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,540
worldview and the way we move
through life is huge, isn't it?

142
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:35,779
Chris Bache: Yeah, it all hinges
on time, how much time we have,

143
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:41,379
because, if you have a sense of,
Well, let me back up. I'm a

144
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,979
professor, right? So if I give a
quiz in class, I can expect a

145
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:48,699
certain quality of an answer
back. If I give an exam that

146
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:53,319
takes an hour, I expect a higher
quality of response. And if it's

147
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:57,279
a take home research paper, I
have higher expectations still,

148
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,379
because they have more time. So
for. Philosophically, if we

149
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:05,579
believe we only live on earth
one time, and we only have, in

150
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,599
some cases, a few minutes to as
many as 100 years, and we

151
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:13,919
extrapolate from that if there
is a purpose to existence, that

152
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,099
purpose must be proportionate to
the amount of time we have to

153
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:22,099
fulfill that purpose. But if we
have 100 lifetimes, 1000

154
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,839
lifetimes in which to actualize
the purpose of the universe,

155
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,039
then I think it expands
exponentially our potential

156
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,539
assessment of what the purpose
of existence might be. So that's

157
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,359
why it's such an important
philosophical discussion,

158
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:44,019
because once you understand the
dynamics of reincarnation, once

159
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:47,439
you grasp the fundamental
principle, then it lifts the

160
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:51,819
constriction of time, and it
allows us to begin to think in

161
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,619
terms of and appreciate and
understand the larger patterns

162
00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:01,019
of the pulse of cause and
effect, over arching over

163
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,579
centuries of time, and it just
elevates the whole discussion

164
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Richard Rudd: Absolutely. And I
think, like, you know, if I can

165
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,680
be blunt, like if you if you
have an inherent sense of a

166
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,180
divinity behind creation, then
it seems logical to extend that

167
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,160
into, if you know that this
concept of generosity, because,

168
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,060
if you had a divinity and you
only have one life, it's very

169
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,160
stingy. It seems like it doesn't
seem to have any kind of pattern

170
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,200
or reason to it. You know, it's
like I, for me, life is is just,

171
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,540
you know, spirit is just filled
with generosity and in terms of

172
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:49,480
time and and if we, and if we
kind of open to the eternal

173
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,980
nature of life, then of then, of
course, that would make sense,

174
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,340
you know, for there to be a
continuity of consciousness. And

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,520
I think that, you know, the more
people open to this, the more

176
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,600
they kind of realize it has some
deep root inside them, you know.

177
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,140
And I've, I've, you know, I
discovered that a lot because

178
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,560
I've begun to talk about it more
and more. And one of the things

179
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,980
I realized is no one else is
really much other than people

180
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,360
who doing past life regression.
Therapeutically, a lot of the

181
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,700
teachers and spiritual teachers
in the world today avoid this

182
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,460
subject. They, I mean, I don't
know if they consciously avoid

183
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,720
it, but they don't talk about
it. I mean, they get asked

184
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,460
questions, but then their
answers are kind of generally

185
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,700
quite short, and it doesn't get
picked up. And so, yeah, I'm,

186
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,380
I'm really interested in
something that is passed over,

187
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,880
that is so in, so obvious, and
it's, it should be in plain view

188
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,000
for all of us. Yeah, yeah. So,
yeah,

189
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,700
Chris Bache: isn't that curious?
I mean, I understand why my

190
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,660
colleagues at the University,
who tend to be, you know,

191
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,860
materialist and reductionist,
why I understand, but why

192
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,700
spiritual teachers wouldn't talk
about about it, or wouldn't use

193
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,560
it to sort of frame a larger and
expanded horizon. You know,

194
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,760
sometimes I've heard people say,
well, it can dilute your

195
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,740
intensity of commitments for
realization in the present. But

196
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,040
you know, if you think you have
many lifetimes and you're not

197
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,120
going to take this lifetime as
seriously, but I think that that

198
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,880
argument kind of evaporates
quickly once you look at it

199
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,520
carefully, yeah, I think it
deepens the textures of the

200
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,560
situations which we find
ourselves in. Let me just give

201
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,680
you one example, some of the
research of Michael Newton's

202
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,220
research, for example, in his
book journeys of the soul and

203
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,220
destiny of Souls, He and other
past life therapists have found

204
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,680
evidence that we choose our
incarnation. Now, I think in

205
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,980
some ways, many people don't.
They may kind of go very

206
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,920
haphazardly and take what's
available. But as you get

207
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,540
mature, you choose your
incarnation carefully. Now, if

208
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,340
we choose our care information,
our incarnation carefully, when

209
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,720
there was a time when we knew
more than we know now and we

210
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,180
could see more than we could see
now, if we chose the life that

211
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,900
we're living now, with all of
its ups and downs and challenges

212
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,580
and opportunities, then doesn't
that change how we might relate

213
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,480
to those very circumstances in
which we find ourselves, you

214
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,540
know, not to go chasing all
sorts of hidden mission, You

215
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,300
know, hidden meanings, but to
basically temper the quality of

216
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,760
how of the self responsibility
that we use in how we engage the

217
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,180
people that we're with, the
circumstances that we find

218
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,020
ourselves in.

219
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,440
Richard Rudd: Yeah, and doesn't
it make you also I mean, for me,

220
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,160
it makes me feel more. Like a
kind of eternal, cosmic

221
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,980
adventurer. So I, you know, it
enriches this time I'm in now,

222
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,760
it actually in where, in many
ways, it focuses me a lot more

223
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,560
into the present, because I'm
not worrying about dying, if you

224
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,800
know what I mean, it changes
that. And it's not just a

225
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,700
concept, you know, you have to
go, you know, this is my

226
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,220
understanding through my
teachings, is you have to

227
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,720
contemplate something very
deeply like this for it to start

228
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,980
to kind of take root in you, and
then as it takes root in you, it

229
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,080
brings out of your literally, I
feel it's the truth of it is in

230
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,240
our DNA. It's like it's, it's in
us. So once that gets triggered,

231
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,460
that kind of awakening of the
memory, it there's a sort of

232
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:54,100
certainty and a stability that
grows inside us that enables us

233
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,680
to handle whatever challenges
come to us in a really, much

234
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,200
more powerful way, because we're
rooted in this kind of eternal

235
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,260
acceptance of this, you know,
this is because you hear, I you

236
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,740
hear it all the time on people
on the radio, is I heard last

237
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,620
week, like someone just saying,
Well, yeah, you've only got one

238
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,780
life, so you've got to, you
know, really make the most of

239
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,820
it, which is a great thing to
say, but it's also you only got

240
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,800
one life. It's just, I keep
coming back to the it's that's

241
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,240
really a tight kind of reality
from which ever belief system

242
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,520
you're operating out of, yeah,
cuts the

243
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,180
Chris Bache: legs right out from
under you. Yeah? Because it just

244
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,460
because of correlating with that
is the usually, the ideas of

245
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,820
your exist in the universe is
being driven by blind chance.

246
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,380
It's just random mutation.
There's no existential

247
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,740
significance to the
circumstances in which you find

248
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,520
yourself in. So you only get one
shot make the best of it. But

249
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,240
then when you die, it's gone.
You're gone anyway, so who

250
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,000
cares? And that's just such a
demeaning and counter intuitive

251
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,740
philosophy of life. Because I
think when we look at the

252
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,940
beauties of nature, when we look
at the night sky, when we see

253
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,300
the pictures from the Hubble
telescope of the magnificent

254
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,120
patterns in the deep cosmos.
When we look around us at Earth

255
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,140
and look at the depth of the
emergence of life and the

256
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,580
emergence of self awareness on
the planet over time, all these

257
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,080
projects take place over
enormous sweeps of time, and we,

258
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,100
we are the first generation to
really appreciate how much time

259
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,680
the universe has had to be
evolving into the form that it

260
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,220
is now. If the universe and
everything it's doing takes

261
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,140
enormous amounts of time and we
only have one life, then

262
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,580
existentially, we're cut off.
We're not we don't participate

263
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,860
in that, in that massive
project. But if we do purchase,

264
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,760
if we live multiple lifetimes,
there's a good news bad news

265
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,000
situation. You know, the bad
news is, you know, well, it's

266
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,840
hard work in this lifetime, and
we'd like to have it over with

267
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,900
when we die, but if we keep
coming back, you know, there's a

268
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,980
larger project afoot. You know,
it's not a simple grade like we

269
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,220
thought it was before. It's a
whole university education. The

270
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,300
good news is, you're right, it
drops away. The fear of death

271
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,740
drops away. I mean, it just
drops away. The good news is, it

272
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,080
allows us to envision a deeper,
to feel, into the deeper

273
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,600
currents of life and the deeper
projects, and it allows us begin

274
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,500
to think in terms of longer term
projects. And I think this is

275
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,400
one of the things you see when
people take to heart this idea,

276
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,000
even without specific knowledge
of their former lives. I mean,

277
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,300
that's interesting, and that can
be helpful. But even without

278
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,760
that, when you really let that
in, and you look around you and

279
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,360
you realize that every person
you're seeing has been here

280
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,180
before and will be here again.
It just allows you to engage

281
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:18,720
life with so much more meaning
and intensity of the process

282
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,240
that you know, what we are good
at are things we have practice

283
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,020
in the past, things that we are
just getting started on, are

284
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,440
things we'll get better at in
the future. And we can think we

285
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,560
have that much time, we can
think in terms of that larger

286
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,520
landscape.

287
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,540
Richard Rudd: Yeah, and of
course, you know, we're not, you

288
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,320
know, there are many there.
There are many great thinkers

289
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,780
and philosophers and sages who
have come to the same conclusion

290
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,400
about rebirth, and, you know,
notably among them in the

291
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,460
western because of, you know, we
can talk a little bit about the

292
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,260
Eastern views in the east, yeah.
But Jung is someone who

293
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,240
obviously. Springs like straight
up into this, into the center

294
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,380
frame, because he's a bit more
contemporary. And, you know,

295
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,680
he's been this pillar of modern
psychology in the way in which

296
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,120
we now understand the
unconscious and and, yeah, and

297
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,540
the collective unconscious, and
mythology and all these other

298
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,760
transformational kind of
consciousness tended to

299
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,420
Chris Bache: hide his belief in
reincarnation, you know, he came

300
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,960
to it kind of late in life, and
he began to hide it because he

301
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,920
had pushed the boundaries so
much he was concerned about the

302
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,500
backlash. But there in his work,
and I

303
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,420
Richard Rudd: think that's what
happens with a lot of people, I

304
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,440
think they go, Well, I'm not
sure I want to go into that area

305
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,160
because it's, it's got a stigma
attached to it, yeah, and it

306
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,800
really has, isn't it? Because
the moment you say the word

307
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,960
reincarnation, you've got, like,
there's a whole kind of battery

308
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,620
of of skeptics coming at you,
whether they're coming from

309
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,080
Christianity or whether they're
coming from, you know,

310
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,500
materialist science. You know,
it's like you're really put your

311
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,640
head above the parapet,

312
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,440
Chris Bache: yeah, you know, for
years, for decades, I was taking

313
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,760
students into the literature on
reincarnation, and it's like you

314
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,000
just once, you put all that
aside, and you just look at the

315
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,120
cases. You just look at the
evidence. I mean, I found 95% of

316
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,700
my students were able to
overcome all kinds of

317
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,980
resistances, both secular and
religious resistances, because

318
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,520
they're trained in our culture
to follow the evidence once they

319
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,580
saw the evidence and how
consistent it was and how it

320
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,980
appeared in so many contexts,
spontaneous memories evoked

321
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,440
memories. They just they
accepted it. Once they accepted

322
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,140
it, it was a it was a life
changing event. And many of

323
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,320
their

324
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,440
Richard Rudd: lives, every
favorite stories that you

325
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,520
remember, of those, those
recurrences, because it's

326
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,320
Chris Bache: not I have so many.
And the one I opened the store,

327
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,500
the book with life cycles, the
one I started in the opening

328
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,320
pages, is a case of a young girl
named Romy Creese. And Romi was

329
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,160
born to Catholic parents in
Iowa. So it's like, it's okay if

330
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,740
they want to reincarnate in
India. That's their business.

331
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,840
But everybody knows Ian
Catholics do not reincarnate.

332
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,500
But she had spontaneous memories
of having been a man, Joe

333
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,640
Williams in a previous life. She
remembers being married. She

334
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,540
remembers three children, having
three children and their names.

335
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,380
She remembered dying in a
motorcycle accident, and she had

336
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:46,660
a phobia of motorcycles and long
story short, the researchers got

337
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,960
to her eventually, and brought
her to the town where she had

338
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,280
remembered living as Joe
Williams, and she was able to

339
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,680
remember identify the mother of
Joe Williams, she insisted that

340
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,780
they Pick up blue flowers on the
way to the house, because she

341
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,560
said those are the flowers that
she likes. And that turned out

342
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,540
to be true. She was able to
identify from pictures who the

343
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,740
people were in Joe Williams
life, the players of their life.

344
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,800
And she developed this deep
emotional bond to Joe Williams,

345
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,040
mother, who was alive, and his
wife named Sheila. He had been

346
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,040
married. She had been married to
Joe. Had been married to Sheila.

347
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,760
They were did have three
children. Sheila and Joe were

348
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,080
killed in a motorcycle accident.
So this is goes on and on and

349
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,320
on.

350
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,920
Richard Rudd: Hundreds of these
days, there's so many of them.

351
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,520
Yeah, so

352
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,880
Chris Bache: many these children
remember very intimate details

353
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,260
of family history. They remember
the they know the architecture

354
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,520
inside homes that they've never
been in. They can walk around a

355
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,820
town that they've never been in,
and they know their way around.

356
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,740
They remember the personalities
from the previous person,

357
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,940
person's life, and they remember
arguments that they had had with

358
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:12,660
neighbors, incidents that came
up in like the time a child and

359
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,900
they're when they were having a
birthday party for their child

360
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,380
that a neighbor's dog bit one of
the children in the party. I

361
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,780
mean, very, very things that are
just don't make the public news

362
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,320
and just

363
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,140
Richard Rudd: no little details.
It's the little details, isn't

364
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,380
it? There's one I've read I
loved. I can't remember exactly,

365
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:38,240
but I remember a reincarnated
memory of in a Muslim family and

366
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,140
and they took the little girl,
or think it was a little girl

367
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,100
into the family, and the women
were there, veiled, completely

368
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,840
veiled. And she identified from
from looking at them, from

369
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,600
seeing their body language,
without seeing their faces, at

370
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,680
anything she could name them and
and that was like, wow. That's

371
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,520
how deep this kind of detail
goes. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's fun

372
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,260
to explore those things. And I,
you know, I recommend to people

373
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,260
that you just take a look at
some of the evidence, because

374
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,160
it's very, I find it very
affirming, you know, sort of

375
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,140
like it's difficult to refute
that level of detail. And I

376
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,640
don't know you can come up with,
I'm sure good cynic can come up

377
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,080
with all kinds of Well,

378
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,500
Chris Bache: here's one for the
cynics. This. This is one of Ian

379
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,640
Stevenson's cases. They brought
this boy back into the life

380
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,780
circumstances of the previous
personality, and the wife of the

381
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,020
previous personality said, Okay,
if you're my husband, where did

382
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,440
you put the will? We after you
died, we looked all over for the

383
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,620
will. We couldn't find it. Yeah,
the little boy walks over to a

384
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,580
floorboard in the kitchen, picks
up a board, reaches down and

385
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:56,560
underneath the floor and pulls
up the will. Wow, isn't that

386
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,660
something? Yeah, it's how many
of those cases do you read

387
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,900
before you begin to understand
this is just happening. It's

388
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,880
just part of the rhythm of life.

389
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,960
Richard Rudd: Totally, it is
extraordinary. And also it has,

390
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,420
you know, there's, there's a
whole load of documentation

391
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,400
about marks on the body, isn't
there? You know, marks on the

392
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,220
body that relate to previous
events or, you know, I don't

393
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,280
think we need to go down that
route, but it's, it's, it's

394
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,940
another whole area of
documentation that

395
00:26:28,939 --> 00:26:31,819
Chris Bache: was Steve Ian
Stevenson, his last work. And if

396
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:35,779
you do want to go down that
area, you can read his two

397
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:41,799
volume, 1000 page book on
reincarnation and biology, which

398
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,959
he studies, 187 cases with
medical documentation, really

399
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:51,099
rigorous, rigorous, very, very
rigorous. And what we find is

400
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:56,379
that the death wounds, wounds
associated with death in the

401
00:26:56,379 --> 00:27:02,819
previous personality show up as
birthmarks are scars in the

402
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,899
subsequent personality. So this
is suggesting, not only do our

403
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:11,939
does our mind influence
subsequent mind, but even our

404
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:16,019
body, our mind's experience in
the body can influence the

405
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:20,479
formation of tissue in our
subsequent body. And that, of

406
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:21,919
course, just deepens the story

407
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,019
Richard Rudd: Absolutely. And
that's why I wanted to bring it

408
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,019
up, because that's what leads
into the therapeutic work,

409
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:31,759
doesn't it? Because if you open
to this idea, then, I mean, I'm

410
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,719
just thinking of all the people
out there who have difficulties,

411
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,079
maybe in their health or maybe
in their relationships, or maybe

412
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,219
addictions, or, you know,
whatever we're facing in life,

413
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:45,999
or just things that you know
that they they've complexes that

414
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:49,899
they find really hard to
overcome, yeah, and if we

415
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:54,279
understand that those things may
have a root in a previous

416
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,659
lifetime, and that that was
something unfinished or

417
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:02,759
incomplete, then It can open up
a whole therapeutic journey for

418
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,599
us. And that's what this this
whole therapeutic community has

419
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,459
has evolved out of this

420
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,520
Chris Bache: past life therapy
community. Basically, there are

421
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,280
any number of therapists who've
said something to the effect of

422
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,500
this, if you put someone into a
relaxed, inward, focused state,

423
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,480
a hypnotic state, but people
have a lot of misunderstandings

424
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,260
of what hypnosis, but it just
relax inward focused state, and

425
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,900
you invite them to go to the
source of the problem that

426
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,600
you're they've come to therapy
to address about 35 40% of them

427
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,120
will go back to something in
their present life. It'll come

428
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,900
back to something that happened
in their childhood or something

429
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:47,260
in their in their infancy, but a
significant 50, 60% of people

430
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,460
will go back to something that's
rooted in a previous lifetime,

431
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,320
and when they consciously
remember that previous lifetime,

432
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,900
and they consciously
reappropriate the trauma that

433
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,680
they weren't able to fully
internalize and address in that

434
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,840
lifetime, particularly death,
circumstances surrounding their

435
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,680
death, when they are able to
consciously remember and

436
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,200
assimilate it into their present
consciousness, then consistently

437
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,840
over and over again, underlying
psychological problems and even

438
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,740
physical problems begin to
loosen their grip on us and

439
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,800
untie the knots. So because

440
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,560
Richard Rudd: a greater depth,
because they have these roots

441
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,940
deep in the collective
unconscious, you know, and we're

442
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,200
going into the collective
unconscious to find them and

443
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,600
pull them out. Or, you know,
that's

444
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,600
Chris Bache: well, let's be a
little careful here, because

445
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,500
collective unconscious, in a
Jungian kind of usage, refers to

446
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:55,480
the unconscious of the entire
species. But so let's maybe call

447
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,260
a soul consciousness, which is
the collective unconscious of

448
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,020
the individual. You all through
time,

449
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,360
Richard Rudd: I got a good, a
good question for you, which is,

450
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,360
I have a really dear friend, and
he is a a kind of startling

451
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:19,620
intellect. He's in his late 70s
now, and really, really

452
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,480
intelligent, very spiritual man,
and yet he has a difficulty with

453
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,320
reincarnation, and we have
wonderful discussions around it

454
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:34,760
in the past. And his kind of his
very sophisticated spiritual

455
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,540
intellect, you know, where it
goes is in and I think others

456
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,920
may come from this direction as
well. That's why I'm saying it

457
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,960
is that you know you really
want, you know you want to

458
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,740
believe it. Everyone wants to
believe in the continuity of our

459
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:56,500
existence. And yet you know the,
you know, the the great Advaita

460
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,020
teachers, or whatever, that you
know that they would talk about

461
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,480
the surrender of the individual
ego, into the higher, you know,

462
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,140
into the back, into the ocean of
being, and that that's something

463
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,580
that you have to undergo in
order to attain liberation. And

464
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:17,880
so there is this, there is this
very strong spiritual kind of, I

465
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,540
think we, you know, we've
referred to it as up and out

466
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,500
kind of cosmology where you know
that we are here to escape this,

467
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,020
this cycle, the samsaric cycle,
and that, you know, so that we

468
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,520
can attain this liberation. And
we may attain it within this

469
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,760
lifetime, in a body, or we may
attain it, you know, afterwards.

470
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,280
So that's another whole kind of
interesting area, isn't it?

471
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,640
Chris Bache: Yeah, simply
because there are cultures who

472
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,180
have believed in reincarnation
for 1000s of years and have

473
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,780
developed a certain
understanding of it in their

474
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,580
culture doesn't mean that
they've got it right. And I

475
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,220
think that reincarnation is one
of those ideas that simply, once

476
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,240
we begin to see the evidence,
then it begins to deepen a line

477
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,260
of inquiry, which, for me,
personally, I think, is I've

478
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,680
revised dramatically the
understanding I had of

479
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,880
reincarnation borrowed from
Eastern traditions, Eastern

480
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,660
cultures. And one of the
traditions has to do with this

481
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,320
larger question, Where does
reincarnation go? Where is it

482
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,680
taking us? What is the what's
the end game of reincarnation?

483
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,100
And you're right, all the
cultures, all the religions of

484
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,600
the Axial Age, it came into
existence three to 5000 years

485
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,920
ago, all of them teach a
cosmological journey, that's an

486
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,240
up and out cosmology. So there
is a sense that we're trapped

487
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,500
here. This is not as good as
spiritual reality. We want to

488
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,000
develop, either in one lifetime,
if it's a Christian salvation,

489
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,960
salvation by grace, you know, or
multiple lifetimes to achieve

490
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,920
Samsara, excuse me, achieve
moksha, which is escape from

491
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,280
Samsara, escape from the
physical world. We achieve some

492
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,240
type of enlightenment condition,
which is the passport that

493
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,140
allows us to leave and not come
back. And all of these

494
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,380
traditions are up are basically
about escape. And that leaves

495
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,640
unanswered the fundamental
question, what is the purpose of

496
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,420
physical existence in the first
place? And now that we have a

497
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,620
deeper understanding of how many
billions of years of genius have

498
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,120
gone into the manifestation of
the physical world, it's not a

499
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:46,660
very satisfactory conclusion to
think that just within we only

500
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,800
became conscious of this deeper
dimensions about 5000 years ago,

501
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,040
as soon as we become self
conscious of the level of

502
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,220
consciousness, which we share
with all other beings and all

503
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,200
existence, as soon as we become
aware of That and can live our

504
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,280
life from that center, then the
purpose of existence is to

505
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,240
escape the entire physical
world. And I don't think that's

506
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,540
really

507
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,820
Richard Rudd: true, and it's
rooted in that kind of slightly

508
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:21,800
self denial philosophy, isn't
it? That you know that also is

509
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,880
many 1000s of years

510
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,840
Chris Bache: old. Yeah, I think
they're basically all the axial

511
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,960
religions got two things
fundamentally wrong. They got

512
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,380
many things right, but they got
two things wrong. They got

513
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,220
nature wrong. They don't really
have an adequate theology or

514
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,400
understanding of nature, and
they got women wrong. And the

515
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,420
two are connected, because women
are so closely connected to

516
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,500
nature, and they're
patriarchally oriented, and

517
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,420
they're escapist oriented. And I
think it makes as an historian,

518
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:58,840
I understand it. I think about
four or 5000 years ago, through

519
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,240
various psycho. Technologies,
either yoga or meditation or

520
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,340
psychedelic substances, we began
to have a deeper experience of

521
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,920
the mother universe, of this
universe that surrounds the

522
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,880
physical universe. Once you have
experiential contact with that

523
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,660
universe, it is so blissful, it
is so ecstatic, soaked that you

524
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,260
cannot help, and you recognize
that that's where we're from,

525
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,440
you cannot help believe that
that's where we belong. This is

526
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,200
not where we belong, that's
where we belong. Yeah, and they

527
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,280
develop a theology of return. So
they're the Savior comes to take

528
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,640
us home, the enlightened being
comes to liberate us back into

529
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,320
our home. But that still leaves
the question, what is the

530
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,280
purpose of creation? And I think
what we're beginning to

531
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,400
understand now, as our
experience of this mother

532
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,240
universe is deepened over time,
and our understanding of the

533
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,140
physical universe has deepened
over time, is that we're not

534
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,420
here to achieve escape velocity
and leave we're here to

535
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,080
incarnate more and more and more
of spiritual reality and

536
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,120
capacity inside our physical
being, so that we can truly live

537
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:15,060
and create heaven on earth, to
wake up and stay Yeah. I mean,

538
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,180
not just to wake up as an
individual, but to wake up as an

539
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,660
entire species and stay,

540
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,420
Richard Rudd: yeah, now that you
can't leave that. I mean, we're

541
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,580
going to discuss that more,
aren't we? We're going to come

542
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:31,760
back to that. But that's a huge
that's a huge window to open up.

543
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,140
It's this, you know, and you've
touched on a lot of themes

544
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,680
there, particularly, you know,
the thing about the feminine

545
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,560
that you know, the the the
physical, the physical body, you

546
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,280
know, like, that's what I think
I interpret, partly what you're

547
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,880
saying as well, is that those
religions didn't really

548
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,840
understand the physical body, as
you said, nature didn't value

549
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,300
because there's, you know,
there's vast beauty in this

550
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,820
physicality, and it's, you know,
perhaps what we're exploring is,

551
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,300
perhaps it's here to be
spiritualized. Perhaps it's here

552
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,020
to it's you know. Perhaps that's
why we're here to bring that

553
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,880
ecstatic realization deeper and
deeper and deeper into the form,

554
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,400
because then we're, you know, if
we see that that's our highest

555
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,780
purpose, we no longer want to
leave you know, because that's

556
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,140
then our role is, through
subsequent incarnations, to

557
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,500
bring more and more of that
light down into the earth, into

558
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,800
you know, to you know. And then
we're also taking full

559
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,480
responsibility for the body and
the earth, you know, which is

560
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,380
something we also haven't done
very well. Yeah, yeah,

561
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,340
absolutely.

562
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,660
Chris Bache: And if that sounds
at first disappointing, where we

563
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,080
would say, Oh no, I want heaven,
please. Thank you very much. I

564
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,400
don't want a transformed body
here, because here is still too

565
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:04,140
difficult. I think we may be
underestimating how what we may

566
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,280
be underestimating what is
possible and just what it would

567
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,080
really feel like to live a
truly, fully spiritualized,

568
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,740
enlightened existence. And here,
I think we can look at some of

569
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,840
the god soaked masters of
history who are truly living in

570
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,360
the god soaked condition, or
the, you know, a primordial

571
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,040
condition that is radically open
to the vast mind of the

572
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,080
universe, inside their body,
inside time and space. And what

573
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,340
we're seeing from these
mahasiddhas, these great beings,

574
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:48,220
is that they can do what we
would call miracles, because

575
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,600
there is so much spiritual power
concentrated in their presence

576
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,200
that it is as if the laws of
nature operate differently

577
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,500
around them, and they're showing
us a prototype of what each of

578
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,700
us is in the process of
becoming, yeah, no. And

579
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,240
therefore, if we imagine what it
would be like to have an entire

580
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,360
species kind of living in that
kind of presence, and what

581
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,260
Richard Rudd: and our physics is
is also pushing us in that

582
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,980
direction, isn't it, to the
understandings that we're

583
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:26,120
entangled with nature, with the
universe, and that you know

584
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,340
that, and my whole teaching is
based on this notion that in our

585
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,960
in our DNA, are contained these,
these sleeping, dormant codes,

586
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,680
these cities, these, as I call
them, 64 cities. And like you're

587
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,520
talking about that they are
they're an activation inside us

588
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,200
that's that is waiting for its
moment so that we can enter more

589
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,680
fully into the next phase of our
evolution, the magical universe,

590
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,980
the quantum universe, you know,
where our thoughts and our

591
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,920
feelings and our sensations are.
Are actually traveling kind of

592
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,740
outside our physical body. You
know, they're entangled with

593
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:11,520
nature. So nature then responds
with us to us, which perhaps it

594
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,980
already does, at a level that
we're not aware of. So it's just

595
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,920
about opening up those pathways.
You know, there's literal

596
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,880
pathways in our being, into
that, into that next phase of

597
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,720
our evolution.

598
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,080
Chris Bache: We are already
plugged into nature at very,

599
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,140
very deep levels, down to the
quantum level, in the unified

600
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,340
field, we're plugged into our
ecosystems and these subtle,

601
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,120
intimate feedbacks, and we're
plugged into each other. Our

602
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,260
minds wash back and forth, we're
already there. But when we can

603
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,500
become conscious of those
connections, when we can sort of

604
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,600
lift off the obstructive shadows
that are carry overs from other

605
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,940
sadder times, then that
connection becomes, begins to

606
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,880
rise, and it empowers a
conscious participation, and it

607
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,380
makes what was unconscious
conscious, and then existence

608
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,360
becomes more enlivened, I think,
and enlightened with the

609
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,380
synchronicities that sort of
indicate the broader

610
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,560
intelligence that's, You know,
that's alive in life around us?

611
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:26,119
Richard Rudd: Yeah, yeah, I and
I'm sure that, you know, I'd

612
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:29,299
love it if we could bring our
conversation also into, sort of

613
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,019
into people's lives, a little
bit, so that they can consider

614
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:36,619
their relationships and, you
know, from this perspective, and

615
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:43,659
how that might change one's
attitudes or views towards

616
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,919
difficult relationships or
towards, you know, what? You

617
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:53,079
know, what's the afflictions
that come up in us and that we

618
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:56,919
have to handle in our everyday
life? It really changes all of

619
00:41:56,919 --> 00:42:01,319
that, doesn't it? Because, you
know, then you look at life, and

620
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:05,099
it's actually a process of the
opening of the heart, you know,

621
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:08,399
which the teachers have always
said it's like every

622
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:13,319
relationship, its purpose is to
show us some grace. And I call

623
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:16,919
this this law of unseen grace.
You know, where every

624
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:21,079
relationship that shows up is
offering us some, you know,

625
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:25,039
particularly the difficult ones,
is offering us some incredible

626
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,179
teaching, some, some virtue that
we haven't yet polished. You

627
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,839
know, whether it's forgiveness
or whether it's you know, some

628
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:36,499
you know, clarity, or whether
it's you know, whatever it is,

629
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:40,719
it's just, it's, it's some form
of love that we are here to

630
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:47,319
learn from those relationships,
because they have. They come as

631
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:51,219
part of our teaching karma, you
know. So I always see like that,

632
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:54,339
you know, the ancients called it
this life a Leela. And I always

633
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:57,819
see these a game, a drama
theater. And it's almost like,

634
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:01,439
before you come in, you're given
this little envelope, and in

635
00:43:01,439 --> 00:43:04,259
there you open up the envelope,
and in there is like, Okay,

636
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:06,479
here's your script here, and
here are the, you know, and

637
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:08,819
there's going to be some things
that show up. And these are the

638
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,699
things you're going to learn
this, you know, you've chosen it

639
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:19,319
at some level. And so that
changes the way that we kind of

640
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:24,979
see behave, doesn't it? Yeah, I
think statics, I'm sure, like,

641
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:28,339
if you had personal experience
of that in your in your life, in

642
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,959
your emotional life, I mean,
that's

643
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,940
Chris Bache: Yeah, and it one
little one more step. It's not

644
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,480
simply the envelope that was
given you, but you were given

645
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,480
three envelopes, and you chose
the one that you felt was most

646
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,200
suited for your evolution at
this particular point in

647
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:54,040
history. And so it's your choice
to engage these challenges. And

648
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,800
yeah, and when we engage our
life in that way, as taking full

649
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,880
responsibility for the
circumstances in which we find

650
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,780
ourselves. In it. It allows us
to engage the challenges with

651
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,800
more patience and with more
dedication and with more of the

652
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,820
long term, because we know we're
not if this is something that,

653
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,360
if we don't deal with it now,
it's not going to go away, it's

654
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,880
just going to come back in
another form. So let's get it

655
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,620
done now. Let's let's deal with
it now. And it also allows you

656
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:33,620
to build on things. Because I
think our understanding of

657
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,800
reincarnation is being very
informed by the therapist

658
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,480
working heroically in past life
therapy. But if you only pay

659
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,500
attention to those cases, it can
tend to create an understanding

660
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,700
of reincarnation that is tilted
towards failures, coming

661
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,260
forward, that we traumas,
traumas, yeah, but it, but just

662
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,700
like the school system around us
has many faults, but most of the

663
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,860
kids learn and most of the kids
pass. Every year. And I think

664
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,120
most people rise to the karma,
the challenge of their of their

665
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,660
life. And that means every
lifetime, we're not simply

666
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,220
dealing with leftover issues
from the past. We're building on

667
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,460
assets. We're spending assets
and investing in greater

668
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,460
fruition in the future. And so
it's it helps us handle the

669
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,960
challenging circumstances, but
it also helps us embrace the

670
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,980
positive circumstances of our
life, the hidden talent which

671
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,840
comes forward unannounced, the
partnership which emerges that

672
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,620
we can we feel such a deep
kinship with this person that we

673
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,600
can go forward and do something
new with Yeah,

674
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:50,560
Richard Rudd: and I, you kind of
triggered a memory of mine about

675
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:58,420
from Sri Aurobindo, you know,
who spoke incredibly Clearly,

676
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,320
you know, with his penetrating
mind about the complexity of

677
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,260
karma and how we, you know,
because we need to sort of

678
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,040
probably discuss karma a little
bit and how it, you know, we

679
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,660
misunderstand it so easily by by
trying to oversimplify it. And

680
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,740
actually, you know, when you
look at the universe with all

681
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:25,040
its multiple dimensions, and,
you know, the quantum field. And

682
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,580
there's this, there's this,
these force fields operating at

683
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,840
different levels, but there's
this karmic force that's that's

684
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,160
equalizing and balancing, you
know, or that has a tendency

685
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,220
towards balance, we could say,
and is in allowing us to go

686
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,680
through this educational
process. But everything at

687
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,400
different levels is is
influenced by these, these

688
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,340
strands of the karmic force. And
that karmic force seems to have,

689
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,360
it's like this, the idea I said
about unseen grace. If you are

690
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:03,780
able to fully embrace it in your
life. Then you get the grace

691
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,020
through going through through
unwrapping it and but you've got

692
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,300
to kind of have the courage to
face it fully and really take it

693
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,080
in and let it in. You know,
whatever the suffering is,

694
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,620
transform it, transmute it so it
doesn't. Transmutation of karma

695
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:27,560
play a huge part in this
reincarnative theology.

696
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,800
Chris Bache: If we just look
around us, it's the web of cause

697
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,920
and effect. Everything is cause
and effect. We live in a

698
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,040
continuous web of cause and
effect, the air we breathe, the

699
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,840
weather patterns, our biology,
what we ate, the purity of what

700
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,500
we ate everything is this flow
of cause and effect the

701
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,920
universe, the movement of the
planets, the solar system. We

702
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,780
live in a continuous web of
cause and effect, and here we're

703
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,520
simply focusing on that portion
of the web of cause and effect

704
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,720
which influences the human the
development of the soul

705
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:03,960
influences our human
psychophysical development,

706
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,500
which is a subset with the of
this much larger cause and

707
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,820
effect. And in that context, I
think we've had a tendency, I

708
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:20,160
think, to narrow our discussion
of karma. Usually, many of the

709
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,080
teachers will talk about karma,
and they're only talking about

710
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,800
that portion of the karma which
immediately impinges upon our

711
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,580
spiritual maturity, whether
we're making progress becoming a

712
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,540
more spiritually mature person.
But a lot of karma, probably the

713
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,240
bulk of karma, is just a moral
cause and effect. You have a

714
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,360
habit. You practice something,
it becomes a skill. That skill

715
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,500
carries over into another life.
You have an automobile accident,

716
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,980
you develop a trauma of a
particular circumstance that

717
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:55,660
carries over into another life.
It's not necessarily about your

718
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,380
spiritual development, it's just
cause and effect,

719
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,900
circumstantial. Yeah, and so
when, as you open up to the

720
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,500
conditioning that's kind of
etching itself in your life, and

721
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:12,120
you lift it out, you engage it.
Lift it out, then that the

722
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,860
wellspring of your life becomes
freer. It becomes clear. And

723
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,900
you're, you're not ex you're not
stepping out of the web of cause

724
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,140
and effect, but you're you're
stepping into a greater freedom

725
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:28,160
within the web work of cause and
effect that surrounds you. You

726
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,260
have greater capacity to make
increasingly free choices,

727
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:38,840
greater capacity to choose. Ask
yourself, well, what do I want?

728
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,280
What would I like have, instead
of a compulsion of, you know,

729
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,600
grabbing, you

730
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,640
Richard Rudd: know, you know,
it's tempting, isn't it, for

731
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,760
some people to kind of say,
well, karma and reincarnation,

732
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,340
you know. And then there's this
story of like, well, that person

733
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,740
over there was born disabled.
Does that mean they've done

734
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,500
something terrible in their last
life? And and there's that

735
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,120
whole. Be a sort of
oversimplification over very

736
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:10,380
complex kind of arena where you
know we don't, unless you can

737
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,020
plug right into the soul quality
inside that person, inside that

738
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,540
being you don't really know, you
know what you know they could be

739
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,440
that hidden saint that has
deliberately taken on that

740
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:30,560
incredibly challenging role to
polish one particular virtue you

741
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,760
know or skill you know, like
over, over the period of one

742
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,840
lifetime, and equally, I guess,
like very short incarnations

743
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,860
that I don't think you and I
talked about those, But I'd love

744
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,320
to hear what you, you know, like
a child that comes in for a very

745
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:50,020
short time and then leaves, that
also has implications for the

746
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,380
healing of the whole doesn't it?
Because Why does a child come in

747
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,680
for a short time, or a baby is
born very, you know, for a very

748
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,380
short period of time, and then
there's leaves, this grief

749
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,760
behind it, but then there's this
feeling that it's also still

750
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,540
part of your life, yeah, yes,
explore that. I mean, we

751
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,660
haven't. We can go and talk
about that, yeah, yeah.

752
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,580
Chris Bache: You know, it's you.
We can recognize the principle

753
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,460
of cause and effect. We can
recognize the principle of

754
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,940
karma, vipaka, cause and effect.
But then we can get so many

755
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,460
teachers, I think sometimes get
or all of us. We think we can

756
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,760
determine cause and effect. We
think we can understand it when

757
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,220
really, we're just touching the
wrapping, on the park, on the

758
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,920
package, we're just really
touching the surface. And the

759
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,180
safest position, I think,
really, is recognize that we're

760
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,500
looking at a deep, deep mystery
here, and you're it would be

761
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,760
foolish to try to judge
anybody's karma that's just

762
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:54,220
that's a wasted exercise. Better
to stick with the karma that you

763
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,580
can penetrate within your own
life. And you're right, because

764
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,020
we don't know, we really don't
know what's happening when we

765
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:06,840
see cause and effect operating
around us. When you I would tell

766
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,200
my students, when you see great
suffering, you're see they're

767
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:16,200
seeing a sinner or a saint, and
you can never know which it is

768
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,380
so best not to make any
judgments at all. And I think

769
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,540
there are many hidden saints,
many more hidden saints, who are

770
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,240
taking on a lot of cause and
effect, either from their own

771
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,220
larger soul stream or from even
a collective soul stream. So

772
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,080
they're actually focusing in
their body, in their in their

773
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,780
psyche, what we might call
negative karma, negative cause

774
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,820
and effect for the uplift of the
whole and that type of

775
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:54,100
generosity and compassion we see
it around us all the time. And

776
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,160
good parents and good mothers
and good fathers, they would be

777
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:02,100
do anything for their children.
And I think souls at that deeper

778
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,840
level do that too. So, yeah, we
can't judge. We really just

779
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,880
couldn't judge. It's a waste of
effort.

780
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,880
Richard Rudd: No, I read this
book. I think I told you about

781
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,880
this book. It was and anyone,
it's a recommendation called

782
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,780
sand talk, and it's by an
Aboriginal from Australia or

783
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:26,180
part Aboriginal and really
intelligent man. And he tells a

784
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:33,140
story of when he went to to talk
to one of the elders about, you

785
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:38,720
know, the problems of the, you
know, the indigenous people,

786
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,060
particularly the men who had
kind of just got gone down the

787
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,420
role of alcoholic, the way of
alcoholism, and we're eating

788
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,540
really terrible food, and, like,
we're overweight and obese, and

789
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,880
these terrible problems that
he's and he was, like, really

790
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:56,380
concerned about. And the the old
elder just said, yeah, they're

791
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:01,140
the Warriors, you know, they are
taking on the karmic you know,

792
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,620
they are warrior spirits in our
tribe, in our lineage, and

793
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,000
they're holding this kind of
negativity in their bodies. And

794
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,640
you know, one day they will
become, they will move from

795
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,540
warrior to healer, and that's
the path, that's the kind of

796
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,380
evolutionary pathway, yeah. But
it was a beautiful it really,

797
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,880
like, it really stuck with this
young man as he was exploring,

798
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,920
like, wow, that's a really, kind
of powerful, empowering way to

799
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,440
see someone dealing with, like,
a cultural problem, you know,

800
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,420
or, you know, a societal, you
know, difficulty that's more

801
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:42,340
collective, you Know, that we
see a lot. Yeah, you know,

802
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,820
collective Karma is a, you know,
we're touching on here as well.

803
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,000
Chris Bache: Yeah, it's a very,
very deep, those deep currents

804
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:53,440
that run underneath that
requires us to open to a much

805
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:59,080
deeper, expanded spiritual
story. And because we often

806
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,240
think of Rhee. Incarnation and
karma in a very individualistic,

807
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,620
atomistic fashion, where we're,
you know, the individual soul is

808
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:12,360
involving themselves over the
skillful use of choice in in the

809
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:19,440
context of karma. And if we
start to sink into a larger

810
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,880
understanding, a deeper
understanding, then we recognize

811
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,260
that each individual is a
fractal point within a unified

812
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:31,580
field, and that there's a these
deep currents that are running

813
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:36,560
within the the unconscious of
humanity or the soul field of

814
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:41,380
humanity, and that we are all
players on a larger evolutionary

815
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:47,620
dynamic, then it just opens up a
deeper understanding of what's

816
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:51,400
taking place here. And I know
that we've sort of tagged this

817
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:56,380
for one of our topics for our
second discussion, but it's,

818
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:56,800
yeah,

819
00:55:57,759 --> 00:56:01,079
Richard Rudd: well, we plant the
seed now it perfect. You know,

820
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:05,819
when you go into that kind of
worldview, the perfection of the

821
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:12,119
choreography of what you're
explaining is just mind blowing,

822
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:16,319
isn't it? It's mind blowing in
terms of the interconnectivity

823
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,979
of soul groups and these
fractals and these patternings

824
00:56:19,979 --> 00:56:24,799
of humans and, you know, and
this is why, one of the great

825
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,159
insights that I got from your
your unit mind of the universe

826
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,819
book, because you described this
really well. It's a paradox, I

827
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:36,019
think, and maybe it's one of the
last things we can just discuss

828
00:56:36,019 --> 00:56:38,839
to hear today, because it's so
important, I find, and it's the

829
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:45,699
paradox of being an individual
soul and yet being everything at

830
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:51,039
the same time. Yeah, you know,
so how does that paradox? How do

831
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:53,919
we? How does that hold up? You
described it beautifully in your

832
00:56:53,919 --> 00:56:59,979
book, as I think you said the
soul or the or the you know that

833
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:04,919
the soul was open, open on all
sides. I think that was the

834
00:57:04,919 --> 00:57:09,359
expression used, which I really
liked, open on all sides, yeah,

835
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:15,059
and it's so like part of the the
ocean, and yet still a focal,

836
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:19,199
focalized drop, yeah, I'm under
awareness. Also, you have named

837
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:19,439
it,

838
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,440
Chris Bache: yeah, it seems, it
seems common sensical that you

839
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,460
can't be both a part and the
whole at the same time. Those

840
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,840
are mutual exclusive categories.
And even, you know, great

841
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,620
spiritual teachers, the Vedanta
tradition in Hinduism and other

842
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:41,440
spiritual systems, have said the
goal of life is to abandon your

843
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,860
individuality, dissolve that,
and allow yourself to be

844
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,460
absorbed into the totality and
to know the bliss of absorption.

845
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:53,020
So that means all the individual
capacity which we are developing

846
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:57,460
over all these incarnations, in
this view, ends in extinction.

847
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,320
And it's kind of wasted. Yeah, I
think it's wasted, and I think

848
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,160
that's it's an inadequate
worldview. And what has emerged

849
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,700
in in my spiritual path and in
my psychedelic path is a very

850
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,300
different kind of worldview that
I think we share, and that is

851
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,740
that that we are moving into
higher and higher, more

852
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,680
sophisticated forms of
individuality, that

853
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,140
individuality is one of the
great gifts of creation. It's

854
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:29,600
something the divine wants to
encourage in its creation and

855
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,340
but at early stages of
individuality, we experience our

856
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:39,320
individuality cut off from the
larger texture of surrounds. So

857
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:44,140
it's us against them or us in
the whole but when individuality

858
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,400
matures into a richer
expression, into what I would

859
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,900
call the birth of the diamond
soul, then there is both a sense

860
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,580
of being a specific, defined
individuality emerging out of

861
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:01,200
the specific Historical lineage,
and yet at the same time,

862
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,420
profoundly open to the larger
patterns of existence, open to

863
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,960
each other and compassionate
heart, open to other human

864
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,980
beings with whom we have such
deep histories with, and open

865
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,900
to, in a sense, the the
intelligence of the universe,

866
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:24,080
Open to the the perceptions and
the influence of ideas that flow

867
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,180
into us and this communion with
the universe, which and I

868
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:35,060
actually believe that you have
to have developed a very, very

869
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:39,260
strong individuality to
withstand the intensity of the

870
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,760
communion that's available to us
when we enter into communion

871
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:48,520
with the one, with the whole it
is, is if, if we didn't, if we

872
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,780
weren't really, really diamond,
hard and focused and clear when

873
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:57,400
we encountered the love of the
universe for us, it would just

874
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,800
shatter us. You know, we. Have
to be strong in order to

875
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,880
actually participate in the
deeper levels of communion.

876
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:06,780
Yeah.

877
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,940
Richard Rudd: And I think, you
know, that that's such an

878
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,840
empowering vision. It's so
empowering that's and it's also,

879
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,620
you know, I think it opens this,
this question of, like, our

880
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,300
notion of enlightenment, our
notion of divinity, we have to

881
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:24,020
kind of go on expanding that,
because it's just a notion that

882
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,200
we've inherited, you know, and
they and it's and even though,

883
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:31,880
you know, it's been useful to
get us to where we are, we have

884
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,640
to just go on expanding. And for
me, what is kind of missing more

885
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:44,560
in the current, you know
modalities is creativity, you

886
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,440
know, like that. You know, that
whole idea of it coming to an

887
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,280
end and then going out into the
you know, into the into the

888
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,680
wonderful absorption of the
whole you know, by maintaining

889
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,320
the individuality at the same
time, what you are maintaining

890
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,120
is creativity, creativity
itself, because then you're like

891
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:08,520
a shard of the Divine creative
essence. And it's like you say

892
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:14,220
in your book, go out and create
my children, you know. And if

893
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:19,200
there, if there were a divinity,
let's say like, and it, you

894
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,360
know, and it wanted to have
children, then the thing it

895
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,580
would want for its children is
to be free, right? And to go out

896
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:32,900
and create and to become Gods
within God. That's, that's,

897
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,320
that's the vision I hold that,
you know, we, we become creator

898
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:42,640
gods within the wider, Yes, God,
you know, lovely in a big G

899
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,840
Chris Bache: God within god,
yes, yeah, the creative spark

900
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,100
within the fire of creation,
yes, yes. I agree with that. I

901
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,360
share that. And it changes
everything. It changes how we

902
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:00,120
greet the children who were born
into our families, because we

903
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,180
know that they're not coming
from us, they're coming to us.

904
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,920
It changes how we see old people
and how we see little people,

905
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,220
because young people are not
necessarily young in terms of

906
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,240
their soul age. Old people are
not necessarily old in terms of

907
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:20,180
their soul age. It just opens up
a much larger tapestry, and it

908
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:25,340
gives us permission to recognize
the deep aspirations that we

909
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:30,140
have, towards greatness, towards
great creativity, towards the

910
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:33,920
great love, towards great
spiritual fulfillment, things

911
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,460
that we may or may not finish
and get through in this

912
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,220
lifetime, but we can, we can
move toward them.

913
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,680
Richard Rudd: It's a much more
in some respect, sophisticated

914
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,700
spirituality, isn't it? It's
more nuanced. It requires a

915
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:52,720
subtler kind of understanding,
intellectual, I wouldn't say

916
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,300
intellectually, but through a
subtler intelligence to

917
01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:00,240
understand it. It's not this
sort of, you know, here's the

918
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,140
law of karma. It governs
everything. You know. Bang, it's

919
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,560
not that simple. It's like
Aurobindo says, There are layers

920
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,800
and layers of understanding and
subtlety and nuance. It's like,

921
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,700
I'm a lover of tea, you know,
fine tea. And you know, when you

922
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,940
when you find something like
that, and you can be anything,

923
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,300
you know. You can be a chess
player, and you and you find the

924
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,740
subtlest nuances in the in the
in the thing you're really

925
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,040
understanding the layers and
layers and layers as you become

926
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:31,400
more attuned to it. And I think
that's what we are. We are

927
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,600
becoming more and more attuned.
The the more evolved that

928
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:41,140
individual soul essence becomes,
then the more the more subtle we

929
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,860
can, the more we can understand,
you know, these nuances, and

930
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,580
then we're kind of, I don't know
that we're really, we're really

931
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:54,760
inspired by the empowered as
well by the creative current. I

932
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,540
mean, maybe we can leave this to
the next one, but people always

933
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:02,460
talk about past lives, and I'm
my part of my teaching is like,

934
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:07,260
I'm interested in future lives
as well. And because when you

935
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:12,120
expand your sense of time
broadly enough, you know really,

936
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,880
like, really, don't hold back
anything. You don't need to just

937
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,920
look backwards, you can also
remember forwards. And because

938
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,600
there's this feeling that memory
has to go back, but memory,

939
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,440
also, for me, is like it travels
forwards, and that's what we

940
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,980
call revelation, you know? So,
so revelations can come

941
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:35,060
backwards and forwards through
time, into this into this

942
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:39,620
essence, and this essence can be
hugely expanded by those

943
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:43,240
revelations and and and more
focused than ever in the

944
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:48,700
present, you know, in the beauty
of the present moment. So, yeah,

945
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,820
I think that's the thought I'd
like to end on. But does any

946
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,880
like? Do you want to like close
us off?

947
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,520
Chris Bache: That's a that's a
really good thought and a good

948
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:02,880
spot to end on to me. It's. Yes,
the principle of accumulation is

949
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,280
one of the fundamental
principles I bring to

950
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,300
understanding what's happening
in creation. That the universe

951
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,520
is accumulating. It's learning.
It's a self learning system, and

952
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,420
so we are constantly learning.
We can't help but learn. Even if

953
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,200
we do a mediocre job in our
lifetime, we're still learning

954
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,860
in that lifetime. And if we do a
better job, we're learning. And

955
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:29,360
as we learn, we activate, in one
sense, I think we are learning

956
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:35,300
to be geniuses in every area of
life, a genius at chess, a

957
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:39,080
genius at relationships, a
genius in all the different

958
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:44,680
areas of life. And as if each
lifetime is a petal in a flower,

959
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:49,300
the soul is the flower and
there, if you just, I meditate

960
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,720
sometimes on a flower, and
imagine each 100 year lifetime,

961
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,400
it's a pistol and a stamen and a
petal in this magnificent

962
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:03,120
flower. And that's, you know, to
be a genius at life, to really

963
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,900
to be completely unfolded and
taking advantage of the

964
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,900
opportunity that we've been
given to grow and become more

965
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:15,780
than we've been. And again, so
many, even though many cultures

966
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,740
have understood reincarnation, I
don't think they've grasped it

967
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:24,740
fully. They haven't really seen
the the full potential of the

968
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:28,400
concept. They've really seen it
within an early limited,

969
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:31,880
limitation of it. And on the
future. We're going to talk

970
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,620
about time more I know as we go
on. But let me just leave with a

971
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:40,780
thought that Robert Monroe, the
great out of body researcher and

972
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:43,480
the founder of the Monroe
Institute of Applied Sciences.

973
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:48,160
His book far journeys, ultimate
journey, he said he reached a

974
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,640
point in his explorations out of
body where he discovered, he

975
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,800
realized that you don't
necessarily have to incarnate in

976
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,280
the next century. That
incarnation isn't necessarily

977
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:04,500
historically linear. You could
have former lives that were

978
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:10,560
actually lived in future time.
So that isn't that that just

979
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:15,180
like, oh man. I mean, I really
unpick that one a little bit.

980
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,480
Yeah, that really challenges
things. So in addition to

981
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:24,440
intuiting the future, which is
not yet, and bringing the not

982
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,000
yet into the now. I wonder
sometimes whether some of us

983
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,820
have sampled that future time
and are inculcating the

984
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,100
awareness in the now.

985
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,660
Richard Rudd: So that's what I
would call a current, the

986
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,720
current of involution, as
opposed to evolution. You know,

987
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,920
it's like there is a spiritual
force coming down, and there is

988
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,720
a there is an evolution,
evolving force going up, if you

989
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,840
want to do it up and down, but,
you know, yeah, it's like a

990
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,380
funnel.

991
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,140
Chris Bache: Yeah, Sri
Aurobindo, I love you quoting

992
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:02,340
Sri Aurobindo, because he's one
of my heroes too. Yeah, he's all

993
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,140
that clearly and I agree.

994
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,260
Richard Rudd: Yeah, great. Well,
what a wonderful beginning.

995
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:11,340
Chris, yeah, thank you. Where we
go next, yeah, me too, yeah,

996
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,980
take care. All right. Take care.
Richard, you.

997
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,000
Unknown: You.

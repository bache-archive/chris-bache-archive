00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,820
now your host, Bernard beitman,
MD,

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,360
Bernard Beitman: welcome to
connecting with coincidence. I

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,620
am Bernard beitman. I'm a
psychiatrist. I study meaningful

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,720
coincidences. My book called
meaningful coincidences, how

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,040
synchronicity and serendipity
happen, is available at a link

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,900
for those of you on YouTube
below, and we're talking about

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,160
something that psychiatry
doesn't address quite now, but

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,360
we got a problem here on Earth,
ladies and gentlemen, and it

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,460
tends to be denied. People don't
want to pay attention to it, lot

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,700
of different ways of avoiding
it. And we are here to say the

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,360
evidence is really strong. We
are in the midst of the sixth

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,580
mass extinction of life on our
planet. A mass extinction is a

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,460
short period of geological time
in which a high percentage of

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,260
biodiversity, distinct species,
bacteria, fungi, plants,

22
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,920
mammals, birds, reptiles,
amphibians, fish, invertebrates

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,680
and vertebrates like us die out.
And this definition, it's

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,500
important to note that in
geological time, a short period

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,720
of time can be a 1000s, 1000s or
even millions of years. The

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,920
planet has experienced five
previous mass extinctions, the

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,960
last one occurring 665, point 5
million years ago, which wiped

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
out the dinosaurs. As everybody
kind of remembers. Experts now

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,440
believe we are in the midst of
the six mass extinction. And

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,540
unlike previous mass extinctions
caused by natural phenomena,

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,780
this six one is driven by us
about human activity. Primarily,

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,520
they're not limited to the
unsustainable use of land, water

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,320
and energy use and the resulting
climate change. We have two very

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,740
smart guys here who are coming
at this question in different

35
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,040
ways, and it's the first time
they're ever talking with each

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,040
other, but they got their hearts
in common, and their minds are

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,580
really good, as many of you
know. Who know each one of

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,720
these? First is Chris Bache,
I'll introduce and then Dan

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,460
Siegel, Chris is a professor
emeritus in the Department of

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,760
Philosophy and Religious Studies
at Youngstown State University

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,380
where he taught for 33 years.
Key thing about Chris, besides

42
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,380
the living classroom, was where
I got introduced to him, and the

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,600
connection between minds of the
students and his were very

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,760
remarkable that one, and also
Chris, has the distinction of

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,980
taking, has taken LSD, I think,
73 times, and under control

46
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,280
conditions, high doses, and
explored, not explored,

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,520
consciousness, and he's come
away with some ideas about how

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,860
to mitigate or what's going to
happen with this mass extinction

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,540
we are now facing. Dan Siegel is
a clinical professor of

50
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,280
psychiatry at the UCLA School of
Medicine and founding director

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,300
and founding the co director of
the mindfulness awareness

52
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,620
Research Center at UCLA. He is
executive director of the mine

53
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,060
site Institute which focuses on
the development of mindset,

54
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
teaches insight, empathy and
integration. And his latest book

55
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,900
just came out this month, intra
connected is just about how this

56
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,200
whole thing we are in is
interconnected, including you

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,140
and I, and me and them and you
what we are. They together, kind

58
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,540
of thing we are in this all of
us, and because each of these

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,920
men come from somewhat different
perspectives, but again, for me,

60
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,000
their hearts and mind have some
overlap, I've asked them to join

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,640
me with a discussion about their
views about what is coming for

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,960
humanity and what we might be
able to do about that. So we'll

63
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,220
start off with each of each of
them saying something about

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,880
their answer to this question,
and then the dialog will begin

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
between the two of them. So
Chris, let's start with you, and

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,960
then we'll go to Dan.

67
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,140
Chris Bache: Well, I was hoping
you were going to start with Dan

68
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,500
first.

69
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:39,499
Bernard Beitman: We can start
with Dan first. Okay, okay, Dan,

70
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,319
you're on, Dan, you're on.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,940
Dan Siegel: Okay, well, whatever
I'm happy to go with, how,

72
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,700
whatever sequence which probably
relates in some ways to part of

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,200
what I'll talk about. But you
know, my background is a trained

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,900
as a scientist and then as a
physician, and. Then as a mental

75
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,760
health practitioner, as a
psychiatrist, and then working

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,200
as a researcher in the area of
relationships and the

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,840
development of the self, and
then becoming more an educator,

78
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,300
really teaching people in
different realms the work of

79
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,740
mental health, of education, of
parenting, of Policy and

80
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,920
Government, organizational
functioning, things like that.

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,380
And then I worked, starting
around 30 years ago, to bring

82
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,340
different sciences together into
one framework that E O Wilson

83
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,960
later would the term he used we
would apply to that called

84
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,100
consilience, finding the common
ground. And so initially it was

85
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,680
all the different scientific
disciplines, everything from

86
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,480
math and physics up to sociology
and anthropology and everything

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,740
in between. But then it opened
up this field of interpersonal

88
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,260
neurobiology to invite all ways
of knowing. So religious

89
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,560
studies, spiritual practices,
contemplative practices,

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,660
indigenous knowledge, looking at
poetry, at music, at art, dance.

91
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,780
So you know, any pursuit of
exploration of truth is invited

92
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,340
into the conversation. And you
know, we now have 80 textbooks

93
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:27,800
in the Norton series that that I
founded, and the the focus is on

94
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,640
reality. But one aspect of
reality we look at is the human

95
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,820
mind, and we see the mind as
broader than the brain. So

96
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,180
unlike how Bernie you and I were
trained in psychiatry and in

97
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,240
medicine since the time of
Hippocrates, 2500 years ago,

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
where the mind was thought of as
a synonym, basically, for brain

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,200
activity. And William James, the
grandfather of modern

100
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,880
psychology, kind of reaffirmed
that in 1890 in interpersonal

101
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,560
neurobiology, we say, Well,
that's true, but not the whole

102
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,600
story, that the brain is really
important, but it's actually

103
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,420
broader than the brain, this
thing called the mind, and in

104
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,240
fact, it's bigger than the body.
So then in these last 30 years,

105
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,760
there's been a fascinating
journey to look at what the mind

106
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,200
is from the perspective of what
the proposal is, is that it's an

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,320
emergent property of energy flow
that is arising both within the

108
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,660
individual and in the
relationality of the individual

109
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,520
with, you know, other people and
with nature, so people on the

110
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,340
planet, and in that sense, the
mind has features such as

111
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,640
subjective experience, it has
consciousness, it has

112
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,780
information processing. But a
fourth facet of the mind is the

113
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,540
emergent property that's been
assessed by the mathematics of

114
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,780
complex systems studied in 1980s
so pretty recently, it's the

115
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,600
emergent property, meaning the
interaction of elements of the

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,660
system give rise to something
larger than the elements

117
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,160
themselves. So we see all these
properties as emergent but one

118
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,100
of them, this fourth property,
is the self organizing emergent

119
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,300
property of a complex system,
and we see it as the system

120
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,380
being embodied and relational
energy flow. And this self

121
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:37,820
organizing process optimizes its
its unfolding through a process

122
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,040
of differentiating and linking.
And when optimal self

123
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,700
organization happens, this, what
we'll call integration, this

124
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,000
balance of differentiation,
linkage, it leads to a kind of

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,280
flow that has five qualities
that feel with the texture of

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,320
harmony, and those are
flexibility, F, adaptability, a,

127
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,120
coherence, which is holding
together well over time, C,

128
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,560
being energized with a sense of
vitality, E and stable, meaning

129
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,840
reliable. So this faces flow is
a way you would describe

130
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,180
basically optimal self
organization. And the proposal

131
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,700
from 30 years ago was that that
was the basis of well being, and

132
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,020
that when there's deviation from
integration, this integrative

133
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,300
self organizing process, toward
harmony, you get to either chaos

134
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,100
or rigidity. So in terms of the
question of human life and

135
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,040
individuals life, you can look
at, for example, attachment

136
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,020
relationships, and see that when
they're integrative, the

137
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,440
integrated sharing the honoring
of differences and promoting of

138
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,500
compassionate linkages within a
parent child relationship

139
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,780
actually is a relational flow of
energy and information that is

140
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,420
integrated, that stimulates the
growth of integration in the

141
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,160
child's nervous system and. And
so in the textbook the

142
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,120
developing mind, I wrote now in
its third edition, you know,

143
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,680
there's repeated support in the
empirical scientific literature

144
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,380
that integration is the basis of
well being. Smith and colleagues

145
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,420
in 2015 showed that every
measure of well being you could

146
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,560
find is predicted by basically
how interconnected something

147
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,780
called the connectome is. And
then, in the similar vein, in

148
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,360
psychiatric disorders, anyone
with a mental suffering, it can

149
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,540
be revealed as chaos or
rigidity. And every study ever

150
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,860
done of the brains of
individuals with psychiatric

151
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,160
disorders have impaired
integration. So that's that's

152
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,480
interesting, and then positive
interventions like compassion

153
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,360
training and mindfulness
training, those lead to

154
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,380
increased growth in integration
in the brain in in the very ways

155
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,900
that studies, for example, of
trauma, show that integration is

156
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,280
impaired in children who are
abused or neglected. So all that

157
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,540
being said, integration, then,
is seen as the base of well

158
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,420
being. So in terms of this
question of what's happening on

159
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,960
the planet, the many pandemics
we face. I mean, one is the

160
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,440
pandemic of loss of
biodiversity, known as this,

161
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,440
this mass extinction. But other
pandemics include racism and

162
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,780
social injustice, the covid, 19
virus, even you can look at

163
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,380
issues of polarization and
misinformation, the pandemic of

164
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,400
loneliness in modern culture,
and you know, the addiction we

165
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,860
have to screens. And also just
Climate The climate disaster,

166
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,340
all of those are examples of
chaos and rigidity, and all of

167
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,720
those I'll have you consider are
either worsened by or even

168
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,560
caused by and here's the
proposal for our discussion,

169
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,120
that the way the self is
constructed by the human mind

170
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,580
because of the vulnerabilities
of the human brain we create in

171
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,580
modern culture for a drive to
certainty what we're going to

172
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,560
name as the solo self, a view of
this center of experience as

173
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,340
existing only inside the
individual, and whether that

174
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,300
individual is by themselves or
in individuals like them. So

175
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,760
it's like a plural solo self.
You can basically see that the

176
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,760
heart of these pandemics, um,
including extinction, you know,

177
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,260
might be this solo self. And if
that's true, as you point out,

178
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,240
you know, this condition of the
extinction looks like it's due

179
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,820
to what the human species is
doing. So the proposal in the

180
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,080
book interconnected, and I can
show you the subtitle, so you

181
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,180
can kind of read it for
yourself. You know, it's

182
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,420
interconnected, but it's the
idea of an identity as we me

183
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,520
plus we as the integration of
self, identity and belonging. So

184
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,940
the idea there is that you can
find a way to see how the self

185
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,840
develops in the individual and
in modern culture. And that's

186
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,760
what I do in the book, through a
lifespan examination of how self

187
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,520
defined, as you know, a center
of experience that includes

188
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,340
subjective experience,
perspective and agency. You can

189
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:22,700
remember that with the acronym
spa, that this really scientific

190
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,320
view of how the self develops as
separate in modern culture fits,

191
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,380
in fact, with what the
invitation is from contemplative

192
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,580
practices from 1000s of years
and indigenous wisdom from 1000s

193
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,300
of years. So that here on this
unceded Land of the Tongva and

194
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,900
the Chumash in Southern
California where I am, you know,

195
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,860
the teachings were always about
humans were part of nature. But

196
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,520
in modern culture, there's a
drive to go from that verb, like

197
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,780
fluid, intra connected, meaning
we're connected within a whole,

198
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,780
not just interconnected, where
I'm connected to you, and that's

199
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,500
the inter, the between. That's
where the word intra connected

200
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,120
is useful. We speak from the
subjective experience

201
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,140
perspective and agency of the
whole W, H, O, L, E, the whole

202
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,460
of reality. And then in doing
that, then what you see is

203
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,220
indigenous teachings have
invited this, contemplative

204
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,420
practices have invited it. And
and this discussion in the book

205
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,400
is really just saying, Can
science join with those ancient

206
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:29,180
invitations to see how the human
mind's drive for certainty

207
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:38,480
makes us view identity as an
entity a noun like thing, rather

208
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,940
than embracing uncertainty and
opening to the verb, like

209
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,380
reality, of a more fluid
identity and a belonging that is

210
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,720
universal, and then what the
hope is. And this is, I think, a

211
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,520
realistic idealism, in the sense
that it's an optimistic view,

212
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,600
yes, but it says humanity. We
can, in fact, construct a self

213
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:10,080
that is interconnected as we and
that can lead to actions for the

214
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,580
greater good that are as if you
had stubbed your own toe of your

215
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,480
body, you take care of your toe,
we would see the whole living

216
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,760
world as who we are. So that's
that's in a nutshell. That's the

217
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,700
notion, and that's how it fits
in with this discussion.

218
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,460
Bernard Beitman: Beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful, Chris

219
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,740
Comments, questions and you

220
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,099
Chris Bache: Dan, that really
was beautiful. I mean, that was

221
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,299
beautifully summarized. And I
just really love the unfolding

222
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,279
of layers and layers and layers
of your research, and the way

223
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,119
you harness so many people's
research to and bring that into

224
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:52,179
into focus. And I'm sitting here
without any of the scientific

225
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:56,679
background a different get that
in a minute, but it in total

226
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,139
agreement with what you're
saying. Just being over and

227
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,439
over, from my side of
experience. Everything you're

228
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:03,839
saying makes perfectly good
sense, the balance of

229
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,739
integration of individual and
larger fields within which we

230
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:13,559
are contextualized, the ways in
which we push against the limits

231
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:19,199
at those different times and
where we're being pushed now, I

232
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,699
find it fascinating. I feel so
completely aligned with what

233
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:27,319
you're saying, and yet I come to
that with with a different with

234
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:33,979
a different story, coming to it
not primarily a theory based

235
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:38,179
story or a theory heavy story, a
research story, but an ex purely

236
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:41,439
an experiential journey. You
know that my psychedelic journey

237
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:46,899
is purely experiential, so that
in different ways, I experience

238
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:51,279
the rupturing of that core self
that you talk about, and then

239
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:55,539
the unfolding into a larger
dynamic field consciousness,

240
00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:00,239
repeatedly, systematically and
then experiencing that field

241
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:06,719
consciousness itself dissolve
like the small collective self

242
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,359
dissolved into yet another
deeper level of field

243
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:17,699
consciousness, where I so often
wish that I that I had A PhD in

244
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:24,679
physics and astrology astronomy
to better understand, assimilate

245
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,459
many of the things that I was
shown taken into, but it was

246
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:35,479
just an educated layman's
dissolving into the My

247
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:39,799
phenomenological sense was
dissolving into fields of

248
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:45,099
consciousness. Within fields of
consciousness and being

249
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,799
acquiring insights or being
given teachings about how those

250
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,479
fields self organize, how they
work. I mean, the living class

251
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:59,859
and classroom. Bernie, you
mentioned that that book, which

252
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:03,479
was basically my attempt to
understand the fields of

253
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:06,179
consciousness that were
connecting my students and my

254
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,979
courses and me as there is kind
of the spark plug within it, and

255
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:15,419
the ways in which my spiritual
journey was impacting them

256
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,079
through these mysterious
channels of inner communication

257
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:22,879
that The field of consciousness
is that entire book was

258
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:27,319
downloaded in 10 minutes in one
session. I had been pondering

259
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,039
the riddle for a long time, but
it just came through clear 10

260
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,599
minutes in one session. And took
years, of course, to open it up

261
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:41,611
and to do the research for it.
And yet, out of such a

262
00:18:41,611 --> 00:18:45,751
different, different itinerary.
I mean, I've been a professor of

263
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:49,711
religious studies. I teach intro
world religion courses, Eastern

264
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:53,851
religions, Buddhism, Psych of
religion, Transpersonal studies,

265
00:18:53,851 --> 00:19:01,319
you know, that kind of stuff,
outside of this modest academic

266
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:07,019
frame, the experiential journey
that I undertook, starting in 79

267
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:13,859
going to 99 would lead me to
such experiences that are in so

268
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,859
much in harmony with what Dan
with what you're describing,

269
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,919
Dan, Your way of understanding
the larger patterns of

270
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,919
organization that come up from
underneath. I don't know that I

271
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:33,799
have much to offer in the way of
ameliorating this, this

272
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,059
extinction crisis that we've
entered. I have, from these

273
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,399
experiences, a certain
historical framework that has

274
00:19:42,459 --> 00:19:45,999
that I use, that has been given
to me to understand what's

275
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:52,659
happening, a certain conviction
that we do make it through this

276
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:57,519
crisis, that it doesn't end up
becoming an extinction event,

277
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,719
that we do make it through this
crisis. Consciousness. And

278
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:06,179
again, I offer that purely on an
experiential basis, not on an

279
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:10,019
academic basis, not on a
scientific basis, but simply

280
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,979
because in these deep states of
consciousness, time can be

281
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,239
penetrated. Trans temporal
states of consciousness emerge,

282
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:21,079
and all the contemplative and
spiritual traditions and they

283
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,099
can be harnessed in a way and
penetrated and sustained

284
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:30,499
psychedelic practice. So that
part of my story is having

285
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:33,799
experienced the crisis, the
death and rebirth, crisis of

286
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:39,019
humanity from the future, not
from the present going forward,

287
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:42,459
but that, but also
simultaneously from the future

288
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:46,839
as something that has already
happened. And that doesn't make

289
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,519
sense, of course, within linear
time, but within psychedelic

290
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,939
worlds, that becomes possible,

291
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,780
Bernard Beitman: it definitely
becomes possible, and it's

292
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,060
understandable, and that the
fluidity of time is becoming a

293
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,940
calm kind of a common
discussion. Thing about

294
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,420
precognition is one way to get
into it. Dan, you were going to

295
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,380
say something I think,

296
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,280
Dan Siegel: well, I mean, no, I
think it's beautiful. Chris,

297
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,180
thank you and Bernie, thanks for
having us on. You're welcome.

298
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,520
You know, to have this
discussion. I you know there's

299
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,260
so much richness in what you're
talking about, Chris, and also

300
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:34,880
in in doing this consilience
strategy, that is where you

301
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,040
really have an open mind about
realizing there are many ways of

302
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,400
knowing you know, so that the
teachings from indigenous

303
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,500
cultures, some of whom use plant
medicines, you know, to open

304
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,420
their consciousness for 1000s of
years, you know, have insights

305
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:01,140
into the way systems function,
that on One level, sees the

306
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,660
patterns and patterns of the
patterns you know, that Gregory

307
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,840
Bateson would talk about. And in
looking at these 1000s of year

308
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,560
old tradition traditions, one
thing is fascinating is from

309
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,500
independent cultures that never
communicate with each other,

310
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,720
they came up with the same
conclusions? Yeah. So that's

311
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,300
just fascinating. The second
thing is that you have

312
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:32,420
contemplative practices, also
1000s of years old, that in

313
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,480
their own independent ways, have
come up with the same exact

314
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,080
conclusions. The systems nature
of our deep intra, I would call

315
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:45,100
it intra connected nature, and
so then you have to ask, from a

316
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,680
scientific point of view, where
you're always challenging your

317
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,920
assumptions and challenging your
hypotheses and doubting

318
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,520
everything you know. So it can
sort of drive you a little mad,

319
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,700
but it's a good practice. And
Adam Grant has a great book

320
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,100
called Think again, about
inviting you how to do that, but

321
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,640
in science, we do that. And so
from a scientific point of view,

322
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,340
we would say that, wow. You
know, indigenous wisdom is very

323
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,320
much consilient with systems
science and contemplative

324
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,180
practices very much consilient
with systems science. But then

325
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,040
you realize that in much of what
we do in modern culture and

326
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,060
modern education, there's linear
thinking about a leads to B,

327
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,320
leads to C. You focus deeply on
the details, and some of that is

328
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,580
incredibly useful. Like there's
a virus killing people, let's

329
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,260
look at its particular
molecules. Let's make an

330
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,000
antibody, and let's make it so
we can have RNA that matches it

331
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,780
in some way. And let's make a
vaccine. So now, okay, we have a

332
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,200
vaccination based on RNA that we
discovered because we were

333
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,280
linear thinkers. So we want,
need to embrace linear thinking

334
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,180
however. You know, in there is
another way to think in systems

335
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,900
terms. And you know this
practice that I that that called

336
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,940
the wheel of awareness, where
you take the concept of

337
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,660
integration and take the the
conciliant concept that

338
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,140
consciousness is needed for
change, and then you bring those

339
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,840
two conciliant notions,
integration is well being

340
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,100
consciousness needed for change,
and then you integrate

341
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,360
consciousness. So I did this
with my patients. Then I did it

342
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,880
for my students, and they were
doing it with their patients.

343
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,700
People started getting better.
So I started doing the workshops

344
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,480
before the viral pandemic hit.
You know, my my assistant

345
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,640
counted this up. I did this with
50,000 people, in person, 50,000

346
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,640
and I would get the responses,
and you know what, when they

347
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,340
were in the basically, you
distinguish, you differentiate

348
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,960
the hub of this metaphoric wheel
as pure awareness. There's the

349
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,740
knowing of consciousness, like
if I say hello, you have both

350
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,660
the hello and the knowing. I
said, Hello, you. So we put the

351
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,940
knowing in the hub. We put the
known of, in this case, sound of

352
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,300
Hello on the rim. And anyway,
people do the practice. And you

353
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,280
can do it from my website for
free and and so when, when we do

354
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,220
this, when people bend the spoke
of attention that they're moving

355
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,360
around the rim as part of the
practice into the hub, the

356
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,780
common statements are, oh, my
God, I'm connected in a way I've

357
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,800
never felt connected. My sense
of a separate self dissolves.

358
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:38,480
Time disappears. You know, love
is there? God, I'm with the

359
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,240
universe. There's just this
eternity and infinity, you know,

360
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,940
this kind of thing, over and
over and over again. Even

361
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,460
people, you might say, well,
it's a selected group of 50,000

362
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,580
people wanted to hear you
select. I've had people drag

363
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,340
there who didn't even want to be
there, or people in, I've done

364
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,980
it at parliaments, you know,
where people did not want to be

365
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,100
at this workshop and they were
forced by their government to do

366
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,880
it. Or their spouses brought
them, and they had the same

367
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,940
experience. They could be never
having meditated before or

368
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,540
running monasteries, and they
have the same experience. So

369
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,600
what, what you'll see in this
book called aware, or this book

370
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,520
called Mind, or this book
interconnected, is a question,

371
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:23,480
why is it on the rim? People
feel locked into time, like a

372
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,080
thought comes and goes, or a
memory is of a particular time

373
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,420
in your life, but in the hub,
it's timeless. So I did a deep

374
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,980
search. I happened to be
teaching with about 150

375
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,780
physicists at this meeting per
week. So I asked him, you know

376
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,500
what's what's energy, of course,
because I'm fascinated with

377
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,800
that. But what's time? And you
know, this is a controversial

378
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,980
thing to say. Anything in
science is controversial. You

379
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,800
can say A and someone will say,
No, it's B, and you someone says

380
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,980
no, it's C, so you have to be
ready for that. But for some of

381
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,420
the physicists, just to quote
some of them, there are two

382
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,820
realms, and this was on the
cover of Scientific American in

383
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,740
July of 2018 the month before my
book aware came out. And I was

384
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,500
so relieved, because I thought,
people are gonna think I'm nuts,

385
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,400
because aware was all about
these two realms. But the fact

386
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,780
is, according to these
physicists that I was with and

387
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,100
subsequently reading a lot about
that view, and in Scientific

388
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,420
American certainly said it. In
the large object world that

389
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,920
Newton studied 350, years ago,
macro states, large objects,

390
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,880
there's something called the
second law of thermodynamics.

391
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,240
And that law says that as things
unfold, they tend to fall into

392
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,280
entropy, fall toward randomness,
they fall apart. Well, that law

393
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,240
only applies, according to these
physicists, to the Newtonian

394
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:57,700
macro state world. 100 years
ago, the capacity in Technology

395
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,840
to study small things like
electrons and photons led to the

396
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,340
realization that the micro state
realm didn't have that property

397
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,040
of the second law of
thermodynamics, and it's that

398
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,040
awareness that things are moving
with what's called an arrow of

399
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,440
time, we probably name as time,
so it has a feeling of linearity

400
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,300
to in the Newtonian macro state
realm. But just like you can

401
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,120
walk on land and has certain
properties. You can jump into

402
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,120
the water and you swim. And it's
different properties that's a

403
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,320
different realm, one reality,
two realms, water and land. The

404
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,280
same thing is true. Physicists
tell us that there is a micro

405
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,000
state realm where, because the
second law of thermodynamics

406
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,460
doesn't apply, there is no arrow
of time, and there is no need in

407
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,120
the equations that are super
accurate about probability in

408
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,360
the micro state realm, there's
no need for a t variable. You

409
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,560
don't have a time variable. It's
timeless. So I went to the

410
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,380
physicist, and I said, if I draw
it out like this, does this

411
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,660
work? They go, that's what it
would be if you drew it out.

412
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,500
They hadn't drawn out, but I
drew it out. So I said, Okay,

413
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,520
well, then the mind matches onto
this. For these 50,000 people

414
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,000
that did it and those that
responded, it seems to match

415
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,900
where pure awareness, you're
dropping into the quantum realm,

416
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,900
where it's timeless. And in that
sense, it's you know, whether

417
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,980
you talk about being able to go
the past, future or present, it

418
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,520
becomes meaningless, and self
and other starts to shift,

419
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,520
because the experience in the
quantum realm is verb like

420
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,700
unfoldings that are massively
connected with one another. The

421
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,560
Nobel Prize was just given in
2022 for entanglement being

422
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,080
proven meaning it's non locality
that in the quantum realm, yeah,

423
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,580
you know, there's, there's the
experience in the Newtonian

424
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,460
realm of separation and time and
space doesn't exist. There

425
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,720
things are massively connected,
especially across space which

426
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,260
doesn't have it doesn't impede
relational connections. So I say

427
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,040
all that because. Because, you
know, I've been writing about

428
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,580
this. I've had neuroscientists
chase me down hallways after a

429
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,180
lecture I give, saying, Stop
talking like that. Stop talking

430
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,640
like that. I said, Well, what?
Stop talking like what? They

431
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,080
said, why would you talk about
quantum physics and the mind? I

432
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,500
said, Well, if the mind is an
emergent property of energy, and

433
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,640
the physicists that study energy
more than anyone else in the

434
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,360
world. Tell us there are two
realms. Then I'm just saying

435
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,840
it's a possibility that these
realms explain things like

436
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,980
psychedelic use, yeah, that you
drop out of the Newtonian thing.

437
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,000
So when people heard this, they
had me go to Newton's house in

438
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,320
England, where the original
Apple Tree is there, and we did

439
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,020
the wheel of awareness around
the apple tree. They made a

440
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,080
documentary film of it. It's
hilarious, but we paid our

441
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,920
homage to Newton. Because I say
to people, look when you leave

442
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,640
this workshop, get in your
Newtonian body, get in your

443
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,580
Newtonian car. When you see a
red light, press on the

444
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:02,640
Newtonian brakes and stop your
car in time, because if you

445
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,700
don't, you will become one with
everything in the intersection,

446
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,740
there's a relativistic world
where you're in a body, and

447
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,320
there's the universal, as
contemplative teachers like

448
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,860
Thich Nhat Hanh would say. So
this, just as a scientific

449
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,620
adding to the discussion doesn't
take the place of to say there

450
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,860
are these two realms. And
listen, when people do the wheel

451
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,500
of awareness and are given the
mystical experience of scale,

452
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,680
they get the same ratings as if
they were on Psilocybin,

453
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,920
Bernard Beitman: yeah, yeah.
Okay,

454
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,640
Chris Bache: Dan, I love hearing
you. Riff, man. I mean, that's

455
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,440
just beautiful. Everything
you're you're doing and putting

456
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,660
together is just beautiful.

457
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Bernard Beitman: Rift is, right,
that's a good word for it. Just,

458
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,960
he just, it. Just needs a little
music, which his son could

459
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,500
provide.

460
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,060
Dan Siegel: And Alex siegel.com
an album yesterday,

461
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,880
Bernard Beitman: I looked, oh,
really, yeah, his son's a

462
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,740
musician. Now, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna do it down to like

463
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,820
somewhere, but in that traffic
jam at the red light, about to

464
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,680
step on the break and bring us
to Chris's classroom, where I've

465
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,760
really first got introduced to
Chris and try there to talk

466
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,740
about intra connection and
experiences Chris had in that

467
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,320
classroom, which was my
introduction to how, another

468
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,440
introduction how it's happening
right now, not just between two

469
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,180
people or not a psychedelic out
into the mystery, but Chris

470
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,160
would be somehow all doing his
own riffing about something as a

471
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,640
as teacher, as teacher, and
people would come up to him as

472
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,420
students would come up to him
afterwards to say, you have just

473
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,120
answered a problem that I have
been dealing with

474
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,720
psychologically, and how that
began to be, what I thought now

475
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,840
is what you're talking about,
about intra connection, that

476
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,400
it's one, it's one we there.
It's one mind of some kind in

477
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,080
that classroom, something, in
your terms, quantum begins to

478
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,760
happen, where Chris is
intuitively, subconsciously

479
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,020
coming up with something
students need without knowing

480
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,920
that he's doing it.

481
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,940
Chris Bache: Yeah, I It's one of
the reasons, one of the many

482
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,140
reasons I'm so comfortable with
what you're saying, Dan, because

483
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,000
it it's so coherent with what my
experience has been in the

484
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,580
classroom, an understanding of a
growing understanding of the

485
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:38,060
porosity of mind, of the the
feel, nature of our individual

486
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,980
consciousness, The Field nature
of the collective consciousness,

487
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,520
the way that individuals, when
they come together and focus

488
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,620
their intention, they create a
field and that that classes

489
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,880
develop feels over over decades,
they get stronger and stronger.

490
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,540
The more Morphic genetic fields,
the more students study this

491
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,760
stuff around this particular
teacher, this field gets

492
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,600
stronger, and it became what
happened for me is completely

493
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:15,060
against my will and without my
guidance. I started filling in

494
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,660
blanks in my lectures, just
opportunities to explain some

495
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,520
principle I was explaining with
examples that just came out of

496
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,120
my imagination. And students
started come up, coming up to

497
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,760
me, and they say, this is
exactly what happened to me this

498
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,120
week, or this is exactly what
happened to my mother. And this

499
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,700
kept happening over and over. I
thought, well, first I thought,

500
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,080
Oh, okay. Chance you know, okay.
But it kept happening so much,

501
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,660
and then over the course of
time, as my spiritual practice

502
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,960
deepened, which happened to be a
psychedelic practice, but it's

503
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,780
irrelevant that it's psychedelic
scene. It's really about

504
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,260
spiritual practice. As my
spiritual practice deepened,

505
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:59,860
this this access to my students,
mind deepened and began to.

506
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,200
Arrow In, it seemed, on places
where they were hurt or where

507
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,460
they were wounded, or where they
were held in block until the

508
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:14,040
next stage of their life and and
working together or just being

509
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,440
in the classroom with me while I
was opening up to these very

510
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,440
intense, very large, very pure
states of awareness. It just

511
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,260
began to cascade around me in my
classroom. And so I developed

512
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,220
what I call, and I know it's
just just metaphor, I think talk

513
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,220
about the atomistic, the
Newtonian approach to teaching,

514
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,100
and the atomistic, which really
is about individual cells

515
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,060
communicating with individual
cells, transmitting across the

516
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,800
distance, versus what I call a
quantum teaching, teaching

517
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,740
within the reality of fields,
teaching with an awareness that

518
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,520
my mind has an active influence
on the minds of my students

519
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,620
before the class even begins to
meet, and Taking responsibility

520
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,600
for this mind to mind field
effect, especially when you're

521
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,500
dealing with a mind which is
carrying the kind of energy that

522
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,520
starts to flow in you from doing
very intense spiritual practice,

523
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,680
in my case, a psychedelic
practice. So I developed, and I

524
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,260
really Juanita Brown's work in
Cafe conversations were very

525
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,280
helpful to me to how to catalyze
and how to harness this

526
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,520
collective energy that is in the
room, and how to harness it in

527
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:36,440
conversations and how to distill
it in written form. Yeah, I mean

528
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,920
to me the and in the living
classroom, I don't talk about

529
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,840
psychedelics at all. The
backstory is, I was doing this

530
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,920
psychedelic practice in private.
It began to impact my students.

531
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,900
This is how I worked it all out.
And 1/3 of the book are student

532
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:58,360
essays, things that they shared
with me. And I didn't want

533
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,220
psychedelics to get in the way
of you know, grammar school

534
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,280
teachers, high school teachers,
college teachers. It's an it's

535
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,320
about the nature of
consciousness. It's about the

536
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,980
nature of mind. It's about, as
you say, Dan, a quantum

537
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,980
understanding of mine, a quantum
envisioning of the human

538
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,060
potential. And it doesn't negate
at all the atomic truth, does

539
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,740
it? You know the reality of
individual mind. I know things

540
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,140
that they don't they want,
things that I know in the

541
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,460
exchange of stuff,

542
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,000
Bernard Beitman: what I what I
hear from what you're saying,

543
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,380
Chris and the classroom, and I'm
wondering about this with Dan

544
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:43,060
and I get this experience at
dance where it appears that your

545
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,420
consciousness, Chris and
certainly Dan, or your

546
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,180
consciousness when you're with a
patient, because I know that as

547
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,820
well, you begin to form a little
unit of togetherness that begins

548
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:00,300
to be intra connected, that we
Share some responsibility, each

549
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,520
of us who have some awareness of
the awareness of being in this

550
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,800
group mind with people, and that
what our thoughts do and our

551
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,060
emotions do, and what are the
things that we might not be so

552
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,320
conscious of, can do is
influence that field. So there's

553
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,620
a responsibility involved in our
own thinking about what's going

554
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,560
on here and perhaps what we want
to have happen. I think about

555
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,040
that one.

556
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:34,519
Dan Siegel: Yeah, that's so
beautiful. And, you know, Chris,

557
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:41,019
it's, it's great to hear this.
You know, some people would use

558
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:45,819
the phrase relational sensing,
or relational fields. And with

559
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:50,919
metabol and Peter Sangay and the
group from MIT, you know, we're

560
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:53,559
trying to figure out how to
study those things in a

561
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:59,499
classroom. So we talk about
generative social fields that

562
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:03,599
that, and we've picked out
several teachers that seem to

563
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,179
create exactly what you're
talking about in a classroom.

564
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:08,939
We've then brought them
together, and then we asked them

565
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:12,059
very directly, what are you
doing? Because everyone realizes

566
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,939
when they walk in that room,
they can feel it. And the

567
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:19,259
teachers say the same thing.
They have no idea. They they

568
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:24,319
just do it. So we we're making
films of them, and then we're

569
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,899
going to study the films,
because they can't articulate

570
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:31,339
it. Yeah, break it down. You
know this? So, so you know when,

571
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:34,879
when Michael Faraday came up
with electromagnetic fields that

572
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:37,579
you could not see with your
eyes, people thought he was

573
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:41,799
nuts, right? But now, all of our
electronics are based on these

574
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:45,639
invisible fields. And my dear
friend, John O'Donoghue, you

575
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,239
know, we used to teach together
a lot, and he would call himself

576
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:51,879
a mystic, and the people came to
study with him, you know, the

577
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:55,119
mystics. So I said, John, what's
a mystic? He said, it's someone

578
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,119
who believes in the reality of
the invisible. You know. Know,

579
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,779
and it's a beautiful way of
describing it. It really because

580
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:07,979
it wasn't my background. He was
a Catholic priest and a mystic

581
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:12,239
and poet and a philosopher, but
it wasn't my background, and he

582
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:14,819
didn't have a background in
science, but it really teaching

583
00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:18,299
with him over all those years
really changed me, because I

584
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:24,739
realized the true scientific
stance is to say you cannot see

585
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:30,859
visibly everything that is real.
So even with the system stuff at

586
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:33,859
MIT, you know, we're trying to
say, well, what are relational

587
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:37,459
fields? You know, is it just the
feeling you get as an individual

588
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:40,599
from the way other individuals
reacting? Or is there an actual

589
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,019
field. We don't have an answer
to that, but I think the the

590
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:50,679
experiences are fascinating. And
I was recently on a trip in the

591
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:54,699
Grand Canyon, and, you know, you
go down the canyon and you're

592
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:58,719
with rocks that were formed, you
know, 1.8 billion years ago,

593
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:01,619
yeah. So you get a whole
different sense of, you know,

594
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,879
the term geological time. But
with the humans that were on the

595
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:09,119
trip, you know, some were
saying, you know, how could it

596
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,199
happen that I get a
communication from a relative,

597
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:16,739
like, that's 10,000 miles away,
someone's sick, someone had an

598
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:19,379
accident, someone's dying,
whatever. And I know it, and

599
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:22,459
then I find out later I knew it
exactly when it was happening.

600
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:27,919
And I said, Well, no one knows
why, but that kind of very

601
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:32,119
specific thing might be
explained by entanglement, this

602
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,899
idea of non locality, that if
your minds are in a relationship

603
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:39,739
with another person's mind,
basically, if that's really a

604
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:44,259
process of energy flow. And
since energy has these this

605
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:47,679
quantum property that's now been
proven with a Nobel Prize, you

606
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,479
know that non locality, that is
entanglement, exists where

607
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:56,079
Newtonian spatial separation
doesn't really change the

608
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,799
relationality of something. So
it's not like what Einstein was

609
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:02,339
worried that it was spooky
action at a distance. He called

610
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:05,519
it. But it isn't. It isn't that
something's flowing from here to

611
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,999
there so fast, it's faster than
the speed of light. It's that

612
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:13,379
there is no such thing as
spatial separation. So that's

613
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:17,219
been proven now, and it like in
a linear, Newtonian way you go,

614
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:20,479
that's not possible. It's not
possible. Well, we have to drop

615
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:25,879
out of the that way of limited
thinking. So then, then, when

616
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,659
you see, and I think Michael
Pollan's book had to change your

617
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:34,459
mind on psychedelics, you know,
the very last paragraph, he

618
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:37,879
says, no one really knows how
these work, but maybe it has

619
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:41,679
something to do that quantum
stuff, you know. So I wrote to

620
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,259
him, and I said, Well, here's an
entire book on that quantum

621
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:49,719
stuff. You know, the book of
called aware. And you know,

622
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:52,899
there's a beautiful book called,
you matter more than you think.

623
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:56,619
You know, the quantum approach
to social change. And very

624
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:59,199
carefully, and this was a Nobel
Prize winner, did this very

625
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:05,099
carefully. She she really, it's
Karen. Karen O'Brien is the

626
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:09,299
author, you know. She very
carefully says, this may not be

627
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,379
true, but it might be true.
Let's apply the findings in

628
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:16,919
quantum physics to social
change, and it relates to

629
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:19,439
everything we're talking about
in the six extinction. And what

630
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:22,999
it does is is it allows us, you
know, and when I was around

631
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:27,859
Newton's apple tree, you could
feel it. It allows us to honor

632
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:31,279
linear thinking in the macro
state world, and realize, you

633
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:34,219
know, stop the car to red light
and all that stuff. And at the

634
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:39,439
same time, what it does is, it
gives us a pathway, as Joanna

635
00:43:39,439 --> 00:43:43,839
Macy says, you know, in she uses
term the great turning, meaning,

636
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,299
let's get away from the great
unraveling of the Sixth

637
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:50,379
Extinction, and let's turn the
way humanity is. So when she

638
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:53,199
read the book interconnected,
she was saying, you know, this

639
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,439
is the evolution and the
revolution we need. And she had

640
00:43:56,619 --> 00:44:00,039
always written about we need a
quantum change in consciousness.

641
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:03,959
Now, what does that mean? I
think that means the linear solo

642
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:10,319
self has had its day. It's
created business as usual, which

643
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,679
means, you know, if I'm in a
body and this is all it is, I

644
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,859
better get as many toys as
possible. I better make as much

645
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,799
money as possible. But then when
I get my toys and get my money,

646
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:24,799
I realize I don't really feel
much meaning or happiness or

647
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:27,859
anything. So I better get more
toys, more money, and now if I

648
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:30,739
can build a factory, I don't
care the pollution it's going to

649
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:33,319
create, because I'm going to
make so much stuff. You're going

650
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:36,259
to want my stuff because I'm put
out ads telling you you really

651
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,039
need my stuff. You buy my stuff.
I get your money. You get this

652
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:43,059
stuff, and it isn't enough for
you need to buy more stuff. So I

653
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:46,479
produce more stuff, etc. So
let's call that business as

654
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:51,999
usual, and so we're destroying
the planet with that, because

655
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:58,419
the fundamental notion of modern
culture, in that view, is the

656
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:02,043
solo self, the self. Only exists
in your body, and this

657
00:45:02,043 --> 00:45:07,803
separation leads to so much
unconscious angst and despair

658
00:45:07,923 --> 00:45:10,923
that it's driven to a
materialistic acquisition

659
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:14,463
approach to meaning in life,
which is totally unsatisfying

660
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:17,883
and becomes a kind of addiction
to things that completely make

661
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:22,699
you feel unsatisfied, but you
keep that path. So yeah, the

662
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:26,599
notion that we could actually
have this quantum change,

663
00:45:26,779 --> 00:45:30,439
quantum would mean, yeah, a big
change, but literally from a

664
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:33,199
scientific point of view, it
means getting out of the

665
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:38,719
Newtonian illusion of a separate
self, which, unfortunately in

666
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,959
modern culture, we're going to
name, could be actually a lethal

667
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:50,919
lie. So this becomes more than,
Oh, Chris, your explorations of,

668
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:54,879
you know what matters in your
own LSD journeys, or for Michael

669
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:59,679
Pollan, who was new to it, you
know, to say, look, all these

670
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,239
things basically get you in
touch with love, and that's one

671
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:06,179
of the most common things people
say in the hub of the wheel. So

672
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:09,059
I was teaching in a parliament
once, and they were having all

673
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:11,759
sorts of tension, so they had me
do a day long workshop with the

674
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:14,939
parliamentarians. And, you know,
we did the wheel of awareness.

675
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:17,999
And during the break, everyone's
having snacks, and one of the

676
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:21,559
parliamentarians comes over and
she goes, Dan, you know I didn't

677
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:24,679
share during the sharing time? I
said, Yeah, I noticed. He goes,

678
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:29,239
Do you want to know why I didn't
share? I said, Sure. Why didn't

679
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:32,179
you share? He goes, Do you know
that part of the wheel practice

680
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:35,299
when you bend the spoke around
into the hub? I said, Yeah, I

681
00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:39,679
know that part. And he goes. And
he slows down. His eyes get

682
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:47,799
filled with tears. And he goes,
I have never felt so much love

683
00:46:47,799 --> 00:46:52,299
before in my life. I've never
felt so connected to to everyone

684
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:57,879
and everything. There's this
silence. And I said, so you

685
00:46:57,879 --> 00:47:01,619
didn't want to share that. And
he goes, Oh no, no. He goes, if

686
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,579
I said, Love they and he points
over to his parliamentarian

687
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:09,659
colleagues. He said they would
think I was weak. So then his

688
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:11,939
silence were just kind of
staring at each other. His eyes

689
00:47:11,939 --> 00:47:15,299
are all welled up with tears,
and I said, I get it. You didn't

690
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,939
want to appear weak. He goes,
No, no. I said, So can I ask you

691
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:21,979
a question? He goes, Sure. I
said, so when you're making

692
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:27,739
federal law, when you're making
national policies, are you

693
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:29,599
leaving love out of the
reasoning?

694
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,599
And then his eyes get really,
really big, and he goes, and he

695
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,259
runs over to them. Right now,
this is guy who never meditated

696
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:43,239
before in his life. I'm you
know, this experience was new

697
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:46,719
for him, obviously, from what he
was saying, but you can only

698
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:51,159
imagine that this not being in
touch with this core aspect,

699
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:54,939
which feels like it's a thread
of the tapestry of reality, that

700
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:59,859
love is this vital force, that
if people in positions of power,

701
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:02,999
like a parliamentarian at a
country you know, think love is

702
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:07,619
weak, you know, then we're in
trouble. You know, we're in deep

703
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:11,639
trouble. So the idea, then, of,
you know, in this case, it's the

704
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,779
wheel of awareness, but even
just the concept that, you know,

705
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:21,019
we can actually tap into this
deeper source of awareness that

706
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:25,159
has love at its core. I'm very
hopeful that we can actually

707
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:28,579
turn this around in time. I know
we have a very brief window of

708
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:33,979
time, probably less than a
decade, and so there's an

709
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:38,119
urgency to this. But while
there's an urgency to it, it's

710
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,219
an ancient message that somehow
modern culture has ignored. So

711
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,579
my deepest hope is that adding a
little bit of the science to

712
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:49,779
say, hey, you know, this is the
problem, and maybe, as a

713
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:53,319
physician, I say, Look, if
someone comes in to me and has

714
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:56,199
pain in the bottom of their foot
and they're limping, and I go,

715
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,239
what's going on? They go, I
don't know. I have a pain in the

716
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,659
bottom of my foot. I'm limping.
I say, Here, come, come here.

717
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:04,859
Let me take off your shoe. Let
me take off your sock. Let me

718
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:09,899
look at the sole of your feet,
and let me Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa,

719
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:13,019
there's a splinter. Will you let
me take the splinter out. Oh,

720
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:16,379
there's a splinter. Yeah. Take
the splinter out. And now they

721
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:18,839
walk straight. Their back isn't
hurting anymore. The pain is

722
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:22,699
gone. We have a splinter in
modern culture, in the soul of

723
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:28,099
society, that is the separate
self. And my deepest hope is

724
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:31,459
that this conversation about
interconnectedness and we, you

725
00:49:31,459 --> 00:49:33,859
know, this me plus we, is you
don't have to get rid of the

726
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:36,319
individual. You don't have to
you don't have to crash in the

727
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,619
traffic intersection. You could
say, I have an individual body.

728
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:44,379
That's good. That's a me. And we
added we integrate it with we

729
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:47,379
and you make them we word, or
how are we going to say that in

730
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:52,059
different languages? And then we
has a way to liberate you from

731
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:55,839
the lie of the separate self and
allows us to actually find a new

732
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,239
way to go to the great turning
this movement at Joanna. Macy

733
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:03,779
would say, is away from the
great unraveling, and can let us

734
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:06,899
to go away from business as
usual. And I think everyone's

735
00:50:06,899 --> 00:50:07,739
going to be better for

736
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,140
Bernard Beitman: it. Yeah, yeah.
And

737
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:13,859
Chris Bache: the country state
that beautifully, Dan, just so

738
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:16,019
beautifully, absolutely
beautifully.

739
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Bernard Beitman: The
contribution of awareness of

740
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,492
meaningful coincidences is that
the primary kind of meaningful

741
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:29,332
coincidence is mind, thinking of
something, imagining something.

742
00:50:29,752 --> 00:50:34,012
It happens in the environment,
and it begins to show us in

743
00:50:34,012 --> 00:50:38,992
individual daily life that mind
and environment are connected,

744
00:50:39,112 --> 00:50:43,000
that we are not separate from
each other. We are not separate

745
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,620
from our surroundings. Being
able to, like, sing a song,

746
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,700
which I was singing along a
river, yeah, the other day, and

747
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,420
I like 50 songs, and I was
hitting like a low note, 1010,

748
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:02,100
or low note, and right then I
hear a harmonic very much like

749
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:08,160
the note I am singing as hey,
it's joining me in this song.

750
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,520
And it was, it turned out to be
a truck going across the river,

751
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,940
the river I was nearby. But the
experience of having the

752
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,360
external join what appeared to
be the internal is a sort of

753
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,760
thing that, for some of us is a
slow but persistent daily

754
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,260
reminder of mind being connected
with environment. The basic

755
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:33,500
message of which is, we have to
dissolve our reliance on the

756
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,640
belief of a separate self, and
then what do we have left? And

757
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,880
so the message from from you,
Dan particularly, and I think

758
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,820
Chris too, is, how do we help
people recognize their inter and

759
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:50,920
intra connectedness so they can
find the love that's all around

760
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,440
us? There's love all around but
I never heard it singing, no. I

761
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,080
mean, there's a love all there,
and it's so much fun to be in it

762
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,740
and all its many variations. One
of the troubles I've been having

763
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,620
is there's so many different
kinds of love that we can

764
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:12,420
experience a gradient of them,
and it's fun to try to do

765
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,100
various of them. So being able
to get out there and connect.

766
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,680
Dan, would you? Would you
separate out for this listener,

767
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,600
hear me interconnected versus
interconnected? Sure.

768
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:30,379
Dan Siegel: Well, the origin of
that word, you know, I was

769
00:52:30,379 --> 00:52:34,519
working with these systems
scientists at MIT, and we, we

770
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:39,799
went on a retreat together to
deepen our experiential sense of

771
00:52:39,859 --> 00:52:44,199
systems. So we were up in the
Colorado mountains with John P

772
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:48,159
Milton at the way of nature. And
part of that retreat process is

773
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:53,199
to go for three days by your
individual selves in the forest.

774
00:52:53,499 --> 00:52:56,559
So, you know, we had our
experience, and we came out

775
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,199
after the three days, and we're
together. And everyone was

776
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,219
saying these beautiful
experiences they had, of being

777
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:05,099
interconnected with the forest,
of being interlaced with the

778
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,459
forest interwoven. They used
Thich Nhat Hanh, beautiful term

779
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:12,059
inter being. And then it came
time for me in the circle to

780
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:15,419
speak. And I'm I'm kind of a
particular person for the

781
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:18,479
meaning of words. And I said,
you know, I resonate with

782
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:22,999
everything you're saying,
everybody but the experience for

783
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:27,019
this body was not so much a
betweenness. It was like a

784
00:53:27,019 --> 00:53:32,659
within this. I mean, I was the
creek, I was the tree, I was the

785
00:53:32,659 --> 00:53:39,199
sky, I was the body called Dan.
There was a within this to it, I

786
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,559
don't know, I couldn't say
interconnected, because there

787
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:45,939
wasn't a separation of me
connected to that. So I guess I

788
00:53:45,939 --> 00:53:48,459
would say interconnected, and
everyone's like nodding, fine,

789
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:52,059
fine. We went back to the, you
know, the place we were staying,

790
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:55,659
and back to technology. I turned
on my computer, I want to take

791
00:53:55,659 --> 00:53:58,479
some notes on the three day
experience, and I kept on

792
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:01,199
writing. Well, you know, I was
interconnected, and the word

793
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:04,499
processor auto correct, kept on
changing it back to

794
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:07,379
interconnected. So I said,
What's wrong with my computer?

795
00:54:07,379 --> 00:54:10,979
And then I looked it up. There
is no such word as intra

796
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:15,359
connected. You know,
connectedness of within. And so

797
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:19,379
I just had the feeling that, you
know, if we don't have a word to

798
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:24,679
speak from the perspective and
and speak on behalf of in terms

799
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:28,339
of agency, or even the
subjective feeling of the whole

800
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:32,119
then we've got a problem in, at
least in English, but it turns

801
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:34,159
out, there really isn't a word
like that in many other

802
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:39,019
languages. So So then I thought,
you know, I need to write some

803
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:45,219
kind of appeal to our human
family, that modern culture, at

804
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:49,959
least in the way we experience
it now, you know, has created

805
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:53,139
this experience where the self
is only separate, so that would

806
00:54:53,139 --> 00:54:55,719
be interconnected.
Interconnected means, you know,

807
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:58,419
the three of us are here, and
there's connections between us.

808
00:54:58,419 --> 00:55:00,839
That's the inter and there's
connections. Connections, and

809
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,119
that's beautiful too. So it's
it's better to have

810
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,939
interconnection than no
connection. But we need to take

811
00:55:05,939 --> 00:55:09,899
it one step further to realize
we can speak on behalf of the

812
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:13,859
experience of the whole the
whole forest and whatever life.

813
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,660
Bernard Beitman: What I get from
just your riff there is. I like

814
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:23,660
going from intra to Inter. I
like the connection and the

815
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,500
separate. It's all. I'm part of
it. It's part of me. And then I

816
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,320
get to experience myself as
somewhat separate, but still

817
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:30,860
connected

818
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,260
Dan Siegel: Exactly, and that's
exactly Bernie. The idea of

819
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,340
integration is you have a me and
a body, and no one is saying,

820
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,620
Get rid of it. And then you have
a we in a relationality. So

821
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,500
there's an inner and an inter,
and when you put the inner and

822
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,980
the inter together, it's the
intra, right? So, so that's a

823
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:51,280
way of just wording it. And what
was fun about writing the book

824
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,560
is, you know, to take the reader
on a kind of journey together,

825
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,540
looking at lifespan development,
so looking at the science of

826
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,940
self and how it develops. You
know, in utero, in in infancy,

827
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,600
in toddlerhood, in the early
years of school and adolescence

828
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,200
and adulthood, what's the
resistance to change and really

829
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,080
trying to review, not in an
academic way, but just in a

830
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,620
useful way, like what is
practical about what science has

831
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,540
said? So it was like a synthesis
of a whole bunch of science in a

832
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,980
very short way, to say, here's
what happens across the lifespan

833
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:35,840
in modern culture, to actually
be developing the false view of

834
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,980
a noun, like separate self
entity. And then here are the

835
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,780
opportunities to actually open
that up, not getting rid of the

836
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,980
individual, but realizing you
are inner, you are inter and you

837
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,020
are the wholeness of it all the
intra.

838
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,820
Bernard Beitman: Yeah, Chris,
Chris,

839
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,720
Chris Bache: uh, just beautiful.
Again. This has been, of course,

840
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,800
the the ancient message of the
spiritual traditions, and now

841
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,000
the scientific voice you're
saying is joining that chorus

842
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,720
with its own particular
epistemology. But the core

843
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:12,180
message is the finite self is a
limited self. Is not an ultimate

844
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,260
self. It's a functional self,
the contextual self, or as the

845
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,440
Buddha saw in his night of
awakening, he awoken and saw a

846
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,420
self not anywhere in the world,
not in him, not in anyone else,

847
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,020
and in anything else. And one,
when one enters this deeply into

848
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:31,820
transparency, as you say,
interconnected is just too small

849
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:36,200
for it interconnected. It's it's
a wholeness of life where the

850
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,440
the beginning and ending of my
life dissolves completely in the

851
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,020
beginning and ending of all
other lives, and one lost, in or

852
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:50,440
not, lost or dissolved into the
communion of life in its

853
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,520
totality, functioning in its
beautiful individuality and yet

854
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:01,080
incredibly complex and balanced
harmony in community to

855
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,760
experience that, if we can
stabilize that experience, if we

856
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,240
can tap into that experience and
generalize that experience and

857
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,720
make it part of our living
culture, then we really have a

858
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:18,120
foundation for a very different
culture on this planet. And I so

859
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:23,060
encouraged by your description,
Dan, and and I also think that

860
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,340
this is happening at a kind of a
another level, where I think all

861
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:31,940
of our former lives, which live
within us in the various ways,

862
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,280
just we carry the history of the
planet in our soul. We've been

863
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,700
every race. We've been every
religion, with every variation,

864
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,640
and as the planet is coming into
this cataclysmic process of

865
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,560
compression, we are psychically
coming into this inner process

866
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:58,300
of compression. And I think that
this transition into a quantum

867
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,940
sense of self, a quantum sense
of wholeness a quantum

868
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,860
entanglement. And I love that,
that word from, you know, Dean

869
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:14,580
Radin in his book, and entangled
mind. I think we're coming into

870
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,360
a compression point in history
where it's just like extinction

871
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,560
is an evolutionary driver, and
it's a very powerful I think

872
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:26,480
you're right, that the ego, this
is a civilization, a culture,

873
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,780
that's been built on the the
ego, and which is a beautiful

874
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,680
structure, but it's it's a it's
an imprisoned self, and it leads

875
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,120
and builds a divided world. And
we don't have the luxury of a

876
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:44,140
planet any longer being guided
by an egoic civilization, even a

877
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,320
well intentioned egoic
civilization, we need to give

878
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,860
birth to a higher, more
inclusive form of human

879
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:54,280
identity, which I think this
inclusiveness that you're

880
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,680
pointing to Dan also correlates
with an escalated intensity of a

881
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,600
sense. Enter integration, so
that what I call the diamond

882
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:10,800
soul isn't is a summation
individuality, but it also is

883
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:14,760
because its very nature. It's
also a transparent

884
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:20,100
individuality. It's open to the
field. It lives in constant

885
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:30,800
feedback with the field, it's I
don't have any the faster we

886
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,880
move through this crisis, the
better, the more we all begin to

887
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,480
understand what's happening and
align ourselves with becoming

888
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,460
the kind of being that history
needs us to be at all those

889
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:46,480
levels, then the fewer children
have to die, the fewer

890
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,700
grandchildren will have to die.
I guess I see this price of this

891
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:55,300
crisis deepening for decades,
not on the basis of psychedelic

892
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,960
visionary not not at all, but
just in terms of what the

893
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,580
environmentalists are telling us
in the crisis that they seem

894
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:08,280
kind of coming at us. But I do
think, I do think it is about

895
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:12,180
releasing something splendid in
the human heart. It's about

896
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:17,100
actualizing our divine potential
in a higher order, a higher

897
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:22,580
register, same divine being,
same cosmic nature, but

898
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,840
actualized into a higher self
expression. And I just am so and

899
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:31,820
I take such strength in your
description, Dan, it's really, I

900
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,340
feel such deep resonance with
it. It's a

901
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,100
Bernard Beitman: real, well,
good. I thought you might,

902
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:45,160
Chris, and you have, and you do,
and I'm just like, looking at my

903
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,480
next dance step, you know, I
kind of, I mean, I can be fairly

904
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,040
academic. I've done it that that
a long time, but the next dance

905
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:59,020
step I see is somehow being able
to facilitate not only the

906
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:03,000
recognition, but the experience
of the Self as being part of

907
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,120
something greater. It's not just
this me, it's me, and it's me

908
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,680
with others. It's me with
nature. It's me with this whole

909
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,280
planet. It was with me with
Gaia. I am part of it, and you

910
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,920
are part of it, and we are all
part of it. And have that

911
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,240
experience, and I like the
differentiations that come out

912
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,600
with doing that, that there's
some, there's some, there's

913
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:31,580
there's, there's centers of
intra connectedness. A family is

914
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:36,140
a center of of a mind, that of
which each person is a part, for

915
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:39,500
example, or a group. And again,
it dances, where I get to

916
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,000
experience that sometimes. So
what we're as we come to the end

917
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,400
of this, I really, whether you
guys like it or not, I don't see

918
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,300
this as just the end of anything
here. I think it's a beginning

919
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:55,720
here we've got, and it's been
going on for a while anyway, but

920
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,020
here we are, the three of us
talking about this, and we've

921
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,520
got to dissolve the self, at
least temporarily, to be able

922
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,420
to, like, modulate that. It's
just me thing, which is

923
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,960
defensive right now. I mean,
people are doing it now, being

924
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,780
scared. There's a lot of reasons
to do that. I, and you've

925
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:15,660
described very well, I don't
have to try to do that. But our

926
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,320
mission, each of us, in our own
way, I think, is to be able to

927
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,960
help that singular, singular
identity of self is separate

928
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:28,460
from everything else, begin to
have an oscillation between self

929
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,240
and environment. And I think
that's what we're doing. I think

930
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,520
that's a mission we're all on in
some way or other, in our own

931
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,300
ways, with our own songs and
with our own dance and our own

932
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:45,700
people and our own way of doing
it, and each of you have that as

933
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,900
what you're doing, and I'm so
glad that we've been able to at

934
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,460
least get a touch of it. So I
thank each of you for for

935
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,940
joining me in this discussion
and clarifying something I kind

936
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:01,440
of knew, but making it clear for
people who are listening to us

937
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,240
that this singular ego thing has
to be replaced with something a

938
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,180
little more broad, but still,
the integration is part of the

939
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,200
vacillation. So I'm we'll end
this with each of you having

940
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,760
some closing comment, and then
we'll, we'll stop So Dan,

941
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,260
Dan Siegel: no, it's beautiful
to be here with you, Chris and

942
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,580
Bernie, as you know it sits.

943
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:36,380
It's a moment in our human
evolution when I think if we

944
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:42,160
realize that a process that is
really established, called

945
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:48,400
cultural evolution. Yeah, it's
very real, and everyone can have

946
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,240
participation in something
called pervasive leadership,

947
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:57,520
where every individual can take
whatever role fits with your

948
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:06,240
life to find a way. To to sense
into a self that yes is inside.

949
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,960
That's the inner Yes, that's
connected to other people and to

950
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,740
nature Yes. But that also,
besides inner and inter is

951
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:18,900
intra, and this is the me plus
we. Is we, you know, term and

952
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:24,260
what? What I invite everyone
listening to just consider is

953
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:30,920
that cultural evolution happens
by one person, one relationship,

954
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,940
one conversation at a time.
People often quote Margaret

955
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:38,720
Mead, the anthropologist is
saying, you know, don't ever

956
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,580
think that a small group of
people can't change the world,

957
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,460
because, indeed, that's the only
thing that ever has. So if we

958
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,820
can just have that pervasive
leadership now, you know, with

959
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,920
the grounding in indigenous
wisdom and contemplative

960
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,600
teachings from 1000s of years,
and with the additional, you

961
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,800
know, support of modern views
from science, you know, we

962
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,220
actually can take the steps we
need in the time we can do it.

963
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:14,520
So the issue is not whether we
can or can't, because we can

964
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,720
this cultural evolution can
happen very rapidly. The bigger

965
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,380
question is,

966
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:24,140
Bernard Beitman: will we and we
will, because we have to, well,

967
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,560
that's, I'm with you. That's a
big driver. That's a big driver

968
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,560
keep those grandchildren around
being able to do their thing.

969
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:34,820
That's because we're, we're part
of trying to make that happen,

970
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:35,720
Chris,

971
01:06:36,739 --> 01:06:39,139
Chris Bache: but Dan, I would
just underscore everything you

972
01:06:39,139 --> 01:06:42,939
just said, and put my initials
right beside it, because I

973
01:06:42,939 --> 01:06:46,899
certainly believe everything
you've said. One of the things

974
01:06:46,899 --> 01:06:51,939
that was shown me along the way
was you talked about fields and

975
01:06:51,939 --> 01:06:57,159
quantum fields and and part of
my experience was at one point

976
01:06:57,399 --> 01:07:00,899
that the intensity of the global
crisis we're coming into is

977
01:07:00,899 --> 01:07:04,799
going to hyper stimulate not
only our individual fields, but

978
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,219
the collective field of
humanity. So it's going to drive

979
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:11,939
it into non linear conditions.
We know something about how

980
01:07:11,939 --> 01:07:15,419
physical fields behave in non
linear conditions, chaos theory.

981
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:20,039
Now if we make the assumption
that the psychic field of

982
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:24,259
humanity under non linear
behavior, far from equilibrium

983
01:07:24,259 --> 01:07:27,379
conditions, will have some of
those same qualities. Then we

984
01:07:27,379 --> 01:07:30,319
have a way of looking at
emergence coming out of the

985
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,859
depths of the human psyche, new
the emergence of new forms,

986
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:37,399
crystallizations of that weren't
even available previously, but

987
01:07:37,399 --> 01:07:42,099
represent an actualization of
latent capacities within human

988
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,639
nature. So that feels deeply
aligned with what you're talking

989
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:48,639
about, and it helps us
understand how we can make as

990
01:07:48,759 --> 01:07:52,239
big a change as we need to make
in as short a time as we have,

991
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:58,179
because in in the instability of
of a, of a when we come to trick

992
01:07:58,179 --> 01:08:01,559
uh, trigger points, bifurcation
systems, of course, very

993
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:04,739
susceptible to small
perturbations, so that the

994
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:07,979
influence of individuals
increases the more we move into

995
01:08:07,979 --> 01:08:11,639
a period of crisis that gives
added weight to each one of our

996
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:17,519
effects on the outcome. And
yeah, that's and I just, I just

997
01:08:17,519 --> 01:08:18,899
really support what you're
saying.

998
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,400
Bernard Beitman: Yeah, that's
really good, really good. So

999
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,540
hopefully those listening to
this and watching us will be

1000
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:33,920
part of joining us and trying to
be able to facilitate the intra

1001
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,060
connection that's also
interconnected and also about us

1002
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:43,240
individually. So thank you both
for joining me today. It's been

1003
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,140
a great discussion.

1004
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,660
Chris Bache: Thank you, Bernie,
thank you for getting us

1005
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,020
together.

1006
01:08:47,739 --> 01:08:49,899
Dan Siegel: Thank you Bernie,
Thank you, Chris. Great to be

1007
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:54,159
with you all. And this is a it's
an exciting moment, and we can

1008
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:55,899
do this. Yes, is

1009
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,039
Unknown: our mental is our
mental atmosphere,

1010
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:08,399
Dan Siegel: like an hologram

1011
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,500
Unknown: of cosmic
consciousness.

1012
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,180
Oh, you.

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,740
Unknown: Hi everybody, welcome.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,020
Rachel Fleming: Lovely to see
you wherever you are in the

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,940
world, it's a beautiful evening
here in Devon, England, so thank

4
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,740
you so much for joining us
tonight. You could be out in the

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,480
sunshine, but it's lovely to see
you. And welcome to anyone who

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,680
is watching on the recording,
and I think there will be quite

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,860
a few of those. So we are
talking about contemporary

8
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,540
animism tonight. This is a talk
in our contemporary animism

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:02,940
program. We are really delighted
to show you an interview that we

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,980
did some time ago with a chap
called Chris Bache Colin. Is

11
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,640
going to introduce him a bit
more in depth, but just to say

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,720
that he took part in our
contemporary animism Confluence

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,980
back in February, and we just
thought that what he had to say

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:28,220
was just so hopeful at a moment
when we as a species, as a

15
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,940
community of species, are
looking at a fairly dark night

16
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,260
of the soul with all the climate
change news and social crises,

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,800
and it just seems that that
Chris's vision is just one of

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,600
hope, and we really hope you'll
enjoy it. What we're going to do

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,920
tonight is basically play you
the interview. It's quite heady.

20
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,080
I'll just warn you, there's a
lot of talking, and it goes for

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,780
about 15 minutes. And what we'd
really like to do is for you to

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,660
watch it, to go in and out of it
as you like, and then to stay

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,140
with us for 1015, minutes
afterwards, if you're

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,400
interested, to and just share
some of your feelings, the stuff

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,260
that might have come up for you
as you were watching it, just to

26
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,180
See whether you Yes, you like
it, whether you're excited as

27
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,360
us, or whether it's not for you.
So without further. ADO Colin,

28
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,300
can I, can I ask you to
introduce Chris also, just to,

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,560
just to give you the logistics
of Chris, he is a professor of

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,820
theology, retired from one of
the American universities, and

31
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,180
he's the author of several
books, all of which are

32
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,860
wonderful. The first one is
about reincarnation. The second

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,720
one is called dark night, early
dawn, which was fantastic. And

34
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,260
his most recent one, and the one
that he will be talking about

35
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,520
tonight, describes his research
method, which he'll tell you

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,500
more about, called LSD in the
mind of the universe. Colin,

37
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,220
over to you.

38
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,699
Colin Campbell: Thanks, Rachel.
Good evening, everyone. Yeah. I

39
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:22,279
mean, I don't almost know where
to start, because, well, let me

40
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:26,239
start by saying this. It was
about, I think, a year ago, a

41
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,639
little more relatively recently,
I stumbled upon the title, dark

42
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,919
night, early dawn. And I was
particularly struck by the

43
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,359
subtitle, which is steps towards
a new ecology of mind. And that

44
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:43,959
for me, just rang massively, and
I simply had to get a hold of

45
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,839
this book and read it, just
because of that, because,

46
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:50,319
because that's just such a huge
passion of mine, in the sense

47
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,179
that I think that what we are in
search of in These times and

48
00:03:55,179 --> 00:04:03,599
amid the very particular
conundrums and transformations

49
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:11,219
and all that we're up against in
both crisis and other terms, as

50
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:17,939
a human collective, what we're
faced with is a kind of a RE, a

51
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,519
redo of what we conceive of as
our relationship with existence,

52
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,019
with life, with the rest of the
natural world and so on. So the

53
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,199
idea of a new ecology of mine
really appealed to me. And I

54
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,939
must say, I wasn't disappointed
by the book. It really, I think

55
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,599
it's a it's a seminal piece, to
be very honest. I think, you

56
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,839
know, he was saying some really
profound things, and things

57
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,419
which are very close to my heart
as well, in terms of finding

58
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:56,859
ways into, in an experiential
way, reinvigorating much of what

59
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:02,099
we've lost over over the i.
During the process of kind of

60
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:05,279
secularization,
industrialization, globalization

61
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,219
and so on, finding a way of of
re entering, re accessing that

62
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:16,079
and revivifying it, bring it,
bringing it back into our into

63
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,359
into being, part of our kind of
search for what Being human

64
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:25,279
means now and here forward, you
know, and I was, you know, for

65
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:30,799
me, there are lots of ways of,
kind of entering into this, but

66
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:34,819
of course, the primary way of
exploring into it is to is to

67
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:39,559
kind of delve deeply into what
it means to be human. And part

68
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:43,479
of the problem we sit with
presently is that we're so

69
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,839
drastically distracted in the
world that we've created for

70
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,619
ourselves presently. And I mean
by that the primarily the

71
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:58,419
industrialized world, we're so
distracted, you know, by our

72
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:02,879
outer concerns that our inner
environment, or what we broadly

73
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,459
refer to as our inner
environment, and what I would

74
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,359
call our pre industrial
ancestry, which, of course, is

75
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:15,299
dynamically within us, but has
somehow fallen beneath the level

76
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:19,739
of our everyday interactive
awareness. You know, where that

77
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:25,039
that, unfortunately, as we
question this, this conundrum of

78
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,899
how we move forward as a
species, how we re negotiate our

79
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:33,139
relationship with the nest, the
rest of the natural world, how

80
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:40,779
we confront, or at least engage
with some of the more dramatic

81
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:45,459
crises that we face as a
humanity now, you know, we need

82
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:51,219
to, we need to find ways of
bringing back. What I conceive

83
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:55,419
of is that as that part of us
that has been sequestered off,

84
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,839
that pre industrial aspect of
who we are there, which has kind

85
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,839
of been labeled regressive and,
you know, primitive and all

86
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,279
sorts of names that we use, in a
sense, to sublimate it and

87
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,419
trivialize it and depreciate it
and throw it out of the the kind

88
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,319
of, I don't quite know what to
call it, but the engagement with

89
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,679
where we're at and so, you know,
when I came across Chris's work,

90
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:27,679
and I've read some of his
subsequent work, and of course,

91
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:32,899
before that, I was a great
follower of Stan Grof work, out

92
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:38,179
of which a lot of Chris's work
comes, you know, I just think

93
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:45,579
that this is an incredibly
important way of delving into an

94
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:50,499
a radical way. I also say I'm
very deeply of the belief that

95
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,419
our engagement right now with
the state that we find ourselves

96
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:02,279
in as a humanity requires a
radical, potent engagements. You

97
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,719
know, we can't really afford to
dabble around on the edges of

98
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,979
things. So if we're going to
look at finding contemporized

99
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,039
forms of our pre industrial
ancestry, if we're going to look

100
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,479
at experiential exploration,
deep delving into who we are,

101
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,919
what we are, and our broken
relationships with the natural

102
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,859
world. There has to be a
radicalness to this, because

103
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:30,619
it's urgent. It's desperate, in
fact, and and so you know, with

104
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:34,939
Grof work, and with with Chris's
writing subsequently, and his

105
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:39,919
experimentation and exploration,
his deep and profound, in my

106
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,339
opinion, courage in the way he's
gone in, I think this is just,

107
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:51,519
you know, it's such a profound
part of what we are, certainly

108
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,419
what I'm passionate about in
this time, in terms of the kind

109
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:58,719
of work that we're doing, as
Rachel said earlier In our

110
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:02,939
contemporary animism program,
and trying to rally, you know,

111
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:09,059
interest in an experiential
exploration of what re animating

112
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,679
ourselves might mean, might look
like. And I just think that, you

113
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,859
know, I think that this is what
you're going to see tonight in

114
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:21,379
this talk, is the absolute tip
of a profound iceberg. If we

115
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:26,059
could put it that way. You know,
as he it's well worth reading

116
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,839
his work. It's well worth
looking at Grof work as well.

117
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:35,719
It's very much, in my opinion, a
critical part of the kind of

118
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:39,439
exploration that I think is most
needed at this time. Pardon my

119
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:43,239
bias on this, but I really do
believe this, so that, having

120
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:48,579
been said, I'm going to pass
back to Rachel, and I'll be very

121
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:51,279
interested to hear some of your
reflections at the end. Thank

122
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,779
you, fantastic.

123
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,460
Rachel Fleming: Thank you,
Colin, so we'll dive straight

124
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,140
in. I have just asked him, so
we've just started, and I have

125
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,280
asked him. Um, just to tell us
about his research method and

126
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,280
how he how he came to the vision
that he will then tell you about

127
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,800
later on in the interview, and
how that fits into kind of the

128
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,720
animist world that we're
exploring. So it starts in the

129
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,900
middle of sentence is his first
sentence, so you've only missed

130
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,980
about two or three words, but
yes, that's where we'll start.

131
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,380
So I'm going to hand over to you
now, Gabby, and enjoy. I find

132
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,480
him very mind blowing. But see
what you think, Gabby, go. Thank

133
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,120
you. You so

134
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,180
we're not getting any sound.
GABBY I

135
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,540
I know this works because we
checked it earlier. So sorry.

136
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,240
What's the what's the problem?
Rachel, we're not getting any

137
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,560
sound on it. Is anybody getting
any sound on it. No.

138
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,460
Oh, after all, after the
introduction, that's going to be

139
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,920
disappointing if you can't hear
him.

140
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,920
Unknown: Any insights here,
because I'm not exactly sure

141
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,640
what's going on.

142
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,280
Rachel Fleming: You want to give
it another junta press go again.

143
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,340
Chris Bache: Share in the
animistic community is the

144
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:13,020
belief that nature is infused
with consciousness, fused with

145
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,880
mind and soul. And of course,
now we know how vast the

146
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:23,840
physical universe is, and the
question becomes, how large is

147
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,800
the mind of the universe? How
deep is it? And so I was just

148
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,540
out of graduate school in 1978
in my finish in philosophy of

149
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,380
religion, and I met the work of
Stanislav Grof, who many of you

150
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,040
know, one of the foremost
thinkers in the Transpersonal

151
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,480
psychology community, in the
psychedelic community, and I

152
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,440
read his book, realms of the
human unconscious, and my life

153
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,100
pivoted with that book, because
I immediately saw that his

154
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,720
research was relevant, not only
to clinical psychology, but also

155
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,200
to philosophy that it would he
was offering a method to

156
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,000
actually, safely and
systematically explore the

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
deepest levels of consciousness
we're in lay the answers to the

158
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,780
philosophical questions that I
was carrying coming out of a

159
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:19,380
training and Religious Studies.
So in 1979 I began what became a

160
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,960
20 year journey, working with
LSD, and there was a 1979 LSD is

161
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,920
what Stan had done his research
with, and that's what I chose to

162
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,740
continue with. If I were doing
it today, I would have a more

163
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,980
diversified cocktail of
Ayahuasca, civil side and more.

164
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,300
But I worked with LSD, and I
chose to work with very high

165
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:46,060
doses for reasons that are too
complicated to go into now, but

166
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,600
that had a profound impact on
the work, because it not only

167
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,340
changed how deep the wind worked
the work went, but it changed

168
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,440
how wide it went. The field of
consciousness that I took in

169
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,700
these transformational exercises
expanded with the power of the

170
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,720
state of consciousness that I
was entering to enter into these

171
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:17,760
exercises. So basically, I did
this work in standard grafian

172
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,100
protocol, totally isolated from
the world with a sitter, a

173
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,560
trained clinical psychologist,
sitter. I did it at home, in a

174
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,100
controlled environment, totally
internally focused, not in any

175
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,460
with any contact with the
outside world, amplifying the

176
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,820
states of awareness with
carefully selected music

177
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,580
designed to empower the states
of consciousness in which you

178
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,800
basically just Shatter your mind
in essentially working at these

179
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,820
levels, you just Shatter your
mind, and your mind dissolves

180
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,780
out into subtler and subtler
forms or aspects of reality, and

181
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,480
it became a. Systematic
exploration of what I think of

182
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,320
as the mind of the universe. I
hesitate to call the divine,

183
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,880
though sometimes I do. It's just
because the divine has so many

184
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,920
culturally infused qualities in
history that I'd rather avoid.

185
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,340
So I think of it as the mind of
the universe, and I did this

186
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,620
work for 20 years, always
keeping very careful records and

187
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,900
whatnot, and then I digested
those experiences for another 20

188
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,800
years, because this is these are
not immediately transparent

189
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,040
experiences. They're very
complex and interwoven, and they

190
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,380
involve many levels of reality
being orchestrated in the same

191
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,340
kind of titles that surges of
these states. And there was a

192
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,580
systematic instruction. I found
that one session more or less

193
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,060
started where the other session
stopped. When you work in this

194
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,760
systematic fashion that was
progressive deepening and

195
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,060
deepening and deepening. And so
it just took years for me to

196
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,460
understand what the universe was
showing me and where it was

197
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,780
taking me, and I was being shown
things. I mean, I always had a

198
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,580
sense of a systematic encounter
with an intelligence that was

199
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,400
orchestrating my experience in
dialog with me, not taking any

200
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,860
form, never taking any any deity
form or any archetypal form, but

201
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,060
always when pressed, dissolving
into deeper and deeper layers of

202
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,560
infinity. Anyway. So that is,
cumulatively, the story that I'm

203
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,080
telling in LSD, in the mind of
the universe.

204
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,220
Rachel Fleming: Would you say,
Chris, that this is an objective

205
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,240
reality, that if anybody that
did a similar method, I mean, I

206
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,780
think, I think what you did was
incredibly brave. But would

207
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,920
would everybody kind of reach
this unfolding that you did

208
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,800
using that method, or was that
not possible to say?

209
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,960
Chris Bache: I think I think it
is possible to say, I think Stan

210
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,640
Grof work allows us to say it,
and where he's dealing with

211
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,480
integrating the experiences of
1000s of people. And I'm only

212
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,020
talking integrating my
experiences, but my experiences

213
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,180
fit comfortably within the
larger matrix that Grof is work

214
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,340
has explored, and it's a
complicated answer, because on

215
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,420
the one hand I want to say yes,
and on the other hand, I have to

216
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,020
qualify that immediately,
because when you begin this

217
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,400
work, these substances only
amplify consciousness. They

218
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,580
don't give you an experience,
they don't take you a particular

219
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,980
place. They amplify your mind.
And because each of us has a

220
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,640
different life story, then the
mind which is amplified is

221
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,720
different, and we therefore,
when an amplified mind engages

222
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,340
the deeper mind of the universe,
what comes forward will be, in

223
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,880
the beginning, somewhat unique,
and will reflect our individual

224
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,040
history. And that's why these
substances are very helpful for

225
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,480
healing. They evoke our
unconscious, and therefore they

226
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,860
evoke our problems. And it's an
individual experience. But if

227
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,540
you keep going farther, if you
press to the limits of your

228
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,080
time, space, identity, if you
press to the limits of what your

229
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,360
individual history can hold and
go through this transformation

230
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,820
we call ego death, then you
begin to open into spiritual

231
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,380
reality, farther removed from
your own personal history, and

232
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,980
that's when the experiences
begin to overlap. That's when

233
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:44,500
they begin to converge. Now my
understanding is that spiritual

234
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,520
reality is not simply something
you enter and pluck fruit from,

235
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,760
like plucking an apple from a
tree. It's interactive. It's

236
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,780
always interactive. So there's a
participatory quality to our

237
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,440
experiences. So the mind that we
bring to the encounter access a

238
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,300
seed catalyst that crystallizes
a certain set of experiences

239
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,380
from the infinite potential of
the mind of the universe. And

240
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,040
then as we internalize those
experiences and are purified by

241
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,480
those experiences, it changes
the seed mind, and then we it

242
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,800
catalyzes an even deeper level
of secrets from the universe. So

243
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,260
it's a both and situation
participatory. But once you

244
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,760
understand the cycle of
participation, then I think the

245
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,500
universe that we discover is
coherent and consistent. My

246
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,880
universe is the same universe
that is discovered by

247
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,320
contemplative monks, the
mystical traditions, the near

248
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,060
death episode traditions. There
are degrees of depth, and then

249
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:57,400
we have to be careful, because
you can reach a point where you

250
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,080
think, Oh, this is what the
reality is. And it turns out,

251
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,620
well, no, this is what reality
is at this level of reality, but

252
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,920
you can pop that and go into a
deeper level of reality, and

253
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,960
things change a bit.

254
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,860
Rachel Fleming: One thing that I
find really exciting about your

255
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,060
work is that we talk about
practices. You know that finding

256
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,800
the right practices, to find the
cracks kind of in ourselves to

257
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,300
get back to a much more porous,
expanded way of being. And yet,

258
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,600
these practices take repetition
and tenaciousness and

259
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,540
everything, and you have used a
different method here. You've

260
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,620
used what, what one might kind
of think of as a fast track to

261
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,360
some of these experiences. I
mean, it's a very difficult

262
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,840
method, and I'm sure not one
that you would kind of recommend

263
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,040
to a lot of people, but that
that feels, for me, where the

264
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,780
excitement of your work is as
you fast tracked a lot of slower

265
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:01,080
practices and possibly got to
the edge of the map that a lot

266
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,540
of these contemplative practices
have got to I feel as though

267
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,440
you've managed to go further
than than much that I've seen

268
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,340
before on kind of what the
underlying nature of reality is.

269
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,160
Would you say that's true?

270
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,940
Chris Bache: It is a fast track,
except it's a fast track that

271
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,620
doesn't allow any bypassing. So
the fact that it's a fast track

272
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:33,500
means it's a much more intensely
concentrated track. So

273
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,680
purification, which in the
conventional spiritual path,

274
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,200
would be drawn out over years,
can take place within days, and

275
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,980
as any woman who's given birth
knows, a short labor is not

276
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,580
necessarily an easier labor.
It's just much, much more

277
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,660
intense. And this is true for
this type of practice, too. The

278
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,040
purifications that one goes
through in order to acclimate to

279
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,780
these subtler and cleaner and
clearer states of reality, those

280
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,080
purifications and
detoxifications are extremely

281
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,400
intense. I mean, they send you
in convulsions across the floor,

282
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,620
in throwing up, constantly
coming and going, and they

283
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,780
require a systematic
purification of your lifestyle,

284
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,580
just as any traditional
spiritual practice does. And I

285
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,500
want to emphasize that the
states of consciousness that I

286
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,540
touched for hours at a time, we
usually only learn about these

287
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,280
realities from the work of
contemplative mystics who have a

288
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,580
certain sense that they abide in
these realities. And I emphasize

289
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,900
that this is a practice, not of
abiding. It's a it's a temporary

290
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,340
access. It's only temporary
immersion in these states. And I

291
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,440
don't want to confuse temporary
immersion from abiding immersion

292
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,020
all honor to the Great Ones who
abide in these realities. You

293
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,080
know this is different. This is
temporary access, very, very

294
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,240
intense purification. But you
don't come away with permanent

295
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,800
access embedded in your nature
to these realities. What you

296
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,240
come away with are seeds of
Transcendence, or seed

297
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,760
experiences, which you then have
to nurture within your your

298
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,000
daily spiritual practice. You
have to nurture them within your

299
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,680
embodied, physical existence.
And I also want to mention that

300
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,200
these practices in the earlier
times in history have tended to

301
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,360
be associated with the
dissociative spirituality. So

302
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,780
the goal was to get up into
Transcendence and get away from

303
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,080
Earth, you know. So these are
the up and out cosmologies of

304
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,320
the last five Axial Age,
religions in the last 5000

305
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,520
years, the cosmology that
emerged in my work is very

306
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,840
different. It wasn't about
getting Transcendence. It was

307
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,520
Transcendence and service of
incarnation, Transcendence and

308
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,840
service of deeper integration.
It was about opening up and

309
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,500
letting in as much of the
universe as possible, and then

310
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,020
going through the
transformations that would allow

311
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,880
this energy to live in the
historical body, and giving me,

312
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,840
at one point, insights into
where the evolutionary

313
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,520
intelligence was taking the
human family as a whole. I began

314
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,700
this work thinking in terms of a
personal model of

315
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,780
transformation, but things
happen that just shattered that

316
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,860
model, and I began to understand
that I was had been drawn into a

317
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,800
collective transformation, and
that my my so called individual

318
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,960
work, was part of a collective
process, which then naturally

319
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,540
yielded some insights into our
collective family, human family,

320
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,280
evolutionary trajectory,

321
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,300
Rachel Fleming: fantastic, and I
want to ask you that. That in

322
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,480
great depth in a minute. Because
for me, that's kind of the

323
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,820
exciting thing that you
discovered, if you like. But

324
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,380
first of all, I'd love to ask
you about the aliveness and

325
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,680
intelligence in the universe.
Then we are talking about the

326
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,480
aliveness and intelligence in
everything around us, you know,

327
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,160
and humans being just one load
of that that just kind of as is

328
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,720
everything an animate world and
animate universe. I just

329
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,600
wondered if you could summarize
your understandings of the

330
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,700
aliveness in the universe and
how layered that is, and how

331
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,200
deep that goes, how big it is,
yes, what did you

332
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,640
Unknown: What did you mean?

333
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,060
Chris Bache: Oh, you're asking a
lot, because, you know, the

334
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,320
universe is so vast, and the
mind of the universe has so many

335
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,900
layers to it, and those layers
are, of course, all complexly

336
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,340
interwoven, and it's all alive,
and it's all intelligent, and

337
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,120
it's it's everywhere we dig into
the universe, of course, we

338
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,300
discover aliveness and
intelligence. We're finding that

339
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,380
we can't dig in anywhere and not
encounter this intelligence,

340
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,260
this living intelligence. So
when you dig into the mind of

341
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,060
the universe, you find layers of
intelligence operating there.

342
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,580
There are layers of intelligence
operating in the biosphere,

343
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,480
operating in the incarnational
rhythms of a planet I began to

344
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,760
experience at one point, for
example, reincarnation, the I

345
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,740
had gone into, sorry to cut so
many corners here, but there's

346
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,920
no way to do it except jump into
it, go into states of

347
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:56,020
consciousness in which time was
radically dilated, not eternity,

348
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,020
not timelessness, but radical
dilations of time and dilations

349
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:06,840
of personal boundaries, so
dissolving into my human family,

350
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,320
becoming the human family, and
from that perspective,

351
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,260
experiencing reincarnation, the
pulse of reincarnation, taking

352
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,700
place, All of us together as a
single organism, incarnating

353
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,740
generation by generation. And I
experienced whole lifetimes,

354
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,120
incarnating in generations,
living their lives, dying and

355
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,840
returning into the spiritual
reality. And there was an

356
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,720
intelligence to this entire
process, so that all of our what

357
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,500
I had previously thought of as
individual karma, individual

358
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,740
challenging, individual
transformation. All of our

359
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,140
individual karma was part of a
vast network of exquisitely

360
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:59,800
tuned collective karma, and our
and history was expressing the

361
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,720
rhythms of collective
transformation through the

362
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,100
medium of our individual
transformation, just one

363
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,340
example, and then going deeper,
beginning to experience the

364
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,040
pulse of the entire universe as
a single living organism. And

365
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,980
when you when you dissolve it
into that level of oneness. You

366
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,700
know, the Buddhist have a word
for it. They talk about Nirvana,

367
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,820
blown out. Self is blown out, or
Shunyata, emptiness of self.

368
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,500
When you experience the world as
one in any scale, then you

369
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,240
experience that there are no
permanent boundaries between

370
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,680
yourself and the world. So
literally, there is no private

371
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:54,940
self. And so the self kind of
pops and life runs through you.

372
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,560
You run through life, and the
whole of life breathes as one.

373
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,640
It breathes together. As
Plotinus said, So, everywhere

374
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,320
you touch it, the world is
intelligent. At the very end of

375
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,980
my journey, in the 70th session,
out of 73 I did 73 sessions. In

376
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,540
the 70th session, I was taken
deep, deep, deep into what I

377
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,260
call deep time, farther into
time than I'd ever been, taken

378
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,120
before and given a series of
visions. And one of those

379
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,220
visions had to do with
experiencing, in some way, from

380
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,500
my perspective and my history,
the large story of what was

381
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,540
happening in the universe, and I
experienced reincarnation. I was

382
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:50,140
experiencing the same deep
pattern, and I experienced stars

383
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,340
of light shooting out of time
and space shooting into the

384
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:00,540
universe. And I understood that
these were what I call. Diamond

385
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,980
souls. These were the fruition
of a reincarnation process

386
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:12,120
creating a diamond pure soul
that could explore the spiritual

387
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,920
world in dimensions previously
unavailable to it that time and

388
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:23,960
space was creating diamond souls
over vast periods of time, so

389
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,740
layers and layers and layers of
intelligence operating at

390
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,820
different levels.

391
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,640
Rachel Fleming: So when I read
your book, Chris, I mean, it's

392
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,320
literally mind blowing. I mean
it, it's kind of it feels as

393
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,280
though it's science fiction, or
it's in the realms of science

394
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,760
fiction, and yet, for me, there
was nothing in there that didn't

395
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,080
sound right. You know, it just
kind of has that feeling, ah,

396
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,540
yes, I understand this, and it
feels right to me. And I'd love

397
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,360
to talk to you about the
evolutionary process. You

398
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,600
touched on it a bit there, but
let's go into that in more

399
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,800
detail, but first of all
reincarnation, because that is

400
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,300
something that obviously we
don't all feel is true, but you

401
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,300
did earlier work on the subject
of reincarnation, and just

402
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,740
before we go on to the
evolutionary story that you've

403
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,100
seen, could you talk about a
little bit about reincarnation

404
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,660
and your work on this and why
you believe that that is what's

405
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,380
happening.

406
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,860
Chris Bache: Well, I did. I
wrote my first book on

407
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,500
reincarnation because I thought
it was such an essential

408
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,760
principle, because our
philosophical roads divide. If

409
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,000
you think we only are on earth
one time, but we're on Earth

410
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,560
multiple times, those need to
different visions of reality,

411
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,760
and today, I think we have
overwhelming empirical evidence

412
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,000
that reincarnation is simply
true. It's a fact of life. I

413
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,940
think Ian Stevenson at the
University of Virginia and his

414
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,180
study of young children around
the world who have spontaneous

415
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,020
memories of their most immediate
life, he's just documented

416
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,840
hundreds and hundreds of these
children. And his research has

417
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,560
been challenged, but it's still
it's holding up. And I think he

418
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,640
is the Charles Darwin of
reincarnation studies. And then

419
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,020
we have past life therapies,
people coming in, highly

420
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,680
qualified people healing, using
past life access to past life

421
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,420
memories, to heal present life
traumas. This, to me, is just an

422
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,460
empirical fact of life. So after
living, it takes a long time to

423
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,080
sort of live in a reincarnation
universe, to understand the

424
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,180
implications of the fact that
there's this pulse of life and

425
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,540
that all of us have been here
multiple times, and all of us

426
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,380
have deeper histories with
place, with people, with

427
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,980
projects, and that we're always
starting something and we're

428
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,920
continuing something in one
lifetime, and we're doing

429
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,860
something that's going to be
continued in another lifetime,

430
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,280
that this overlapping complexity
so that I don't see little

431
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,480
children as little anymore. I
don't see old people as old

432
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,500
anymore. Sometimes little
children are deeply old in

433
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,820
Seoul, and old people are
sometimes very young in Seoul,

434
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:22,460
and you just tune to a different
level. Now, I had that in the

435
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,000
early stages of my psychedelic
work. And in the early stages of

436
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,580
my psychedelic work, I was taken
into some of the nuts and bolts

437
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,620
of reincarnation and karma, and
then that became kind of ground

438
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:44,620
one as I began to be taken into
the human family and to

439
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,340
experience the human family
evolving and growing through

440
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,620
reincarnation. This, to me,
reincarnation is simply the

441
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,480
higher octave of evolution. It's
the cutting edge of evolution in

442
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,400
our particular species, where
evolution tends was trying to

443
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,560
change whole species.
Reincarnation is evolving

444
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,920
individuals within certain
species. And I don't think just

445
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,340
human species. I think somewhere
lower down the line,

446
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:21,140
reincarnation begins to turn in
just state. And then the

447
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:26,120
question becomes, well, where is
reincarnation taking us, if we

448
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,240
are reincarnating so many times,
where are we going? What's

449
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,500
what's the whole project of it?
What's the purpose of it? And to

450
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,980
determine to answer the
question, what's the purpose of

451
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,860
a reincarnating species is
complicated, because once you

452
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,000
understand that every human
being on the planet is

453
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,060
reincarnating with a purpose,
its specific purpose, then you

454
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,560
realize the full breadth of the
living experience of human

455
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,080
being, the breath of what's
being learned. That what

456
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,160
humanity is learning is just
enormous. And when we try to

457
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,300
say, well, this is the purpose
of life, we have a tendency to

458
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:13,260
sort of take a purpose that we
can identify with and maybe over

459
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,460
generalize it to encompass all
purposes. So we really have to

460
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,580
look at the whole of the human
family and gestate the whole of

461
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,360
the things that people are
learning to even begin to come

462
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,140
up with some generality that
encompasses them all you see

463
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:38,060
what I mean? So, so in some
cases, we can be learning love,

464
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,440
we can be learning generosity,
we can be learning strength of

465
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,740
self. We can be learning
physical defense. We can be

466
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,760
learning surrendering physical
defense, what one person is

467
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,080
growing into in one lifetime.
Another person may be growing

468
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,260
out of and both of them are
living their truth

469
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,800
Colin Campbell: at a process
level.

470
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,800
Chris Bache: Most of the Eastern
religions basically say, Yes,

471
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,920
you grow, you activate the
chakras. You bring higher and

472
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,860
higher levels of consciousness
online. But when your

473
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,300
consciousness opens up to divine
essence, when it opens up to the

474
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,340
you that is more real than any
of your individual, private

475
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,380
incarnational use the divine.
You the essential. You. When you

476
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,000
open up to that, then you reach
enlightenment that the Hindus

477
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,500
call moksha. Means you can
escape, you can leave. So once

478
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,680
you wake up, then let's get out
of here. There's better places

479
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,260
to be than Earth. So that's an
up, and not cosmology. But what

480
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,480
happened in my sessions was
different than that. I reached a

481
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,360
point about halfway on my
journey when all of my former

482
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,980
lives began to come into me. I
was in a again, a kind of a

483
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,020
pregnant time, reality of deep
time, and my former lives were

484
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,480
coming in and were coming in,
and it was like wrapping a

485
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,720
filament of kite string around a
spool. But that's string was

486
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,620
human experience. It was whole
human lifetimes. And they kept

487
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,320
coming together, and they
reached a critical mass. And

488
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,800
when they reached a critical
mass, they fused into one. When

489
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,040
that happened, there was a
tremendous explosion of energy,

490
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,340
and a diamond Luminosity
exploded from my chest. And

491
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,900
that's when I began to
understand, and was shown, that

492
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,540
we make progress incrementally,
lifetime by lifetime, as we

493
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,040
incarnate. But the goal is not
simply to make incremental

494
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,320
progress. The goal eventually is
that all of our lives come

495
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:58,540
infused into one and we become,
on earth, a being who has

496
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:04,200
100,000 hundreds of 1000s of
years of history in it, awakened

497
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,800
within it, and empowered within
it. That is the being that we

498
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,600
are becoming, and that is a
different kind of being than an

499
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:18,480
egoic being. It's the vast depth
of its heart is deep is bigger.

500
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,740
The breath of its mind is
bigger, the texture of its

501
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,460
social relationships is bigger,
and its relationship to nature

502
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,820
is different because it knows
that the world we leave is the

503
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:35,060
world we inherit. It has a
deeper, embodied texture of its

504
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:42,040
relationship with nature. And my
discovery was that this is not

505
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,180
simply a path of individuals.
This is simply a story of

506
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,960
individual spiritual awakening
that we are all going through

507
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,320
this transition. We are all
giving birth to the diamond

508
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,820
soul. The entire species is at a
point in its history where it

509
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,320
can no longer afford the luxury
we're trying to live on this

510
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,540
planet in the fragmented egoic
state. When the world order is

511
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:11,940
created by egos, it leads to a
fragmented order that serves

512
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,860
some and not others. But when
the soul wakes up to the with

513
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,100
the profound compassion of its
history, the soul lives on this

514
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,680
planet differently than the ego
does. And I think we are coming

515
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,160
into a very profound, tumultuous
period of history, which I think

516
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,600
of as a birth process. It will
feel like a death process, and

517
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,000
it is a death process. It's it's
basically destroying the culture

518
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,020
that was built by the ego, and
destroying the ego which built

519
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,220
that culture, and in that
process of dying to that which

520
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,360
is small, giving birth to
something new, giving birth

521
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,080
literally, to a new stage in the
human story, not on. A new body

522
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:07,680
politic and New Economics, and a
shift I think, is taking place

523
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,360
at the depths of the collective
unconscious. The plate tectonics

524
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,380
of the collective psyche are
shifting in that Jungian sense,

525
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,720
deep, deep down inside the human
psyche. This transformation is

526
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:28,340
taking place so that all human
beings who are born after this

527
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:32,600
transition will be living their
individual life within the

528
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,360
matrix of a different collective
psyche. That, I think, is the

529
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,280
work of the hour. That's what we
are working to, and part of this

530
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,080
to actualize, and part of this
is reawakening to Divine

531
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,960
Presence, which we've stripped
out of nature tried to

532
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:56,200
unsuccessfully, but reawakening
to this common ground that we

533
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,620
have with nature, to This
intelligence that surrounds us

534
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,960
and saturates us.

535
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,700
Rachel Fleming: Wow, Chris. I
mean, I'm imagining people

536
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,700
hearing this for the first time.
It's kind of difficult to get

537
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,460
your head around it. And I want
to bring what I want to bring

538
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,540
Colin in in a minute. So to
summarize, in my kind of terms,

539
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,680
and what you're talking about,
really, is, is the evolution of

540
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,900
the human species individuals
and collectively, towards a

541
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,520
position where we can remember
our entire history. So if we

542
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:34,400
take reincarnation as a given,
then we're evolving towards a

543
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,040
place where we can remember past
our past incarnations on this

544
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:46,600
earth. And, you know, Colin, can
I bring you in here? Because

545
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,780
there's something that you talk
about, you know, in reanimating

546
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:57,520
ourselves, we need to have a
completely new cognitive

547
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,180
framework. You know, that that
the the way of connecting to the

548
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,900
intelligence in the universe is
so foreign to us now that we

549
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,360
need a whole different framework
to kind of be able to wrestle

550
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,900
with with that kind of
information. What's your feeling

551
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,240
about what Chris is talking
about? I know you've read the

552
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,160
book too, and I know you love
it. So biased question here, but

553
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,840
yeah, from your perspective,

554
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,620
Colin Campbell: Thanks, Rachel.
Well, first of all, I really

555
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,680
wanted to say how much of an
honor it is to meet you, Chris.

556
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,500
I have to say the encounter with
your books, and the first one I

557
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,900
encountered was dark night,
early dawn. Was was really,

558
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:47,260
well, tectonic in nature for me,
and I'm filled with questions,

559
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,700
and was, and have been all the
way through reading your books

560
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,160
and re reading them and reading
them again, and thinking about

561
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,720
and brewing on it. And a lot of
the questions I really want to

562
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,120
ask, I have no idea how would
even articulate. I can feel them

563
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:10,080
and I can sense them, but how,
and I, you know, so, I mean, I

564
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,300
can see, feel myself at the sort
of edges, you know, of my, what

565
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,320
I call my present cognition.
Because, you know, I was, I was

566
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:26,360
lucky enough to be born into and
brought up within a traditional

567
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,640
indigenous culture here in
southern Africa. And through,

568
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,700
through my childhood, lived in
wilderness and among people who

569
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,940
had a very, very particular
relationship with wilderness and

570
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,280
a cosmology that came out of
that. And subsequently, I find

571
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,840
myself, you know, in

572
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,780
Unknown: in the

573
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:53,440
Colin Campbell: worlds of post
industrial world, trying to

574
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:59,260
reconcile that part of me with
the part of me I find myself in

575
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:06,300
now and finding that it's very
difficult to bring it feels like

576
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,300
in a certain sense, that there
are two cognitive frameworks

577
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,860
within me at some level, and
that somehow I'm tasked with

578
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,780
trying to reconcile these two
parts of myself and reading

579
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,620
reading through your books. I
you know, where I found myself,

580
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,420
find myself back into the
cognitive system, really, that I

581
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,660
grew up in, and that forms a
kind of an under structure

582
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:36,860
within my experience now and but
I mean within that, then I have,

583
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,240
I have questions. I mean loads
of them, which, which your books

584
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,740
really, really brought up in me,
and among them, among the most

585
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,040
difficult to articulate are
questions around time and and

586
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,980
the notion that somehow or
other, you know, so

587
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,920
reincarnation is not something
that really comes into the

588
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,860
cosmology is here in southern
Africa, and yet it does.

589
00:45:00,352 --> 00:45:02,752
Implicit in certain terms.

590
00:45:05,092 --> 00:45:05,932
Unknown: But I'm really

591
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:13,792
Colin Campbell: so as we look at
this idea of reincarnation, the

592
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:17,452
cognitive framework that I would
perceive it from here, as we

593
00:45:17,452 --> 00:45:22,280
speak about it, relies on a
sequence of time that speaks of

594
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:28,340
a past from which we come and a
future to which we go. But what

595
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:32,120
happens if we take that out, if,
in fact, if, in fact, that's

596
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,020
nearly my present cognitive
framework. But you know, how

597
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:42,280
would we understand
reincarnation and the notion of

598
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,620
a trajectory towards something,
if time in its kind of sequence

599
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,360
from beginning to seeming
culmination, or some such thing.

600
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,040
If that wasn't the case, yeah, I
don't know if I'm making any

601
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:58,780
sense.

602
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,360
Chris Bache: It's a good
question. If you if we eliminate

603
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,740
the arrow of time, then
reincarnation begins to look

604
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,460
like multi incarnation, not
reincarnation. Some people have

605
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,940
conceptualized as we're living
all of our lives simultaneously

606
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,920
in a and we're interacting. All
these lives are active and

607
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,940
interacting in a way that
befuddles the logic of linear

608
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,840
development, and it requires a
different kind of logic. And

609
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,380
I've tried to think in that
world multiple times, and I

610
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,760
basically keep coming down to I
can't do it. I mean, I literally

611
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,840
cannot live in a world where
Multi incarnation makes sense. I

612
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,340
can't make it make sense. Now,
another little thread Robert

613
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,800
Monroe, from the Monroe
Institute of Applied Science,

614
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,500
out of body guy you know, has
been wrote three wonderful books

615
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,560
in the out of body state,
exploring the universe daily

616
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,180
from the out of body state. He
says, You reach a point in your

617
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,920
spiritual development, where you
discover that you can incarnate

618
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,980
in any time period you wish. So
soul forward does not mean time

619
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,840
forward, right? So you can
incarnate in the 10th century

620
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,200
BC, and next you can incarnate
in the 20th century. AD, so

621
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,820
permeability of time that you
see how that continues the

622
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,960
concept of linear development,
but it flexes on the concept of

623
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,380
times, absolute linearity. For
myself, I've gone through so

624
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:41,440
many permutations of time,
moving into deep time where you

625
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,360
can I experienced my entire life
in the early stages, birth to

626
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,820
death, simultaneously present.
Absolutely. I was experiencing

627
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,540
the whole of my life, the end
and the beginning and all of its

628
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:01,680
development as a simultaneous
later. I was taken into periods

629
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,600
of time where 100,000 years were
being lived out as if it were

630
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:12,540
one minute. It's convinced me
that the universe has many

631
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:17,400
modalities of time built into
it, that when we move into

632
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,980
deeper dimensions of reality,
there are different modalities

633
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:29,000
of time that are available.
There all that which you would

634
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,420
think. And it does make me
receptive to the idea of letting

635
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,700
go of a concept of linear time
and linear development. And

636
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,740
somehow I try to reconcile the
fact that from the universe's

637
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,880
perspective, there are multiple
modalities of time, so that the

638
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:51,940
universe can show me the future
from its time which is and can

639
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,360
give me the experience of
knowing the future as something

640
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,980
which has already happened and
simultaneously which is yet to

641
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:06,000
happen, and at the same time, at
the same time, hold on to some

642
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,560
notion of the value and the
challenge of something

643
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:17,880
approximating linear
development. And I think my best

644
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,280
take is that life chops it's its
challenges to it chops the

645
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,380
learning into bits and pieces,
and we can't learn it all in one

646
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:31,880
lifetime. We can't do it all
simultaneously. It's easier if

647
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,460
it's just broken down into bits
and pieces. And if this, if this

648
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,300
challenge of linear development,
is coming to a fruition, and is

649
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,380
coming to a diamond soul, a an
awareness that holds all of its

650
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,180
time moments in its present
consciousness on Earth. This, of

651
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:56,080
course, is not the end of the
developmental story, of the

652
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,920
linear story, because in a
million years, will be far.

653
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,860
Other in a billion years, will
be farther still the universe

654
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,340
just getting warmed up, you
know, is that we have no reason

655
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:13,200
for thinking that the universe
is is in anywhere near the end

656
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,500
of its evolutionary story. We
know it's really at the early

657
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,160
stages of its story. So I think
of time is one of the great

658
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,380
gifts of evolution.
Individuality is one of the

659
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,400
great gifts of the physical
universe. Time is one of the

660
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,960
gifts of the physical universe.
Behind that lay lies

661
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,720
permutations of metaphysics that
put that are more fluid with

662
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,420
respect to time. But inside
space time, I think there is an

663
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:52,120
approximate linear arrow of time
which serves the soul's purpose,

664
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:58,720
which serves some deeper cosmic
web. And yet, at the same time,

665
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,120
when we are in the linear
development if we open up to the

666
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,200
universe, if we open up to the
universe's sense of time, we

667
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,900
often get these flashes of more
than more than the present. You

668
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:23,180
know more parallel dimensions of
time. So your question makes a

669
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,780
lot of sense, and it's, it's a
substantive question.

670
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,660
Rachel Fleming: Can I ask one
Colin, or do you want to come

671
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:38,600
back on that? Okay, so yeah,
great. This is the problem with

672
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,540
your work, Chris, we need to
keep trying to we're out in kind

673
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:50,800
of like inarticulable terrain,
aren't we, when we get to that

674
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,740
you what you call the diamond
soul, then when there's this

675
00:51:53,740 --> 00:52:00,900
moment of remembering what, what
are The other attributes, what

676
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,280
are the other kind of what does
that bring? Other than

677
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,640
remembering and wholeness? You
know, did you have an experience

678
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,420
of what else?

679
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,900
Chris Bache: Well, first of all,
I think full consciousness is

680
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:20,100
what we return to when we die.
So while we're in the Bardo

681
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:25,340
Earth, Bardo, earth, kind of
stage. When we die, we return to

682
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,240
whole consciousness. So it's not
something we're unfamiliar with.

683
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,780
It's something we are familiar
with. And then we precipitate

684
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,200
out of whole consciousness into
part consciousness, egoic

685
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,560
consciousness, and we return. So
it's a it's a constant accordion

686
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,220
kind of effect. We die as we get
large, we're born, we get small,

687
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,460
we die. We get large. We're
born, we get small sooner or

688
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,900
later, if we just keep them for
a few 1000 years, 100 million

689
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:58,060
years, sooner or later, large
wakes up inside physical

690
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:04,380
consciousness, and so it's
simply a consolidation of what's

691
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,160
taking place naturally and
normally. It's just a stage in

692
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:18,240
this process, the times that
I've been carried into deep time

693
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,600
and experience temporarily my
diamond soul, and then the

694
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:28,880
diamond stole the soul that's
emerging as an archetypal

695
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,280
imprint, an archetypal form. You

696
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,820
Yeah, it's hard to describe
because of the enormity and the

697
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:55,300
beauty and the joy we're looking
we're talking about a human

698
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,560
being that's completely healed
of all the wounds of history.

699
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,980
That's healed of all the
terrible things we've done to

700
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,760
each other, men and women and
wars and violence, healed all

701
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:13,080
those scars, healed a tremendous
breath of communion with the

702
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:20,060
natural world, an intimacy with
all life forms, not Only then, a

703
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:24,080
breath of companionship with all
life and with other human beings

704
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,380
and with human community and
with natural nature's community,

705
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:33,440
but an openness of the mind able
to take in more directly, enter

706
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,180
into deeper communion with the
intelligence of the universe. I

707
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,740
mean, the genius of the universe
has all the answers to all the

708
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:47,800
technological limit questions we
want to have answers to, and we

709
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,900
just are not able to download
all that knowledge. And the

710
00:54:52,900 --> 00:55:02,160
diamond soul is a more complete
and higher. Potency of human

711
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,980
being that can enter into deeper
downloads from the divine

712
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,540
intelligence. But it's not only
an expansion of heart and an

713
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:19,560
expansion of mind, our physical
senses are also amplified by

714
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:26,336
orders of magnitude in the very,
very last session. After 73

715
00:55:26,516 --> 00:55:30,176
sessions, the very last session,
the universe gave me an

716
00:55:30,176 --> 00:55:35,816
experience of what I call
diamond vision. Suddenly, in a

717
00:55:35,996 --> 00:55:40,900
kind of a late, late session,
wind down, clear space, my

718
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:45,460
vision became 1000s of times
more cute and sharper than it

719
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:50,860
had ever been before. I could
see things, details, gradients

720
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:54,220
of color, sharpness and
precision of form. I could just

721
00:55:54,220 --> 00:56:00,360
see. I was amazed that I ever
had accepted this fuzzy stuff as

722
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:06,120
real seeing. This was diamond
clarity seeing. And then after

723
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,320
10 minutes, it went away, and I
was seeing the way I normally

724
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,620
see. And that's when I
discovered, I realized what I

725
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,820
was being shown is that we tend
to think of sensation as kind of

726
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:22,040
a biomechanical process, but
it's actually a conscious

727
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,640
process, and the more
consciousness which is is

728
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:30,200
present in this body, this body
has built into it the capacity

729
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,640
for infinitely higher levels of
sensitive experience, Touch,

730
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,640
hearing, seeing, sensitivities
of all manner of physical

731
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:52,180
sensations. So it truly is. It's
heaven on earth in the body, so

732
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:57,520
that the body participates in
the qualities of heaven without

733
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,420
having to leave the physical
existence. That's why, I mean,

734
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,080
it's not an up and out
cosmology. It's bringing it in

735
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,260
deeper and deeper and deeper,
changing, literally, the

736
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:13,560
physiology of the body, to allow
it to operate in this ecstatic

737
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:22,280
state, which becomes the normal
state. Yeah, that's a child, I

738
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,880
think, is it's worth the labor
that we're going into to give

739
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,320
birth to and we are going in a
terribly, terribly severe labor.

740
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,320
Our past is being stripped away.
Will be stripped away. We will

741
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:41,200
lose all capacities that we
associate with normal and

742
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,680
minimal existence. This is what
happens in all mystical

743
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:49,720
traditions, in all psychedelic
traditions, literally, the small

744
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,700
has to be broken ground, to
dust, stripped and dismembered

745
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:00,600
in order for the new to awaken
within us. And this is happening

746
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,280
now, historically, where we're
entering into what I think of as

747
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:10,200
the dark night of our collective
soul. The Dark Night is an image

748
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:16,560
often used for a hard time, but
it's not a hard time in John of

749
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,240
the Cross, the dark night of
self is a hard time. The Dark

750
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,140
Night of the Soul is a very,
very intense purification time

751
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,340
which immediately precedes the
awakening of full illumination.

752
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,140
And the dark night of the of the
collective soul is a time of

753
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:40,360
intense purification, intense
loss of reality as we have known

754
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:46,600
it up to this point in time, and
I think out of the out of the

755
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,440
pain and suffering that's
coming, it's going to crack US

756
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:59,440
Open and break us down to our
center. And in this ordeal, we

757
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:06,780
will not survive, but we will
give birth to that in us which

758
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:12,240
is more beautiful, more
ecstatic, more competent, more

759
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:19,440
plugged in. I think we truly are
becoming a species of Bud,

760
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:24,020
species of Christ and prophets.
These are the models we've had

761
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,580
trying to give us some for
vision of what's happening in

762
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:33,680
the early years. We could not
imagine an ordinary human being

763
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,500
reaching that level of
excellence. But now we're

764
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,740
beginning to understand through
reincarnation, over and over and

765
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:44,620
over and over again, slowly, we
grow into that level of

766
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:50,140
excellence, which is simply a
level of transparency to the

767
00:59:50,140 --> 01:00:00,420
essential condition which in
which we experience life in. The

768
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:04,020
irony is, we experience what's
always been happening all the

769
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:08,400
way along. It's always been this
way. The universe has always

770
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,740
been one. The universe has
always been filled with

771
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,520
intelligence. We have always
been empty of self. But somehow

772
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,880
we distracted ourselves from
thinking that that's not there.

773
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,860
It's always been there. So we're
waking up to the paradise that

774
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,780
the universe already is. We just
been missing it,

775
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,560
Rachel Fleming: Chris, I just
find your experience and your

776
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:39,860
vision just such a hopeful one
as we move into what we see as

777
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:46,000
ecological crisis and societal
crisis, and I just again, as I

778
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,880
felt quite emotional, said at
the beginning it was just one of

779
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,420
the most inspiring books, or the
most inspiring book last year,

780
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:56,020
but what one of the most of my
lifetime? You know I and I'm

781
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,600
sure Colin would agree with me
on that. So it's so wonderful to

782
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,300
hear you speak. We have 10
minutes. I wondered if anybody

783
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:08,160
had any questions, I appreciate
it's quite a lot to take on

784
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,240
this. Please do raise your hand
if you have anything to ask

785
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,140
Chris. Also to say, we've
invited Chris back, Chris back

786
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:22,220
later in the year to be with us
a bit more, so there'll be more

787
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,380
opportunity to talk with him.
Does anybody have a question?

788
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,680
Otherwise, I'm going to pick on
Colin again, because I know

789
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,820
you've got to list Colin,

790
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,360
Unknown: Rachel, maybe I can
speak to the question I put in

791
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,880
the chat. That was really for
Stefan, but it was kind of a

792
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,740
tiny, tiny gesture towards some
sense of rightness and these

793
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,400
much, much bigger movements that
we can't even begin to fathom.

794
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,260
And then Chris used to spoke on
that, on paradigms that I've

795
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:02,220
never heard before, and part of
me feels so extremely joyful,

796
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,880
and like Rachel, I'm kind of
want to weep at the same time.

797
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:12,060
And as we are entering this dark
night of the soul, which I think

798
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:17,520
most of us kind of know, we can
feel it, and it's as I don't

799
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,400
know, you know, I feel like
small and I'm a mother of three

800
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,620
kids, and I, you know, and I'm
trying to understand how to be a

801
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:33,380
mother in this moment in time
and to love my children well.

802
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:36,800
And I'm not very sure how to do
that. So it's a very human

803
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:41,440
thing, but it's the sort of
smallest fractals of all the

804
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,480
other things, if I can make any
sense in that, and I just

805
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,100
wondered if you could speak to
that a little bit. No.

806
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,080
Chris Bache: Couple thoughts.
One of them is, first, I

807
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,320
absolutely identify with what
you're saying. I have three

808
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:05,640
children and Karen, parenting is
of the age, and the age we're

809
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,160
going into is going to be
different than parenting of the

810
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,360
age we're coming out of.
Because, you know, we're trying

811
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,980
to inculcate a different set of
values in our children as we

812
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:20,900
internalize these values
ourselves. And I think that's

813
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:25,940
how nature works. Each one of us
is a cell within a fractal cell

814
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:31,100
within a tissue of consciousness
and the tissue of the body. And

815
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:37,160
we are as we actualize the
future in our individual lives,

816
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,780
we catalyze an actualization of
the future in our collective

817
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:45,460
lives. And we do it not simply
by example. We do it because

818
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:50,020
every person who internalizes
and becomes the future that we

819
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:54,580
know we need to become, they
become a seed catalyst which

820
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:59,440
psychically activates the web of
transformation in people they

821
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,640
will never know, they will never
meet, necessarily, but it's

822
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,660
there. Just as we have been
nourished by the ancestors, we

823
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,820
have been nourished by other
people who are making

824
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,060
transformation. Our
transformation nourishes other

825
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,780
people. This came up in my
sessions multiple times that the

826
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:19,800
states of consciousness I was
entering into were being fed

827
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,900
into the collective psyche.
We're filtering into the

828
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:28,520
collective psyche. So when we do
ritual at dawn, when we do

829
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,960
rituals of embracing the sun as
as a representative of this

830
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,100
larger collective intelligence,
when we do rituals of

831
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:43,960
conservation and cultivate a
lifestyle of using less and

832
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:49,660
doing more. When we actualize
those things, we make it that

833
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:55,720
much easier for the entire
species to hold to actualize

834
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,320
those things, until eventually
we come to a tipping point right

835
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:04,020
and. At the tipping point, the
Uncommon Sense starts to become

836
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:10,560
common sense in this you know,
this transformation is not

837
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,440
something that's going to happen
to us, though. I think there is

838
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,080
a way in which nature knows what
it is doing. We are not

839
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,440
generating this transformation.
Nature is doing it. Nature is

840
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,720
taking us through it, but we are
cooperating with this process,

841
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,900
and it's not going to be handed
to us. We have to create it. We

842
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:33,740
have to create it out of the
fabric of our being, where we

843
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:39,080
are living. And here's a very
another consoling thought. When

844
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,860
you look at the reincarnation
literature, you look at the near

845
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:45,880
death episode literature, one
thing becomes very clear, we

846
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,740
choose the incarnations that we
find ourselves in. So at a time

847
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,980
when we knew more, we knew what
we were getting into. We knew

848
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,400
what this century was going to
be about. We knew that the dark

849
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,260
night of the soul was coming
upon us, we made a choice to

850
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:06,060
incarnate where we did and to
become the people that we are.

851
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:13,080
We and so therefore each one of
us carries a component of the

852
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,860
transformation that humanity is
trying to make. Each one of us

853
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,680
is the question is not, what?
What can we do? The question is,

854
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,760
do we have the courage to do
what is within our reach to do?

855
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,520
Because what is within our reach
has already been decided by the

856
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:37,280
soul. Okay, so parenting is a
big part of this transition.

857
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,380
Everything that we're doing,
art, medicine, knowledge,

858
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:47,380
communication technology is a
big part of this transition.

859
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,720
We're working it as we go.

860
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,320
Rachel Fleming: Thank you,
Chris, thank you. Thank

861
01:07:07,908 --> 01:07:12,648
right. Thank you so much for
sticking with us. I can see some

862
01:07:12,648 --> 01:07:19,368
hands up here just to say we
have rocketed over time. We were

863
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:23,240
going to edit it to be less than
an hour, but when we came to do

864
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:27,680
the editing, we found that we
couldn't, and I really wanted to

865
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,100
include that question at the
end, because it's very much

866
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:37,640
brings it down to what can we
do? So apologies for that. We'd

867
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:41,800
love you to stay a little bit
longer to to kind of share your

868
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,260
thoughts. I saw two hands up
there. One was Carol, another

869
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,920
one was Isabella. Carol, would
you like to go first if you

870
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,480
unmute yourself?

871
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:08,640
Gabby, Can you unmute Are we all
so the technology

872
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,720
Unknown: you can everyone can
unmute themselves. Fantastic.

873
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,600
Carol, lovely to see you. Thank
you.

874
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:26,960
Yeah, I'm sort of rendered
speechless, but, but I wanted to

875
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:32,240
ask what I thought I heard Chris
say was at the end there was

876
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:39,260
that our task is to tune in to
who we really are in this

877
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,640
lifetime and live that, and
that's the best we can do.

878
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,780
Because my first question was,
what? What ritual can I do? What

879
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:51,460
task you know would would
accelerate this process? But it

880
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,660
sounds like, from what he says,
that that's not what it's about.

881
01:08:55,660 --> 01:09:01,800
It's about living what we've
dreamt in for this lifetime.

882
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,300
Would you agree with that or
comment on that?

883
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,020
Rachel Fleming: That's certainly
what I heard. And actually, if

884
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,420
you read the book, I think
that's pretty much what he's

885
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:15,000
saying as well. Colin, would you
like to comment on that?

886
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,040
Colin Campbell: Yeah, I think
that is very much what he's

887
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:28,280
saying. I mean, you know, a lot
of what he says in the duration

888
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:33,920
of this talk, it's a it's a tiny
fragment of much, much bigger

889
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:39,800
body of work dating back into
Stan grofs work and so on. So to

890
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,240
really get a sense of what each
of the little statements he

891
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:48,040
makes, the importance of what
he's saying. It's kind of, it's

892
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,220
helpful to have, have, have,
have that within the context of

893
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:58,600
the much bigger picture. But I
think, you know, as I was, as I

894
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,140
was, we were coming to the end
of. This, I suddenly thought

895
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:05,340
back, and I thought I made a
mistake when I during the

896
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:10,320
introduction, I said, I spoke of
the subtitle of his book as

897
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,940
being the new ecology of mind,
steps towards the new ecology of

898
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:17,700
mind, when, in fact, it steps
towards the deep ecology of

899
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:22,280
mind. But, but I think that you
know that that's that, having

900
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,920
listened to the talk, you can
probably realize why I made that

901
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:30,380
mistake. Because we're, we're in
a moment now which is

902
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,920
unprecedented. I mean, any
moment of experience is

903
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,620
unprecedented. We are. We are as
individuals, as a collective, as

904
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:43,900
a globe, as a universe. This is
an unprecedented moment, and

905
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:48,700
yet, at the same time, we come
out of a long, long, long, long

906
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:55,420
history that this, this new
component of who we are is So on

907
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:59,860
one level where we're pulling
back into work we were

908
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:03,840
potentially and what we once did
much more effectively, I think,

909
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,900
is we, we go back into our our
historic roots, our experiential

910
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,720
historic roots, our psycho
spiritual historic roots, and we

911
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,840
draw into informing this present
moment. Those what we've

912
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,060
gathered in that time, but then
in that moment, also we we

913
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:28,340
potentially translate it into a
response to the newness of where

914
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:32,600
we are now. And I really think
that's the task of our time. And

915
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,860
the part that we're not doing
very well at the moment is this

916
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:44,500
reaching back into the vast form
of who we, who we are is, is,

917
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,460
kind of is expressed also in our
long, long, long, long, long

918
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:53,680
history, our trajectory of where
we've come from to get here. So

919
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:58,360
so I think that you know, the
totality of who we are is is, as

920
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,620
Chris points out, it's kind of
always there. It's always

921
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,360
naturally going on. But we we
compress ourselves into a

922
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:12,300
fragment of that, and a lifetime
is in a certain sense that, but

923
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,860
equally and as importantly, I
think, this particular time that

924
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:20,780
we're in now, you know what I
tend to refer to as an

925
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:26,540
industrial, cultural, globalized
time is even more so, you know,

926
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,960
because I think we've we've
condensed ourselves and

927
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:33,680
retracted ourselves, retracted
the notion of who we are into an

928
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:39,140
even tinier fragment than we
might have done previously. And

929
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:44,380
so I do think what we're tasked
with right now very, very

930
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:51,280
fundamentally, is remembering,
on the one hand, which is going

931
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,800
back and finding ways of RE,
entering into what is inherently

932
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,500
in us, which is our past, which
is dynamically still present in

933
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:08,520
us and active in us, and at the
same time, springing out of that

934
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,620
into a dreaming of who we are
now and what is asked of us in

935
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:17,160
this in this moment. What is,
what does it mean now to be in

936
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:22,100
this newness and this, as Chris
so beautifully puts it, this

937
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:31,400
tectonic, profoundly, all
encompassing seeming change of

938
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,300
what it means to be human, and
presumably what it means to be a

939
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:39,980
universe at some level. So I
think what you're asking is an

940
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:43,660
incredibly important question,
and I think it's a huge one, and

941
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,360
probably one which needs a
considerable amount of

942
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,000
pondering, but I'll say that for
the time period.

943
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:59,200
Unknown: Yeah, my experience in
this lifetime is many, many

944
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:04,524
different ways of being, and

945
01:14:07,104 --> 01:14:09,984
I'm aware of the sort of small
self that just gets on with the

946
01:14:09,984 --> 01:14:14,304
everyday life and doesn't and
isn't really doing much, but

947
01:14:14,304 --> 01:14:18,264
then there's part of me that is
doing Much more interesting

948
01:14:18,264 --> 01:14:28,400
stuff, or much more spiritual
stuff. My question with that is,

949
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:34,100
can I relax and let that happen?
Will it happen or should I be

950
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:39,320
focusing? Should I be there's
always this worry, isn't there

951
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:42,400
that the world's gonna win? We
haven't done enough, and all

952
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:47,620
that kind of anxiety that comes
from the industrial setup here.

953
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,460
But no answer. Probably

954
01:14:54,760 --> 01:15:00,300
one to brew on, yeah. Women's
always brewing. Yeah. Before,

955
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:10,080
Isabella, you had a question,
you're gonna have to unmute I'm

956
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:10,800
afraid.

957
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,680
Yes, brilliant. Thank you. Um,
it's my name is actually

958
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:24,260
Christina, but I'm on my laptop.
Sorry. So that's why the Zoom is

959
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:30,860
named Isabella. It's maybe more
of an observation, or I don't

960
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:35,780
know exactly, but I have to
admit that I haven't read that

961
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:44,200
book yet, but I had many of my
own experiences of LSD and

962
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:50,800
Ayahuasca when I was young, and
it has certainly informed my

963
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,240
life. And I would, you know,
completely agree with so, so, so

964
01:15:55,300 --> 01:16:01,440
many things that he said up to
now, and I have been thinking

965
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,980
about this a long time, but
never very scientifically, but

966
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:10,860
just try to live by what I had
experienced and learned. But one

967
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:14,280
thing always puzzled me,
because, like he said at the

968
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:21,800
very beginning, it is the taking
of the of the drugs is a

969
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:29,060
shortcut to an opening into a
world, in a way. I always felt

970
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:37,040
that, and I always felt that it
has kind of helped me to have a

971
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,480
bigger understanding of the
universe and of many, many

972
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:44,500
things that he has been talking
about, and in particular, to all

973
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:50,260
these connections, and to the
connections, also to my ancestry

974
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:57,520
and to the wisdom of my
ancestors and and I always felt

975
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,920
an obligation, in some Ways, for
some strange reason, to try and

976
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,960
share this with others. And in
my case, I did try to do that

977
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:13,380
mostly through art. But then my
observation was that we are all

978
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:19,860
on so many in different stages
in our lives and in our I

979
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:24,320
suppose I don't know in that so
called Journey, or, you know,

980
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:31,400
whatever, that it's very, very
difficult to often try and

981
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:37,280
explain all these things that we
can actually see and all these

982
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:45,940
connections to people who may
not have had the privilege of

983
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:52,660
being opening the mind. And so
I've often wondered, if we say

984
01:17:52,720 --> 01:18:00,040
we about the collective well,
does that actually really exist?

985
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:05,040
You know, is that, does that
time that we are apparently

986
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:13,560
entering exist as a collective,
or is it just some who are at

987
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:23,360
the certain stage in their
rebirth or reincarnation, or

988
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:28,280
whatever it is. And you know,
does that actually, is there

989
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:33,680
even a sort of a time of that,
or is that some, somehow an

990
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:39,740
illusion we have created for
ourselves to try and understand

991
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:43,360
things? I don't know. I'm not
sure if I make myself clear.

992
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:47,620
It's really difficult to talk
about these things.

993
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:57,160
Rachel Fleming: I'm thinking of
what he was saying about if, if

994
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:01,920
the individual does it, then it
kind of adds to the collective,

995
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,540
and I'm just thinking of Rupert,
sheldrakes, Morphic resonance,

996
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,520
Colin will be able to kind of
talk more about that. But I just

997
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:15,780
wonder if it's that kind of
process at work that once the

998
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:19,620
individuals start, then it just
becomes easier for the

999
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:23,180
collective. Is that what you're
saying? Christina, I may have

1000
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:23,660
understood,

1001
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,960
Unknown: yes. I mean, I'm not
sure what I'm saying. It's more

1002
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,900
that I'm asking. I've often, you
know, there is, there is maybe

1003
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:33,860
this, this worry or this doubt,
because I have become very, very

1004
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:38,300
aware, and hopefully tried, at
least very hard to live my life

1005
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:44,740
in a way that being very aware
of every thing you say, and

1006
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:49,600
everything every gesture one
does, and, you know, every

1007
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,760
pebble you drop into the pond
has a has a, you know, yeah, it

1008
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,000
does make some sort of a little
wave, perhaps, and it touches

1009
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,820
things, and it changes things.
It changes the universe, if you

1010
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:07,680
wish. So there is that
awareness, but I'm not sure that

1011
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:12,780
that awareness is really the
same for everybody. And yes, it

1012
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:17,160
does make a big difference, but
at the same time, we are

1013
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:22,280
worrying about an age we are
entering, and I do, don't get me

1014
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,340
wrong, and I like, you know, to
think about this, but at the

1015
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,780
same time, I'm sort of thinking,
hang on a minute, in a way that

1016
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:33,920
doesn't really make sense in the
big scheme of the universe,

1017
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:40,780
because it has all it's already
there. It has already been it's

1018
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:45,880
already, you know, whatever
comes, it's not a particularly

1019
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,960
new entrance into something,
because some people are at this

1020
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:55,000
stage, and others have this or
some, you know, we have already

1021
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,640
had it's, It's not the same
exactly, but it's, it's not

1022
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:07,860
necessarily very specific, just
to our very lifetime here and

1023
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:13,980
now, because the same pains, the
same choice, the same thing, has

1024
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:20,780
been experienced a million,
million times four in A way, and

1025
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:26,720
it is, in the end, about the
individual, which also has been

1026
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,820
historically named so many
times, like interestingly, what

1027
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:37,220
Carl says it is, it is like the
Greek poets have been very clear

1028
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:43,960
about saying and become who you
are, in a way, and that's that's

1029
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,580
development, isn't it, that to
have that understanding of the

1030
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:54,760
universe and of the vastness and
of the lack of of boundaries, in

1031
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,940
a way, and that everything is
interconnected, absolutely

1032
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:01,860
everything. So I don't know
anyway.

1033
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,400
Rachel Fleming: Thank you so
much, Chris, and I'm sure that

1034
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,240
we could, like really explore
that we have about six minutes

1035
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:13,560
left. Theresa has got a question
before I come to you, Teresa, I

1036
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:18,600
just wanted to say as well, just
in case people have to go. So

1037
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,100
Chris is going to come back as
part of our contemporary animism

1038
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:25,700
program, which starts again
July. We have a new intake every

1039
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,300
year, so we still have some
places on that. Somebody was

1040
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:32,600
saying that they'd love to,
Jackie, you were saying that

1041
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:37,400
you'd love to explore this kind
of subject more. That's what

1042
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,740
we're hoping to do in this
year's program, breathing

1043
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:44,680
workshops, absolutely again.
Jackie, you're saying that it'd

1044
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,560
be wonderful to have a breathing
workshop. I'm hoping that we're

1045
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,440
going to do that as part of this
program as well. But yes,

1046
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:54,940
absolutely. Breathwork certainly
for me, it's where it's at.

1047
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,800
Yeah. So Therese, I wanted to
come to you, and if anybody has

1048
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:02,880
one, put up your digital hand,
and we'll try and get them in.

1049
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,100
Unknown: But there's lovely to
see.

1050
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:10,980
It's just a comment. I don't
know. I haven't read his books.

1051
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:14,520
I haven't actually heard of him
before, but it's just an

1052
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:20,300
observation of something that he
he said that even though he kind

1053
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:25,400
of rejects the transcendent
thought of or the thought of

1054
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:33,080
transcending earthly, bodily
reality like you find in much

1055
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:39,380
Eastern thought, he still
presents an idea that, by That

1056
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:43,900
fits very neatly with our
Western thought of evolution and

1057
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:48,940
development, and I'm not sure
quite what I think about that.

1058
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:53,800
It's like he takes something old
evolutionary thoughts and

1059
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:59,800
rejects it, and he presents
replaces it with another one.

1060
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:07,560
And I don't know, I guess I'd
like to see more of using his

1061
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:15,060
experience as a way to accept
that time isn't linear, and

1062
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:24,500
things exist at the same time in
different layers, here and now,

1063
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,040
and not necessarily for a means,
but just that, this is how it

1064
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,940
is. I'm not sure if I'm making
much sense, but

1065
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:38,000
Rachel Fleming: yeah. Do you
have a response on that? Colin?

1066
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,600
Colin Campbell: Well, I think
you opening a, it's a kind of

1067
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,780
door handle thing where we
could, we could spend the rest

1068
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,920
of the night on this topic.

1069
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,120
Rachel Fleming: Yeah,

1070
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,000
Unknown: sorry, it's

1071
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Colin Campbell: very important,
and I think you're raising some

1072
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,320
very interesting question, and
kind of harkens back into my my

1073
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:05,460
question, or. On time and how we
perceive things, you know, and

1074
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:11,340
when we we have this notion, I
think that as Western, well as

1075
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:15,300
humanity, that we have a certain
way of perceiving time and that

1076
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:18,480
that's what being that's part of
being human. I don't agree with

1077
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,280
that. I think that the way we
perceive time, and the way we

1078
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:26,060
perceive the nature of
sequential events is very

1079
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:29,900
characteristic of a particular
moment in our history as human

1080
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:33,740
beings, and is definitely not
necessarily the case in our

1081
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,220
earlier states, and perhaps
won't be in our future states

1082
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:44,680
either. So so in a way. But what
we what we are, what we have to

1083
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,560
struggle with is the fact that
we are indeed immersed within

1084
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,760
this framework that we call
present existence, you know, in

1085
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,420
the particular cultural, socio
cultural, kind of framework that

1086
01:25:55,420 --> 01:26:00,160
we're in. And, you know, and so
when we have these

1087
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:06,120
conversations, you know, we're,
we're tasked with modulating to

1088
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:09,180
other views and other
perspectives that we might have

1089
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:12,720
within us and within our history
and so on. You know, circular

1090
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:16,740
dynamics, as opposed to linear
dynamics and so on. But at the

1091
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:20,300
same time, I think we, we're,
we're also tasked with coming

1092
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:25,040
back to risk with rest within
where we are in order to not get

1093
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,740
completely lost in the
transitive process that we're

1094
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:33,800
trying to do. So, you know, I
think that, I mean, I don't

1095
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,340
really, I wouldn't know how to
answer the question exactly,

1096
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:40,360
but, you know, I think that we

1097
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:48,880
I'm opening a can that could
last forever. Now, let me stop

1098
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,760
there, but I think it's a really
good question, and I think it's

1099
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,660
an interesting thing to ponder
further. Yeah, thank you.

1100
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:58,540
Rachel Fleming: Which we're
gonna have to do because it's

1101
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,920
time or it's time a long time
ago. Actually, I do apologize

1102
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,420
for keeping you longer than you
were expecting. Lovely to see

1103
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:10,320
you. Look we have a small little
group that made it to the end.

1104
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,320
Unknown: Yes.

1105
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:17,580
Rachel Fleming: Dunno what more
to say, really. That was Chris

1106
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:22,280
Bache. Check out his books. Have
a look at our contemporary

1107
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,580
animism program. If you want to
do more of that kind of

1108
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,120
conversation, we also do a lot
of embodied stuff as well. It's

1109
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:35,120
not just all talking. So lovely
to see you tonight, everybody,

1110
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:35,720
and

1111
01:27:36,259 --> 01:27:41,019
see you very soon. Bye for now.
Thank you Gabby, thank you

1112
01:27:41,019 --> 01:27:41,439
Colin,

1113
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:43,720
Unknown: thank you very much.

1114
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:50,800
Thank you. Bye. You. Thank You.

1
00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:02,824
Chris Bache: Eventually, I came
to understand that the many

2
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:07,684
deaths that one endures in this
process are actually that death

3
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:10,984
is actually a symptom of
purification. The form that you

4
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:15,604
are can die. The structures of
your life can be shattered, but

5
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:19,864
the inner essence of your being
cannot die. And I began to

6
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:24,080
realize that death, what we
experience as death, is actually

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,100
a deep form of purification,
which is letting go of the small

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,400
in order to welcome and be
welcomed by that which is

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,940
larger.

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,020
Tami Simon: Hello, friends.
Welcome. I'm so happy that

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,740
you're here with us for insights
at the edge. Live in this

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,920
episode of insights at the edge.
My guest is Christopher M Bache,

13
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,440
PhD. Let me tell you a little
bit about Chris. He's professor

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,420
emeritus in the Department of
Philosophy and Religious Studies

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,640
at Youngstown State University,
where he taught for 33 years.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,500
He's also adjunct faculty at the
California Institute of integral

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,480
studies, Emeritus fellow at the
Institute of Noetic Sciences,

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,020
and he's on the Advisory Council
of Grof legacy training. He's

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,940
written several books, including
dark night, early dawn, the

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,380
living classroom, and a book
that got my attention. Some

21
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,960
friends of mine said, I'm
reading this book. It's called

22
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,420
LSD and the mind of the
universe. You've got to read it.

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,240
It's so engrossing. It's a page
turner. It will actually

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,540
introduce you what the mind of
the universe? What's that? And

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,440
you know, if there was ever a
moment where I think it's

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,660
appropriate to say this
conversation is a conversation

27
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,120
that truly will be filled with
insights at the edge, it's this

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,660
conversation with Chris Bache.
Chris welcome.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,600
Chris Bache: Hi, Tammy. It's a
pleasure to be here with you

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,320
this evening.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,840
Tami Simon: Tell us a little bit
right here at the beginning,

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,500
what prompted you to engage
ready for this over 20 years in

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:35,060
73 high dose LSD sessions that
were structured in a specific

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,660
way for the purpose of deep
spiritual awakening and

35
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,820
exploring the nature of the
cosmos. What inspired you to

36
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,280
engage in such what we'll learn
was really an arduous

37
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,360
undertaking.

38
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,560
Chris Bache: Well, I had just
finished graduate school. I got

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,460
my PhD from Brown University in
philosophy of religion. I had

40
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,540
published my dissertation in a
series of articles, and was

41
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,740
looking for where to take my
work next. And at that point in

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,760
my life, I met the work of Ian
Stevenson in reincarnation

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,020
research at Virginia, and, more
importantly, of Stan Grof. And

44
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,960
as soon as I read realms of the
human unconscious, which had

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,500
just been published, this was in
78 when I started, I immediately

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,580
saw the profound implications
for Stan's work for philosophy

47
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,360
of religion, not just for
psychology, and I knew I wanted

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,080
to get involved in doing this
work. So even though LSD had

49
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,240
been made illegal, by that time
this is had been made illegal,

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:50,860
1970 I chose to conscientiously
break the law and to begin a

51
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:57,880
series of rigorously structured
following stands protocol of LSD

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,680
sessions, and I chose, after
three medium dose sessions to

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,220
work at high doses. This is a
protocol I don't recommend

54
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,400
today. I would be much gentler
on myself if I were doing it

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,440
over again, but at the time I
did, this is what I was doing to

56
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,980
explore to accelerate my own
spiritual development. And then

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,240
quickly it evolved into engaging
the deep structures of human

58
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,900
evolution and trying to support
humanity's spiritual

59
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,380
development, and then exploring
this marvelous universe that we

60
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,220
are part of.

61
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,660
Tami Simon: You write towards
the beginning of the book. In

62
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,240
the end, what's important is not
the method of exploration used,

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,580
but what this method shows us
about the extraordinary universe

64
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,300
we live in, and that's what I
want to focus on in our

65
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,760
conversation, is really the
discoveries that you made. And

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,840
why don't we start off with. The
title of the book, LSD, and here

67
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,840
we go. The mind of the universe.
I'm not sure everyone even can

68
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,320
track with you there, the
universe has a mind. Tell us

69
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,940
what you discovered about this.

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,960
Chris Bache: Well, as I came to
experience it, I experience

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,540
consciousness as like an
infinite ocean, and when we open

72
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,620
ourselves in deep psychedelic
states, it's like our mind is a

73
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,520
seed catalyst that we drop into
this ocean, and it crystallizes

74
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,260
a set of experiences out of this
infinite potential. And by

75
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,880
absorbing these experiences and
internalizing them and learning

76
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,900
what we are being offered. We're
being being taught. We're

77
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,620
changed, we're purified, we're
we're we're changed inwardly.

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,580
And then when we drop that
changed mind into this infinite

79
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,900
potential, it triggers an even
deeper set of experiences out of

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,960
out of its infinity. And I
always experienced myself as

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,860
engaging an intelligence, a
consciousness, that was

82
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,000
directing my sessions. I mean, I
never did not control what was

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,300
unfolding in my sessions. I was
always yielding and following a

84
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,720
lead that came from conscious,
deeper levels of consciousness,

85
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,560
and as the journey continued,
the levels of consciousness that

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,480
I was entering deepen several
times, multiple times. And so

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,420
what do we call this infinite
consciousness? It's been called

88
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,640
many things in the world's
mystical traditions. I hesitate

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,720
to call it God, though. I do
refer to it as the divine,

90
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,160
because God has so many layers
of historical, historical

91
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,040
overlay, which I wouldn't want
to affirm. So just to give him

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,300
some sense of the approximation
of the vast scale and scope of

93
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,200
this consciousness, I call it
the mind of the universe. Just

94
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,800
as the universe has a body. It
has a mind. And you can our mind

95
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,320
is as our body is a product of
our universe. Our mind is also a

96
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,740
product of the universe. And
when we sink deeply into our

97
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,320
consciousness, we come out into
a vast consciousness, which you

98
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,400
can think of as the divine
consciousness, or you can think

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,200
of it as the mind of the
universe.

100
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,940
Tami Simon: Now you use this
word purification, and I

101
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:35,780
referred to the 73 journeys that
you went on as having a quality

102
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,960
of arduousness to at least it
read that way to me, as you

103
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,120
include much of the descriptions
of what you went through in each

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,600
one of these journeys. I mean,
in the beginning, you know what

105
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:56,140
you're writing about is
seizures, vomiting, convulsions,

106
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,140
it sounded really rough. Why was
that? Do you think now, in

107
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,820
retrospect, as you look back,
why was all of that physical and

108
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,880
energetic purification
necessary?

109
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,420
Chris Bache: Well, there are
many levels of answers to that,

110
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:22,280
but basically, if we want to
move into deeper intimacy with

111
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,580
the consciousness of the
universe. We're moving into

112
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,080
states of consciousness which
are large, which are vast, and

113
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,680
operate at a much higher level
of much higher frequency, much

114
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,160
higher energy level, and our
egoic consciousness, the

115
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,300
consciousness which is surrounds
our body in a sense, and which

116
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,560
is the consciousness that we are
operationalizing as egoic

117
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,760
consciousness is just too small.
We have to let go of that

118
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,020
consciousness. And some people
find that easier and more

119
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,180
difficult, but letting go of
that consciousness and dying as

120
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,980
an at the egoic level and
entering into spiritual reality,

121
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,400
I found is actually the first of
many cycles of death and

122
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,900
rebirth, because the universe
has many levels and many

123
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:16,200
dimensions to it. In order to
enter each successive deeper

124
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,460
level, we have to go through a
deeper level of surrender, and

125
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,700
that often involves very intense
purification, confrontations.

126
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,740
And every step deeper into the
universe is a step into a higher

127
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,520
bandwidth of energy, if you
will. We have to literally learn

128
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,600
to become a being who can live,
can live at that level, become

129
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,840
operational that level for hours
and hours at a time. And that

130
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,200
takes that takes work. It takes
a lot of work.

131
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,220
Tami Simon: You write in the
context of a psychedelic

132
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,080
session, pain is something we
learn to embrace. One learns to

133
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,720
reverse one's instinct to avoid
suffering and to. Open to it

134
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,500
instead, not because we like to
suffer, but because of what lies

135
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,000
on the other side of suffering.
Yes, and I wanted to understand

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,120
more about what you learned
about embracing pain, and I

137
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,860
asked this question, Chris,
because in the midst of our

138
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,440
lives, there's so much pain we
need to embrace and so much

139
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,260
letting go that we have to do,
and I don't think that many of

140
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,540
us are that good at it.

141
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,220
Chris Bache: Well, I want to be
careful. I don't want to over

142
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,020
generalize that the insights or
truths that emerge in a

143
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,640
psychedelic session and apply
them to circumstances in our

144
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,240
everyday life. So we'd have to
make some necessary adjustments

145
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,380
to it. But in a psychedelic
session, when we hyper amplify

146
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,620
consciousness, consciousness
begins to clean itself. It

147
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,200
begins to transform itself, and
as it purifies itself, and as it

148
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,580
goes through these first we
encounter unfinished business,

149
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,640
you know, things we'd rather not
face, things we're scared of,

150
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,940
things that frighten us. But
that's only early layers.

151
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,480
Eventually we're going through
layers in which we're sloughing

152
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,480
off not only our personal
identity, but we're sloughing

153
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,820
off our identity as a human
being per se, and then our

154
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,620
identity as a time space being
as we're moving beyond a linear

155
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,320
time and beyond three
dimensional space. All of these

156
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,980
adjustments to move into these
deeper states of consciousness

157
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,760
involve again when you're
working with high doses of a

158
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,040
psychedelic like LSD, it
intensifies and accelerates this

159
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,300
purification process. If you
took an ice cube and put it next

160
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,100
to a candle, meaning analogy for
a gentler spiritual practice,

161
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,540
the candle would melt the ice
cube very gently, and it would

162
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,500
weep and it would dissolve. But
if you threw the same ice cube

163
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,460
on a hot skillet, it would bump
around, jump around and snap,

164
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,600
crackle and pop as the molecules
exploded. And psychedelic

165
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,860
sessions are kind of like the
latter. You're doing the same

166
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,600
process that you do in deep,
long, contemplative retreat

167
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,260
context, but you're doing it
faster, and because you're doing

168
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,620
it faster, there's more of a
kind of a convulsive quality to

169
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,760
it. There's more intense quality
to it. But essentially, it is

170
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,440
the same as traditional
spiritual practitioners undergo

171
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,040
in the dark night of the soul,
in these processes. It's the

172
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,140
same process, eventually, I came
to understand that the many

173
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,060
deaths that one endures in this
process are actually that death

174
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,260
is actually a symptom of
purification. Once you've died

175
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,240
several times and been reborn on
the other side of that process,

176
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,180
you realize you can't die. It's
impossible to die. The form that

177
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,140
you are can die. The structures
of your life can be shattered,

178
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,900
but the inner essence of your
being cannot die. So that death

179
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,340
itself begins to lose its
categories. It becomes to be a

180
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,680
non functional category. And I
began to realize that death,

181
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,340
what we experience as death, is
actually a deep form of

182
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,780
purification, which is letting
go of the small in order to

183
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,480
welcome and be welcomed by that
which is larger.

184
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,500
Tami Simon: Which brings me to
wanting to make sure that we

185
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,260
carefully parse out but I still
want to address here in the

186
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,700
midst of our lives, not in the
midst of psychedelic sessions.

187
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,780
What did you learn about what it
takes to die before we die?

188
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,020
That's really what I want to
understand. Yeah,

189
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,360
Chris Bache: I want to be
careful, because I don't want to

190
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,860
frame my work in terms of the
dynamics of spiritual awakening.

191
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,120
And that phrasing, to die before
we die, so that we do not die

192
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,200
when we die, is kind of really
oriented around the dynamics of

193
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,240
spiritual awakening in my sense,
in my work, even though I began

194
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,920
this work with a sort of an
awakening, a spiritual awakening

195
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,320
agenda. It became much more than
that. It became an adventure of

196
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,700
exploring the deep structure of
the universe itself. And so

197
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,100
death changes as one goes, as
one pivots from spiritual

198
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,240
awakening as a project to
cosmological exploration as a

199
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,000
project. But what I learned, if
I were to try to summarize it in

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,520
some way, first, I have no fear
of death whatsoever. I have no

201
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,080
fear of dying. I feel like I've
died many times in that process

202
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,740
and in that process of dying.
Before you die physically.

203
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,040
There. Is a great relaxation
that settles in an abiding

204
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,900
communion with the universe or
with the divine, which begins to

205
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:16,560
saturate one's physical
existence, so that the boundary

206
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,740
line between here and there,
between being physically alive

207
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,740
and spiritually alive and
cosmologically alive, it gets

208
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,620
very thin in the process. So I
guess I've learned to trust life

209
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,740
more, to recognize that anything
that's coming at me, which is

210
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,060
challenging and difficult, is to
be embraced head on,

211
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,920
straightforward, to not back
away from anything to see

212
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,400
everything to its root, and
that's a major lesson in

213
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,060
psychedelic work. If you run
from the hard stuff, it only

214
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,420
gets worse. But if you embrace
the challenges and let the

215
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,200
universe take you where it wants
to take you, then eventually you

216
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,480
will come to a breaking point,
and when you go through that eye

217
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,720
of that needle, you will open up
into a magnificent landscape a

218
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
different level of being you.

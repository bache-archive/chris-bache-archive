your cell phone. Please. Cell

12
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,620
phones interfere with our sound
system, and we're already having

13
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,320
to deal with two poles that
interfere with the sound system.

14
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,020
So let's make it a little kinder
and turn off our cell phone.

15
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,420
Okay, let's all take a deep
breath, and if it feels

16
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,420
comfortable for you, close your
eyes and let's allow ourselves

17
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,780
to be fully present in this
place that has been dedicated

18
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:43,840
for A very long time to opening
hearts, awakening minds. It's

19
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,340
been dedicated for a long, long
time to take us into the core of

20
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,800
our being, where we know our
magnificence. We know that we

21
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,080
are the light of the world,
where we can access our joy, our

22
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,380
peace, our wisdom, our
creativity, and our faith and

23
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,660
our strength and our commitment
to keep growing, keep deepening,

24
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,700
keep awakening. So we give
thanks for this place, all those

25
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,260
who came before us, those who
had the vision to establish such

26
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,680
a movement called Unity. So
today, we once again open our

27
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,700
hearts and minds to feel our
unity, our oneness with all of

28
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:35,180
life, all of humankind, with the
one presence known by many

29
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:42,100
names. The service is turned
over to spirit. And so it is,

30
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:49,480
and so we let it be okay. Here
we are. We're now going to do

31
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,960
together the Lord's Prayer,
translated from the Aramaic

32
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,900
language of Jesus, all together,
Please, father, mother, birther

33
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,900
and the breath of all create a
space inside of us and fill it

34
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,720
with your presence. Let oneness
now prevail. Your one desire

35
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,360
then flows through ours as
energy fills all forms, Give us

36
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,920
this day our physical and
spiritual nourishment and

37
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,380
untangle the knots of error
behind us. As we release others,

38
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,920
do not let appearances make us
forgetful of the source, but

39
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,800
free us to act appropriately.
From age to age through you flow

40
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,220
the glorious harmonies of life.
May these words be verbal

41
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:50,680
statements through which our
future grows. Let's take a deep

42
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,760
breath every Sunday when we
gather together like this and we

43
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,100
say these words, I hope you can
feel the power, the incredible

44
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,880
presence of spirit that happens
within us and around us when we

45
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:14,520
say this in a conscious way, not
wrote, not like just ho hum, but

46
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,580
really connecting with the
words. It's a powerful thing.

47
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay, for all of you who I don't

be making her way back home. So
we're glad about that. And she

for? What about your new hobby?

108
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,940
What about being able to go to
school? Is there something

109
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,020
that's in the world you can't go

Speaker 3: and I do things like
life and for God,

114
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,919
Margaret Hiller: so one of The
things that we are here very,

115
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:49,839
very grateful for is that you,
you guys, come here to remind us

116
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,299
that we are the light of the
world, to remind us that you

117
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:59,439
have a lot to teach us and
remind us of we're really glad

118
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,039
that you're here. That's one of
the biggest things I'm grateful

119
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,839
for today, that all of you are
here because each one of us have

120
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,999
a part in telling the wonderful
story of our human family,

121
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:17,639
waking up and realizing that we
really can be love and kindness

122
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:20,899
in the world. We can make a
world that works for everybody.

123
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:24,559
That's what we learn about when
we come here, and you're a part

124
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,819
of that. So let's all stand
we're going to give thanks for

125
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:35,119
you. I'm doing our blessing, and
it is going to be up on the

126
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:43,359
screen, and I'm going to ask you
to turn towards all these people

127
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,639
out here and put through with
your hands. Remember love and

128
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:53,559
blessing comes through our
hands, our words, our eyes, our

129
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:56,799
presence. So you're going to
bless all of them out there, and

130
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,619
they're going to bless you right
back. Okay. We love

131
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,140

appreciate you, we behold Christ

132
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,260

we're starting a new one.

160
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,720
Margaret Hiller: Okay, so the
new book will be Daring Greatly

161
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:27,560
by Rene Brown, and so that will
be happening probably a couple

162
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,420
of Wednesdays from now. Okay,
all right, so let's take a deep

163
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,120
breath, and once again, we are
reading this morning out of how

164
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,260
to speak unity. If you didn't
know how to speak unity, you can

165
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,060
buy a book of different terms
about unity, and one of the

166
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:52,000
words that this author, Temple
Hies defines is the word being.

167
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:58,240
And so this is what Unity
teaches. Are we human beings or

168
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,420
human doings? In our culture, we
have created a belief that

169
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,700
levels of busyness equal levels
of importance. We need a 12 step

170
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,520
group for that to achieve this
sense of importance, we often

171
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,360
push ourselves past our natural
limits. We were created as human

172
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,860
beings rather than human doing
let's all say that together, we

173
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,300
were created as human beings
rather than human

174
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,140
Unknown: doings. It is

175
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,320
Margaret Hiller: imperative that
we remember to take time to

176
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:41,740
simply be incorporating regular
routines such as meditation or

177
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,320
walks in nature rejuvenate our
spirits and lower our stress.

178
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,620
That's a good thing. What some
of us were doing last Saturday

179
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,060
at the main Earth spiritual
center. We were walking in

180
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,200
nature. Nature is free to us and
allows us to connect with our

181
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,480
inner stillness. Or the book of
Psalms we read my Remember, be

182
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:11,520
still and know I am so part of
what we try to do here. In what

183
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,920
we hope to do is to create a
space of stillness and peace,

184
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,440
even within the atmosphere of
singing and teaching and

185
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,740
listening and learning and
encouraging one another. It's

186
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,760
all about healing, and we give
thanks for that. Okay, now we're

187
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,180
going to read our unity
statement of purpose. Please,

188
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,980
all of us together. I am the
consciousness of unity. Christ

189
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,900
Church, a unified board and
congregation, nurturing

190
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,140
spiritual growth, inspiring
creativity, sharing time,

191
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:53,260
talents, treasures and expanding
awareness of divine awesome and

192
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,580
Lily, we invite you back to Do a
song for us. Thank you Very

193
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,240
much. You

194
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,280
Unknown: Good morning,
everybody, good

195
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,940
Speaker 3: I just need to tell
you briefly about this song. So

196
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,540
the song that I'm getting ready
to sing to you was a dream.

197
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,940
I was sleep, and Beyonce was
singing this song in my dream.

198
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:46,540
Wow. And I always have to give
people space to laugh. There was

199
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,680
a man, and he had moved, was
very distraught. Apparently,

200
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,340
something tragic had happened in
his life, and he had moved into

201
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,080
mental illness, and he began to
walk around the middle of a

202
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,420
water tower, and Beyonce lived
on the second floor, and she

203
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,260
could see the man in the water
tower, and she looked out of her

204
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,820
window and started singing this
song to him. Then she invited

205
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,540
the man into his house, to her
house, and started stroking his

206
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,920
hair and singing these words
into his eyes. And I woke up,

207
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,740
and I just kept singing the
song. And so there will be a

208
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,800
point in the time while I'm
singing that I will ask you to

209
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,140
look into somebody's eyes and
say these words you

210
00:24:47,740 --> 00:25:01,260
in your night and when your eyes
start feeling. Take a breath.

211
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,420
Unknown: In God. Comfort you.

212
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,000
It dreams

213
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,460
have died and no one knows how
you feel

214
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,120
inside, where you can hide, You.

215
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,100
Oh, find Somebody to sing.

216
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:17,580
The party, your dreams have died
and no one knows how You feel

217
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:24,260
inside. Come to you can hide for

218
00:27:42,860 --> 00:28:00,060

00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,520

239
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,840

240
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,559
Margaret Hiller: anybody back
row, bench? Anybody? Okay, going

241
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:24,979
once, going twice, and here we
are, welcome. Everybody. Okay,

242
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:29,779
we are going to now read the
Daily word. This is one of our

243
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:36,319
oldest publications, and we have
a beautiful affirmation up here

244
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,239
this morning. And the word is
comfort, right? You know, from

245
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,999
the in the South, in
Jacksonville, you say comfort.

246
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,239
And then my voice teacher
drilled it into my brain,

247
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:53,559
comfort. And I see that you sing
that word just like that. You

248
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,359
sing your comfort song. God is
my comfort and my refuge. Let's

249
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:02,099
say that together, God is my
comfort and my comfort and my

250
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:06,779
refuge, beautiful and the daily
word goes on to say, this life

251
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:13,439
is full of joy and sorrow, but
no condition is beyond the

252
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:18,779
comfort of spirit, whatever my
experience, even before I voice

253
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:24,079
My prayer, the comfort I seek is
available to me. I have what I

254
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:32,479
need for any situation I ask and
I receive. No request is too

255
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:37,339
great or too small. Each one
invites answers, abundance and

256
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:42,399
comfort to arise within me. All
that I need is available for me

257
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:47,979
to claim in this very moment.
Spirit in me is my comforter,

258
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:53,259
inspiration and guidance to
manifest what I need. Gratitude

259
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:57,819
fills my heart as I know my
needs are met. I am sheltered in

260
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:03,899
the loving embrace of the Divine
Presence. Peace fills me heart

261
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:08,879
and soul. God is my comfort and
my refuge. And from the book of

262
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:12,899
Hebrews, we who have taken
refuge might be strongly

263
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:18,119
encouraged to seize the hope set
before us and again our

264
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:26,719
affirmation. God is my comfort
and my refuge. Okay, now, for

265
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:29,959
those of you, how many of you
were here yesterday in the

266
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,479
workshop? Look around there
really a lot of people here

267
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:36,859
yesterday. I heard as people
were coming in this morning

268
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:42,039
saying, this is one of the best
workshops they've ever been to,

269
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:46,479
not just here, but any of their
workshop journeys. So thank you,

270
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:52,479
Chris. Dr, Chris fish is family.
He's a part of the neighborhood,

271
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:58,239
partly because his mother in law
is our own, Ann Marie, and our

272
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:02,159
bookstore manager, and she first
brought to us the word of Chris

273
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,859
and his books. He comes to us
after over 30 years of being a

274
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:11,339
professor of religious studies
philosopher teaching at

275
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:16,919
Jonestown state, and he's former
Director of Education with

276
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,379
Institute of Noetic Sciences.
Two of his books are down in the

277
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:27,079
bookstore, and he brings to us
wonderful wisdom and insight. So

278
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:31,819
he is our speaker this morning,
and for those of us who want to

279
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:36,979
stay after service, he's going
to do a brief Q and A so you can

280
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:40,239
plan going to the bathroom real
quick, getting some water,

281
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:46,419
coming back upstairs after
service. Okay, so this is the

282
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:51,639
title of his talk today, and we
are going to go into a

283
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:55,359
meditation song, and then Chris
is going to take over from

284
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,039
there. Okay, alrighty. So let's
all stay seated, and let's,

285
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,479
let's dim the light you

286
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:37,880
Speaker 3: I take the time. It
takes me down the road so

287
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:48,460
slowly, and I can't ask bring my
thing and die, but as a folk, I

288
00:34:50,920 --> 00:35:00,060
surrender in the cry, Holy,
Holy. Oh.

289
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:18,120
What a beautiful place I live my
life to see your face. I live my

290
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,540
life to so bright

291
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:40,780
I cannot see. Who would you hope
who isn't? Who would you

292
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:52,240
hold? Who is me? Somebody? Help
me. Help you, please. As I fall

293
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:07,440
down on my knees and I cry,
Holy, holy. Holy.

294
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,020
Unknown: Holy to see your faith.
Live my Life

295
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,560
to see your

296
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:50,979
Speaker 3: face. Face, my

297
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:05,699
Unknown: place

298
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,080
To see

299
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:40,120
Speaker 3: Yo there you

300
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,380
Chris Bache: Good morning,
everybody. I've been told I have

301
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,200
to remember to hold this mic
close up to my face, so if I

302
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,160
drop off, you just shoot your
hand up and remind me it's a

303
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,540
pleasure to be here with you.
Today was Labor Day, I think

304
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,280
Labor Day weekend when I was
here last with you, it's nice to

305
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,980
be back. So the topic today I
like to talk with you about is

306
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,960
no fear of death. And so begin
with meditation. You.

307
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,280
It on the ground, nice and
solid, feel a chair underneath

308
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,020
you, close your eyes, settle
into your breathing,

309
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,540
and in your mind's eye, see all
of us in the room in one large

310
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,280
circle, just transpose us into a
circle.

311
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,060
Take your left hand and put it
on the shoulder and in your

312
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,720
mind's eye, put it on the
shoulder of the person next to

313
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,600
you, so that we're all together,
touching each other, sharing

314
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,840
touch, Sharing the energy of our
lives.

315
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:50,380
Yield that circle and and

316
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:59,920
now bring to mind someone above
who's died, and see them stand.

317
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,020
Standing behind you

318
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:11,940
for more than one and let them
put their hand on your shoulder,

319
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,860
our hand and

320
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:35,360
we've all lost someone, so now
we have two circles. Second

321
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,180
circle is probably larger than
the inner circle. So it.

322
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,340
Now they have also known death,
love, separation from someone

323
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:01,140
they love. So imagine, bring to
mind in your mind's eye, someone

324
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,340
that the person you loved also
lost, and let them stand behind

325
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:17,160
them in the third circle and put
their hand touch the second

326
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,580
circle you

327
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:30,320
wearing older clothes of their
time in history, men and women,

328
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,000
old and young and

329
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:49,779
it now that third generation,
they were separated from someone

330
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:54,459
in death. So we're going to let
the process repeat itself and

331
00:41:54,459 --> 00:42:03,539
repeat itself, adding ring,
touching our shoulders, touching

332
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:08,699
their shoulders and touching
each other until The ring goes

333
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:12,599
back four at the time,

334
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,080
spreading out through history.

335
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:37,220
Feel the enormity of the
community of those who are

336
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,500
united in death and

337
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:56,800
now in your mind's eye, bring to
Mind the next generation, the

338
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,060
children in front of you.

339
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,780
And put your hand on their
shoulder,

340
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:26,480
and then in your mind's eye,
picture their children, and then

341
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:34,520
their children, and again, put
their hand on their shoulder,

342
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,600
and then they put their hand on
the Next Generation shoulder and

343
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:46,840
on the next generation shoulder,
those who have died and those

344
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,800
who will

345
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,180
die Feel the enormity of this
community, and we just started

346
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,040
out from the people in this
room,

347
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:21,320
and feel the naturalness of The
coming and going of life, just

348
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,360
the natural simplicity of the
cycle of birth and death,

349
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:32,000
sharing life experience and
letting it go you.

350
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,640
Reaching back as far as we can
imagine, reaching forward, as

351
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:56,380
far as we can see, far as we can
imagine, the community of life,

352
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,440
the.

353
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,160
And feel in your heart your
oneness with this community,

354
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,240
and relax into

355
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,660
the utter simplicity of this
truth

356
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,560
okay, wiggle your fingers and
toes, bring your awareness back

357
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,580
into your body and back

358
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,220
everybody back. We didn't lose
anybody.

359
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,020
So many things are changing the
world around us, so many

360
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,020
exciting developments, so many
powerful transformative

361
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,460
processes taking place in our
life, and for me as an academic,

362
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,660
one of the great transformative
changes taking place in

363
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,420
universities is around this
topic of is there is around

364
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,700
Death and around the research
which is changing our

365
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,200
relationship to death, because
up until about 30 years ago,

366
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,480
many people believed in life
after death, and many people had

367
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,680
faith in life after death, but
not many people had knowledge,

368
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,020
but they would Consider, you
know, knowledge of that reality.

369
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,120
And today, this is changing. Now
we have so many areas of

370
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,480
research which seem to be
penetrating the veil of death,

371
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,400
and so this pervasive terror
which haunts the modern world

372
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,420
view ever since the rise of
science in the 17th, 18th, 19th

373
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,340
century, with this vision that
the physical world is the only

374
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,520
world that's real, and it all
came about through chance,

375
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,940
screened by necessity, and
there's no meaning to life. And

376
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,520
when we die, when our brain
dies, you know, our

377
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,900
consciousness just disappears.
What a horrible philosophy. But

378
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,200
that is the orthodoxy that's
taught in the university where I

379
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,340
teach, and which is taught in
universities around the world,

380
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,520
and it is all outdated. Even
though it's gospel, it's all

381
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:34,280
passe, it's fading. So what I'd
like to do is just give you a

382
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:40,600
sample of 12 books that I think
give us interesting insights

383
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,200
into this larger cycle of life.
Because if you're afraid of

384
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,160
dying, you really don't know
what life is about. If you're

385
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,600
afraid of dying, you've got it
all backwards. When really it's

386
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,200
when you're born, that's when
the hard work begins, but when

387
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,800
you die, that's when recess
come, that's when graduation

388
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,480
takes place. So if you're afraid
of graduation, then you don't

389
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,340
know what you're doing. So let's
get clear on what we're doing

390
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:13,080
here. So today, I just wanted to
talk about 12 books, and I've

391
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,560
tried to identify the books
which I've shared with my

392
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,960
students through the years,
which have meant the most to

393
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,460
them around the topic of death
in four areas. One,

394
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:31,940
reincarnation research, cycle of
life. Second, near death,

395
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,660
Episode research, what it's like
becoming third, life between

396
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,920
life therapy, which is the
fastest growing area in

397
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,740
hypnotherapy, a subdivision of
past life therapy and fourth

398
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,300
psychedelic research. Now, I
know you may be surprised to

399
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,360
hear that one mentioned here,
because we have a whole lot of

400
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,940
negative conditioning about
psychedelics. We all kind of

401
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,920
went through the Reagan era and
just say no, and we kind of

402
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,700
forgot that for several 1000s of
years, human beings have been

403
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,780
gathering in sacred circles,
using sacred memories, medicines

404
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,380
to remember, help them remember
who they are and recover their

405
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,560
place in the universe. So that's
the context for it. So I just

406
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,500
want to give you three books, or
pick three books in each of

407
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,320
these areas. So, oh, okay,
keeping an eye on the clock,

408
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:30,500
here we go. Three books in
reincarnation research, and I

409
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,520
apologize for putting my own in
the list. We already have it.

410
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,000
Otherwise, other cells by Roger
Wilber, who is a past lives

411
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,480
therapist, is now. He just
passed about a year and a half

412
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,640
ago, and he's so he's in the
bleacher seats. If I am asked,

413
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,440
What's the best single book by
one author who is a past lives

414
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,900
therapist, person, I always say,
who is Roger Wilber? It. He says

415
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,100
he's a wonderful writer. He's
good. He's got a good, solid

416
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,760
grasp on the history of the
tradition. He's a wonderful

417
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:14,280
therapist. He takes you into the
act of helping people recover

418
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,940
their what I call their deep
memory, helping people recover

419
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,160
the deeper sense of who they
are. Helping them remember who

420
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,540
they were before they were born,
helping them trace down the

421
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,780
knots that they find in their
present life. Where did those

422
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,740
knots come from? Some of them
come from their childhood. Some

423
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,060
of them come from a previous
life or a life before their most

424
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:43,180
recent previous life. He just
untangles it beautifully. And

425
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:47,680
then Carl Bohm, who's a nurse
who wasn't really interested in

426
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,120
past lives therapy until her
child started having night

427
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,500
terrors. Her child started
having fears come up in his

428
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,100
dreams. And she got, like any
good mother, she got involved in

429
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,420
helping him untangle those
dreams, and helping him uncover

430
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,020
what was scaring him. And it
turned out what was scaring him

431
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,620
was the memory of a previous
life that was beginning to

432
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,300
bubble up inside his soul. And
he helped her. He she helped him

433
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:21,740
accept that memory, live it. And
then the dreams, the bad dreams,

434
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,640
stopped, and she got involved,
and she began to put something

435
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,760
up on the web, and hundreds and
hundreds of people began to

436
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,060
contact her. And she started
working with children and with

437
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,960
parents of children who
basically have these memories

438
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:41,620
bubbling up. And so she became
kind of a significant writer and

439
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:45,100
Plato in the field, and this is
a wonderful book. It's filled

440
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,340
with lots and lots of case
histories of children

441
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,940
remembering their former lives.
And she talks to parents and

442
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:56,140
helps them understand that this
is a totally natural innocent

443
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,500
thing, and how to help your
child if your child starts to

444
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,280
have these memories which are
not all negative, sometimes

445
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,940
they're very positive, ecstatic
memories, helping the children

446
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,480
integrate those memories into
the larger because what we're

447
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,200
doing is remembering our soul.
That's the soul that's holding

448
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,780
all of those lives and life
cycles. Was the first book I

449
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,940
wrote, which as an academic.
This was my response to Ian

450
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,540
Stevenson's work. His studies
small children from all over the

451
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,780
world, when they begin to talk,
they remember their previous

452
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,140
lives. And he's been able to
document this I've been in I

453
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,680
think Stevenson is the Charles
Darwin of reincarnation theory,

454
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:42,160
and this is my reflection on his
research, bringing it forward,

455
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,560
making it available, and then
asking the question, so what if

456
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,060
reincarnation is a fact of life?
What are the RAM conclusions of

457
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:56,200
living in a reincarnation
universe? And I think they're

458
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,900
profound RAM conclusions,
because if you don't understand

459
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,860
reincarnation, you don't
understand what's happening.

460
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,820
It's impossible to understand
the logic of life, or the wisdom

461
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,600
of life, or the intelligence of
the Creator. If you think that

462
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,160
we only live in life one time,
that's like taking a Sherlock

463
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,920
Holmes novel, pulling one
chapter out of the middle of the

464
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,960
novel, reading it, and trying to
understand what's going on. You

465
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,580
have to sort of think large. You
have to learn to think in the

466
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:32,000
perspective of God. If God would
spend 13 point 7 billion years

467
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,900
evolving a galaxy, why would God
only invest 100 years in the

468
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:42,520
soul? So reincarnation the cycle
of life, but it dissolves the

469
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:46,240
fear of dying when you
understand that dying is

470
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,840
followed by a rest and is
followed by a return, which is

471
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,360
followed by life, which is
followed by death, which is

472
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,080
followed by resting, and then is
followed by return, this

473
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:04,680
Wonderful cycle of life. What's
it like to die? We know what it

474
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,620
looks like on the outside. It's
kind of unpleasant to look at

475
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:10,080
from the outside, but what's it
like to experience it on the

476
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:15,180
inside? Well, let's ask people
whose heart has stopped. Let's

477
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,840
ask people whose brain waves
went flat, and yet our medical

478
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,880
technology pulled it back. Now
we have millions and millions of

479
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,760
people who have gone through
this experience since the Korea

480
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,140
War, where we began to develop
trauma medicine. Here are my

481
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,540
three favorite books in this
area.

482
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,480
The first two were written by
David ring, who was a professor

483
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,280
at University of Connecticut all
his professional life. He's one

484
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,920
of the founders of the near
death episode movement, founder

485
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,880
of the Journal of thanontology.
This isn't his first book

486
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,700
heading toward omega. Is not his
first book. It's his second

487
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,260
book, his first book where he
documented the phenomena of near

488
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,180
death, near death episodes, the
second book he's asking. It,

489
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,620
what's the meaning of near death
episodes? What are we supposed

490
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,280
to learn about life from
studying near death episodes?

491
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,820
And he decided the best way to
do this was to study people who

492
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,720
had the deepest Near-Death
Experience, because not all near

493
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,960
death episodes are as deep. Some
of them are kind of superficial,

494
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,460
some are leading and some very,
very deep. Well, he said, let's

495
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,760
focus on the ones who went
really, really deep, who not

496
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,540
only got out of their body, went
through the tunnel, not only saw

497
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,620
the light, but went into the
light, what he calls core envy

498
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:38,300
ears. And he studies them in
heading toward omega. And

499
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,940
they're wonderful, wonderful
personal accounts. It because he

500
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:47,800
has collected from all over the
world wonderful experiences

501
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,740
people share their stories with
Ken. And he's a he's a wonderful

502
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,180
Archivist of their stories. And
chapter three of Eddie toward

503
00:55:55,180 --> 00:56:00,840
Omega contains 13 people's
experiences, very, very deep

504
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,340
near death experiences, and it
just touches your heart. It

505
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:11,820
touches your soul. These people
have gone into God, and it's

506
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:14,700
clear that they're touching
something profound. And it

507
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,120
changed their life, it changed
their mind, it changed their

508
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,480
emotions, it changed their
values. It changed their

509
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,560
religion, change their their
priorities, and even change

510
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:30,800
their physiology. Having lessons
from the light is Ken's last

511
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,740
book on near death episode
research. So it's kind of a at

512
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,320
the end of the long,
distinguished career studying

513
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,980
these things. This is his last
volume on it really pulls

514
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,600
together the research he studies
near death episodes of those who

515
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,500
are blind from birth, who have a
near death episode, and they can

516
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:53,440
see even though they've been
blind. And there is a chapter,

517
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,160
chapter 13 at the end, where
it's called returning to the

518
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:03,180
source, where he has the deepest
near death episodes and again,

519
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,140
these are spiritual Odysseys
which are just profound. I mean,

520
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:11,760
they're they're just extra
ordinary, and their story is

521
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:17,520
your story. Their story is
yours. And you can feel this,

522
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,940
because when you read it, we've
all die. We've been through this

523
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,380
before, you know, and this is
just remembering. It helps us

524
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,740
remember our experience. It
helps us connect with this

525
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:37,460
larger landscape that life is
part of. Now. What if this is

526
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,860
just endorphin rush from
extinguishing? What if this is

527
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:46,660
really just fantasy? What is it?
This is just kind of a wish

528
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:51,580
fulfilling kind of exercise.
Well, here, let's take a look at

529
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:59,500
this last book pin womel, who's
a Norwegian psychiatrist. There

530
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,400
have been many studies by
scientists of the near death

531
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:06,360
episode experience. I think this
is the best one. It's that if

532
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:11,460
you really, if you have a really
skeptical spouse, or you are a

533
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:15,420
skeptical spouse, and you really
want to look at the near death

534
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,200
episode from a critical,
scientific, philosophical

535
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:25,580
perspective, read this book.
It's just really good. It's

536
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:29,780
hardcore analysis. And his
conclusion is, every attempt to

537
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:34,040
explain away these experiences
fails. They fail to do justice

538
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,920
to the reality experience. When
you get into the detail of the

539
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,320
cases, these things withstand
critical scrutiny, just fine.

540
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,900
Thank you very much. This is one
I get my academic colleagues

541
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,240
when they want to go, Boo Boo
this and Boo Boo that I said,

542
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:55,120
Okay, read this and then come
back and talk to me now, just to

543
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,820
throw a fourth one. And I
couldn't help it, Proof of

544
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:02,280
Heaven. You know, you know, even
Alexander's work, we have this

545
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:07,980
in the bookstore downstairs.
Wonderful, wonderful account.

546
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,860
There are numerous accounts of
one individual who has a

547
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,640
profound near death episode had
guts to write it down, and took

548
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,860
guts for this guy to write it
down, because he's a

549
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,040
neurosurgeon. Everybody knows. I
mean, if the Hindus want to go

550
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,580
to heaven when they die. That's
fine, but Harvard and

551
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:28,400
neurosurgeons do not go to
heaven.

552
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:37,040
It's a very brave and courageous
book. One more area, all right,

553
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,480
trying to stay on schedule here,

554
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:47,980
life between life therapy. What
is that? Well, here are the

555
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:52,240
three books here, and these are
wonderful. We have two over in

556
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,380
the bookstore downstairs. Occurs
to Michael Newton's work. I like

557
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:59,920
Michael Newton's work a lot. If
there were any one single.

558
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,660
Little book I recommend to
people who really want to

559
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:11,280
address the nature of what
happens when we die. I say start

560
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,740
with Michael Luke, because I
know if they read journey of the

561
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,700
soul of souls, they're going to
read destiny of souls. And the

562
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:22,280
two of them really make up one
volume work. Michael Luke was a

563
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,180
past life therapist. He was
doing past lives therapy was

564
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,880
taking people into hypnotic
regression, is healing, helping

565
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,120
people heal by uncovering the
deeper sources of their issues

566
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,500
in this life. And one day, he
gave an ambiguous instruction,

567
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,020
and he found that his client not
only remembered their previous

568
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,860
life, but remembered what
happened to them after they died

569
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,640
in their previous life, they
were able to remember the time

570
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,840
between death and birth. And he
said, Well, damn, that's

571
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,820
amazing. And so he started
taking people back into that

572
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:03,240
life between life state and when
he had taken 600 people. How

573
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:08,280
long does it take you to develop
cases like that? 600 people into

574
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,760
that life, between life state.
He wrote this first book,

575
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,080
journey of souls, and he just
describes what his clients

576
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:21,500
described happening to them. And
then later, a few years later,

577
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,080
he wrote destiny of souls. He
kind of thickens the plot a

578
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,500
little bit, and people were very
interested, and they began to

579
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,380
come to Michael and therapists
coming wanting to be trained.

580
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,280
And eventually he created an
institute where professionals

581
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,640
can come to be trained in doing
life between life therapy. And

582
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,980
that's what's happening in the
third book, memories of the

583
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,720
afterlife, where you have
therapists who have all been

584
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,140
trained by Michael, who
basically there's a short

585
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,500
introduction explaining who they
are and how they got in this

586
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,980
work. And then there's a case
history from their clients, of

587
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:58,300
someone who remembers the time
between life and this is the

588
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:03,060
missing piece of life. Reason I
called my book life cycles is

589
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:07,080
because it life is a cycle, and
right now, we're mostly paying

590
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,500
attention to only one half of
the cycle from birth to death.

591
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,680
But if you don't understand
what's happening from death to

592
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,240
birth, you can't understand the
whole cycle there. There is a

593
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:21,620
logic to it, there is a
progression, there's a de brief

594
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:26,600
time when you die. There is the
return to home, return to source

595
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:32,420
time. And Michael emphasizes,
it's a social time. There is a

596
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:37,520
community in heaven, and there
are community you are part of a

597
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,800
soul cluster. He says, average
number of souls he finds from

598
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,540
his research is 15 souls in a
cluster, and you It's like your

599
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:50,560
class, your matriculation class.
And no matter how many times you

600
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,560
incarnate, no matter many
hundreds or 1000s of times you

601
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,460
incarnate, you always return to
connect with these individuals.

602
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:01,140
They're part of like your soul
family. You go through life

603
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:05,100
together, they don't always
evolve at the same rate, because

604
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,640
some are slow learners and some
are fast learners, but you

605
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,240
evolve together, and they're
guides, and the guides have

606
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,920
guides, and the guides guides
have guides. And he describes in

607
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:22,580
great detail the texture of this
community, and what I love about

608
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:27,620
Michael's work is the detail,
the detail of people who die,

609
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:32,120
who have lived a life so mean,
so vengeful, so hateful, they've

610
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,300
done so much harm, they've hurt
so many people. What happens to

611
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,180
them when they die? And he says,
there's no help. We all go home,

612
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,780
but some people have been so
mangled in life that it takes

613
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,340
special they take special care.
Their energy has to be healed

614
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,240
and realign before they can
return to the community of

615
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,260
heaven. He goes and there are
specialists who work with them,

616
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,960
engage them, intercept them,
hold them, heal them, and help

617
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,400
them find their way back home.
There's just layer upon layer.

618
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:08,940
Michael fills in some of the
missing pieces. And if you know

619
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,700
the spiritual literature, if you
know the mystical literature of

620
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,000
the great saints and sages from
Eastern and Western mystical

621
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,960
traditions, everything Michael
is showing us is coherent and

622
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,240
congruent with what the mystics
have been telling us, the

623
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,840
difference is that now we have
hundreds and 1000s of people

624
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,640
just like you and me who are
going into this territory,

625
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:35,720
instead of being simply monks
and nuns and isolated monastic

626
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:40,480
retreats going into this
territory, the Secret Knowledge

627
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,420
of these things is becoming
public. It's becoming part of

628
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,300
our public record, and it's
becoming part of your students

629
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:50,020
education. In college, if
faculty want to take them there,

630
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,920
and it's it changes lives. I've
just seen so many students, it

631
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,940
changes their lives, because
once you understand what's going

632
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:03,300
on, not only do you lose. Is
your fear of death, but you you

633
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:07,560
grab a deeper meaning to life.
You begin to understand what

634
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,160
your life is about, the
challenges that are embedded.

635
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,700
And by the way, Michael Newton
describes the choices that we

636
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,800
make in order to incarnate what
happens. And he shows how people

637
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,480
know what they're getting into
before they're born, they make

638
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,720
conscious choices to enter the
life they're true they're

639
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,920
entering. Now we might think,
why would I choose a life like

640
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,960
this? Why choose pain and
suffering? Why choose handicap?

641
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:41,680
Why choose early death? Why? Why
choose these things? But you

642
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,740
have to look at life from the
perspective of the soul, not

643
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,340
from the perspective of the ego.
You have to look at the purpose

644
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:52,300
of life from the perspective of
the deep soul's agenda. And the

645
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:57,100
soul's agenda is much larger
than our personal agenda. Life

646
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:01,740
is not about being comfortable.
Life is about becoming more

647
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:07,980
being more challenged, and that
happens to be challenged. And

648
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:15,180
lastly, psychedelic research,
sacred medicine work in the in

649
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,300
the indigenous traditions, they
call these things, not

650
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,440
hallucinogens, because that
implies that the visions which

651
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,820
these trigger are false, but
sacred medicines, and their

652
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:31,160
tradition is that the gods knew
when human beings incarnated,

653
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,060
they would forget. They would
forget who we are and what's

654
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:39,020
going on. And these medicines
help us remember. They help us

655
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:44,680
remember who we are and what the
game of life is. Now I'm not

656
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,740
talking about tripping, though
tripping is interesting and fun.

657
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:53,800
I'm talking about serious psycho
therapeutic work and the van

658
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,580
here, the foremost person is
man, the fellow, the founder,

659
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,040
one of the co founders of the
Transpersonal psychology

660
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,060
movement, along with Abraham
Maslow, is a man named Stanislav

661
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:10,140
Grof, and he's written about
1516, books by now. And this is

662
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:14,640
the him here, one of the great
thinkers of the Transpersonal

663
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,560
psychology movement, and my
favorite three books of his,

664
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,420
particularly pertaining to the
issue of death, what happens to

665
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:27,740
us when we die? Are these three
books. Now, a little warning,

666
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:32,600
this is not exactly easy
reading, just because this first

667
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:37,220
book is LSD psychotherapy. This
is a technical manual written

668
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:41,560
for doctors and nurses and
psychotherapists on the how to

669
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:46,540
manage psychedelic therapy, how
to manage a therapeutic session,

670
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:51,700
low doses, high doses, counter
indications, how to screen,

671
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:56,260
managing the session, managing
after the session. This is, this

672
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:00,600
is not Tim and Lee. Lee. This is
a different this is serious

673
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:06,240
therapeutic work. This is the
modern recovery of an ancient

674
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:13,560
tradition after writing lesson
psychotherapy and writing

675
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:17,100
several books on the clinical
implications for the

676
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,320
implications of psychedelic
research for psychology and

677
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,860
theories of consciousness, and
several intervening work and a

678
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:28,220
book on their work in
psychedelic therapy with the

679
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:32,600
terminally ill, helping them
adjust to the reality of their

680
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,260
impending death. He wrote this
book, The cosmic game. The

681
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:41,980
cosmic game is basically a
discussion of the philosophical

682
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:47,320
and theological ramifications of
psychedelic research. So it's

683
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:52,720
the cosmology book, it's the
it's the big picture. And Stan

684
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,740
has a profound portrait of the
big picture. And not

685
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:00,300
surprisingly, once you
understand it's it's nothing

686
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,440
new. We've seen this before.
We've seen it in the great

687
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,380
mystical traditions of the
world. We've seen it in the

688
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:11,100
great meditation traditions of
the world. Psychedelics is not

689
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:15,180
the issue. Psychedelics is
simply a method, one more method

690
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:19,260
that humanity has used to tap
into the very deep foundational

691
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:23,600
core of our lives and the life
of the universe. Meditation is a

692
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,160
method. Transcendence is a
method. Fasting and isolation is

693
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,720
a method. Silence is a method.
The careful, conscientious use

694
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,920
of sacred medicines is a method
for entering into this reality.

695
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:43,180
The third book, ultimate journey
is specifically where Stan is

696
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:47,620
addressing the issue of death.
And he looks at death from a

697
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:50,980
cross cultural perspective, from
a historical perspective. He's

698
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:54,820
drawing upon South American
traditions, Native American

699
01:09:54,820 --> 01:10:00,480
traditions, Indian traditions
and psychedelic. Research

700
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,100
traditions, bringing it all
together.

701
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:05,760
Is there any mention of
Ayahuasca in any of those books?

702
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,020
Yes, there is. There is now
Ayahuasca basically another

703
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:15,000
psychedelic used. It's used in
Brazil. It's legal in Brazil.

704
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,720
The Brazilian government chose
investigated the communities

705
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:23,600
that were using Ayahuasca. They
chose to keep Ayahuasca legal.

706
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,940
Now, Ayahuasca is legal in this
country. There is a community in

707
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:32,900
Ashland and in Texas, in Houston
that went took the right to the

708
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:36,740
Supreme Court and won the right
to use sacred medicine Ayahuasca

709
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:41,740
in their church. So these are
not renegades. These are not

710
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:44,380
people who are pushing the
outside, you know, just on the

711
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:47,500
outside of society. These are
trying, people who are trying to

712
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,920
help society recover the
powerful agents of self

713
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,620
transformation that has
historically been the role of

714
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,460
the sacred substances. Can they
be a youth abused? Yeah, they

715
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:04,200
can. Were they? Yeah, they were,
but if we have the wisdom to use

716
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,820
them properly, they can be truly
agents of Deep, sacred

717
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:14,340
transformation. And I would just
add the fourth book. My second

718
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,720
book is in this lineage of dark
night. Early on, I'm writing as

719
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:22,160
a philosopher of religion, and I
believe psychedelics are very

720
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:26,060
important to the psychology of
consciousness and understanding

721
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:30,320
the psychology, you know, the
depth of this human psyche, and

722
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:35,180
this capacity to enter into the
mind of the universe at large.

723
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:41,120
So I'm kind of, I'm putting it
out of the line. One of the

724
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,960
things that happens in
psychedelic therapy is just like

725
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,820
in all the other areas, you lose
your fear of death when you are

726
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:54,460
able to tap into who you are
underneath the body, who you are

727
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,540
inside the very essence of the
body and the wonderful universe

728
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:02,700
that gave birth to you have
brought you forward, well, then

729
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,540
you just stop being afraid of
dying. Dying is your best

730
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:11,880
friend. Dying is graduation.
Dying is the culmination of your

731
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:17,220
life. It's part of the cycle of
life. If you read those 12

732
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:21,080
books, if you were afraid of
dying before, I don't think

733
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,960
you're going to be afraid of
dying now, and even if you

734
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,440
weren't afraid of dying, you're
going to really understand the

735
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,100
life process much more deeply if
you read these books. Thanks

736
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:31,580
very much. You

737
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:52,300
Margaret Hiller: Thank you. So
what I hear you saying, Don't

738
01:12:52,300 --> 01:13:01,620
worry behind I hear you saying
that there's much more to our

739
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:07,860
world and to our lives, than
simply getting more living life

740
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:14,160
and leaving life, that there's
an entire spectrum of life

741
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,720
experience in the body and out
of body, that we're Surrounded

742
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:23,840
by a community of heaven. I love
your term for that. The Bible

743
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,920
says a great cloud of witnesses,
like you said, your friends in

744
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:34,640
the bleacher seats. Many of us
here can feel the presence of

745
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,480
our heavenly friends and loved
ones. So I appreciate all the

746
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:46,180
research, personal research and
learning, being mentored with

747
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,960
some of these great thinkers. So
thank you for bringing these

748
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:53,560
ideas to us. You're always
welcome. So let's take a deep

749
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:06,840
breath. We're going to do our
sacred have our sacred

750
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:12,240
opportunity to give tithes and
donations for the ongoing health

751
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:15,660
and well being and continuing of
work with this wonderful

752
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:19,560
community. How many of you know
you're part of an incredible,

753
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,580
beautiful spiritual community
here. And we have many

754
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:29,360
communities, don't we, and some
of our communities blend here.

755
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,660
We have people have their other
spiritual paths, other

756
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:36,140
communities. They come here to
unity, sometimes, all the time.

757
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:40,100
So for our ongoing blessing, we
receive our tithes and

758
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:45,100
donations. I have my tithe check
here. It's my great privilege to

759
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:49,180
be a tither and to tithe on my
paycheck that I am getting

760
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:49,840
today, right?

761
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,680
Okay, so we have a blessing and
a hand Buddha that goes with it

762
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,920

our handful bless us With music.

764
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:11,760
Thank you.

765
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:40,240
And away we go. Did Oh,

766
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:22,040
Chris Bache: it a couple

767
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,440
Unknown: minutes, three, Very
nice for the song.

768
01:16:42,860 --> 01:17:02,980
Chris Bache: Two, you

For Don't worry, You. Don't
worry. Wow.

772
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:33,920
Chris Bache: Don't bring
everybody down. Bring everybody

773
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:42,980
down. Don't worry. Don't worry.
Be happy.

774
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:08,520
Margaret Hiller: I have heard
the story, and I wonder if it's

775
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,120
true that Bobby McCarry received
that message from Mayor vara.

776
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:19,140
Don't worry. Happy. There you
go. Okay, y'all, let's bless our

777
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,440

779
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:31,940
on their faces? Y'all want to
bring your attention to this

780
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:35,240
table over here, Lily has
brought a few of her CDs. If you

781
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,600
want to take the blessing of her
music home, you can see her over

782
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,720
here at this table after
service,

783
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,400
one is blessing will be
happening in here, in the Peace

784
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:57,400
chapel, and tomorrow, I probably
started this work. It started at

785
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,520
the workshop yesterday. I
continue to do my meditations

786
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:06,420
for Susan. I'm ready for you. Me
too. So tomorrow, 11 to one

787
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:11,400
closer walk with God, Susan will
be here supporting us to catch

788
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,040
hold of some of that cheaper
work that she brought back with

789
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:19,320
her from India on this
university. And we are also

790
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,760
doing our annual unity art day.
If you're going to get a table

791
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,180
and you're going to be artist
craftsperson at that event, you

792
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:29,840
need to sign up downstairs on
the lobby sign up sheet for that

793
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,540
art day. Okay? And the
attractions book is downstairs

794
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:38,360
for sale, and I've already
gotten my money back on it with

795
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:44,020
the coupons. I love coupons.
Okay? And next Sunday, we're

796
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:48,160
doing again, a topic out of our
meditation book from the

797
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:52,000
meditation class, opening your
heart, love, compassion and

798
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,240
forgiveness. And I'll just share
with you that we're going to

799
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:58,060
jump off what Chris brought us.
We're going to jump off that

800
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,260
into some really great
information that all came to me

801
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:05,400
was a great download this
morning, and my meditation, yes,

802
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:13,260
okay, all right. And next week,
there will be a possible

803
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,760
repaving of this road out here
in front of the church. They did

804
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:23,600
it incorrectly. Imagine, so
they're going to come and read

805
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,520
pave and restrike. So if there's
a problem parking out here next

806
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:32,300
week, you can park behind the
church. Yes, ma'am, I like to

807
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,000
make it calm that moment. I did
park this morning. I was told

808
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,900
that an individual down the road
is attempting to toe. Okay. So

809
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:44,320
anyway, so there may be some
parking issues next week, you

810
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,280
can Carl pool. You can park in
the back of the church. A few

811
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,940
folks parked at old time pottery
and walked over. It's not a long

812
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:55,600
walk. Or tell us you need a ride
from old time pottery, and we'll

813
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,340
get some folks to do a little
Carl, is that okay? Alright,

814
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,360
here we go. Let's all stand and
make our circle. Where did sue

815
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:03,480
go?

816
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:30,560
Okay, everybody see this? I know
that there are at least. I know

817
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:37,160
there are at least four or five
creative people who want to be a

818
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:42,460
part of decorating the sanctuary
for Christmas. I know you're out

819
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:47,140
here in the circle and Sue,
here's the sign up sheet. See

820
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:51,940
Sue about helping decorate.
December 1 is the first Sunday

821
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:55,240
of Advaita, and that's when we
want our trees done. Okay?

822
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:59,500
Everybody got that? Okay, so
let's say our prayer for

823
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:05,640
protect. Question. This is James
bill at Freeman wrote this, and

824
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,100
we say it for ourselves and all
those we're holding in our

825
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,660
hearts. The light of God
surrounds

826
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:12,780
Chris Bache: us, the love of God
unfolds us. The power of God

827
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,620
protects us, the presence of God
watches over us wherever we are,

828
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:21,300
God is and all is done.

829
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:25,160
Margaret Hiller: After you say
it a couple 1000 times, you

830
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:30,200
might memorize it correctly, all
right? And now we do our peace

831
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,180
song, We sing it like a prayer
Song,

832
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,660
Chris Bache: guide it all For

833
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:24,620
me, I

834
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:54,400
play. One

835
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,400
Margaret Hiller: more thing, if
you want to stay for a quick QA,

836
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,220
we're going to meet back.

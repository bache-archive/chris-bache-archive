1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Unknown: Okay, okay.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,500
Dottie Koontz: So welcome
everybody. This is the Vancouver

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,620
ions community group, and our
speaker tonight is, I'm very

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,520
excited to have Chris Bache PhD
back to talk about another of

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,780
his areas of contemplation,
which we wrote about in his

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,160
book, life cycles, a study of
reincarnation. Reincarnation is

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,860
a topic that I'm sure people
have different ideas about,

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,120
either believing, disbelieving
or curious based on my own

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,180
contemplation in my younger
years and subsequent personal

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,380
experiences, including a past
life regression in my 20s, I'm

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,660
in the believer camp. Chris, who
was our speaker a couple of

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,400
years ago, was just wonderful.
And as we've said in our check

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,400
ins, that everyone, a lot of
people, have read his book and

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,560
been very appreciative of the
the work that he did and and the

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,220
in the work that he wrote about.
Chris is a professor emeritus in

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,280
the Department of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at Youngstown

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,540
State University, where he
taught for 33 years. He's also

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,600
adjunct faculty at the
California Institute of integral

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,980
studies, Emeritus fellow at the
Institute of Noetic Sciences, on

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,600
the board of the Grof legacy
training an award winning

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,420
teacher and international
speaker, Chris has written four

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,620
books, life cycles, about
reincarnation, dark night, early

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,340
dawn, about pioneering work in
psychedelic philosophy, the

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,400
living classroom, and
exploration of collective fields

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,780
of consciousness in teaching and
LSD in the mind of the universe,

26
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,700
the story of his 20 year journey
with LSD, which is a fabulous

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,940
book. Chris lives in
Weaverville, North Carolina with

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,900
his wife, Christina Hardy, a
professional astrologer and past

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:57,100
life therapist. So Chris take it
away and thank you for being

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,400
here.

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,020
Chris Bache: Hi everybody. Sure
it's nice to see you. And thank

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,780
you for all of your warm
greetings. It really touched my

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,640
heart, and I hope we have a lot
of fun today. I'm looking

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,140
forward today, and because many
of you know my work, I just want

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,860
to show you something which I
think you'd like to see. You

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,060
know, in 19, in 2008 I wrote the
living classroom. I talked about

37
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,660
fields of consciousness, the
transmission, energetic

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,800
transmission. I never meant. I
never mentioned psychedelics.

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,920
Didn't I didn't mention anything
about my psychedelic work. Now,

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,440
Sunni is bringing out that book
in a new edition. So this is the

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,120
new edition just out this coming
month, and it's in expensive and

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,600
hardback, but ebook. It's out in
ebook and it'll be in paperback

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,620
in a year. This is the true
edition of the living classroom.

44
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,560
This time they gave me
permission to talk about

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,360
psychedelics. So this time I'm
actually saying I was a

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,840
university professor for 20
years. I was taking these large

47
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,340
doses of LSD in a therapeutic
setting, and this is what

48
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,760
happened with my students, and
this is the theory of classrooms

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,360
and fields of consciousness that
came out of it. So just to share

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,220
that with you, because this a
special joy, and it kind of

51
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,120
deepens the final puts the final
stitch into bringing back

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,320
together the two halves of my
life that I had to separate in

53
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,620
order to do the psychedelic
work, in order to stay a

54
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,580
university professor in the
world, but to do this work, I

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,140
had to let them separate. Now
they're coming back together

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,360
again late in my life. But
before I published in

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,380
psychedelics, I tackled what I
thought was really a really

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,420
important fundamental question
dividing world philosophies, and

59
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,440
that is reincarnation. If you
believe this is the only life we

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,520
got, you're going to go down a
certain direction. If you

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,800
believe we have multiple
lifetimes, you're going to go

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,700
down a different direction. Seem
to be a fundamental thing. And

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,600
the amazing thing is, after I
got out of graduate school, and

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,200
after I started teaching and I
started to read around more, I

65
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,780
found that we had amazing body
of evidence that documents that

66
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,400
this is a a true and legitimate
part of life. None of my

67
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,300
graduate courses had taken
reincarnation seriously, you

68
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,900
know, not this, not the Western
religions that I studied, not

69
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,620
the scientific traditions that
had displaced those traditions

70
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,040
in my mind. And here was Ian
Stevenson at University of

71
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,420
Virginia proving that
reincarnation is a fact of life,

72
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,320
I had to race my entire
intellectual Blackboard and

73
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,920
start over again, because if
reincarnation is a fact of

74
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,660
nature, then we're living in a
much different universe than I

75
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,260
had thought we were living in
before. So my entire life has

76
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,720
kind of been un. Folding an
understanding of what it's like,

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,160
just like we see, we see plate
tectonics now, and we see

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,420
galaxies giving birth to stars,
and we see planets terraforming

79
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,940
now, there is this understanding
that reincarnation is part of

80
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,480
how nature has carried forward
and advanced the learning of

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,620
individuals within certain
species. Up to that point in

82
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,980
time, evolution is carrying
forward the learning of entire

83
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,140
groups, forward into more groups
and more groups, but eventually,

84
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,660
there reaches a point where
individuality matures and nature

85
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,980
has found a way to fold
individual learning forward into

86
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,660
cascading accumulations of
knowledge and wisdom and

87
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:57,160
experience. Okay, so my first
sabbatical, I wrote life cycles,

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,160
and it starts with a chapter on
the evidence for reincarnation,

89
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
and then it goes on to look at
say, so what if reincarnation is

90
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,140
true? What does it say about our
relationships? What does it say

91
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,260
about family? What does it say
about larger patterns? So, so

92
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,360
what I'd like to do tonight is
share with you this lecture on

93
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,420
gathering together the
scientific evidence for

94
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,100
reincarnation. Now, it turns out
I gave a good lecture on this

95
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,080
topic at an internet European
gathering, World Congress on

96
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,340
consciousness, and it's 35
minutes long. So what I'd like

97
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,700
to do is play that and let that
carry the water for taking you

98
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
through the evidence. I can't
say it better than I said it

99
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,140
here. And I was younger, had
more energy. Was a stage, and it

100
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,940
worked well. And then after 35
minutes, I'll catch it, finish

101
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,900
it out, and then we've got all
the time remaining for

102
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,080
questions, question and answers,
okay, all right, so let's hope

103
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,400
the technology gods are with us.
Fingers crossed, everybody.

104
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:19,080
I hope you're seeing what I'm
seeing, which is, all right,

105
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,560
large screen, and I hope the
sound works.

106
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,220
Unknown: There we go. Okay,
okay,

107
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
Chris Bache: now if I can make
this,

108
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,820
if the most important
philosophical question one can

109
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,260
ask in life is, do we survive
the death of our body, which Dr

110
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,280
Van Lommel is asking, I think
the second most important

111
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,920
question is, do we live once, or
do we live more than once? And

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,300
it all hinges on time. The
problem the significances of

113
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,100
time. As a teacher, if I give a
quiz, I have a right to expect a

114
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,120
certain performance from the
students. If I give an hour

115
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,840
exam, I have a right to expect a
higher level of performance. And

116
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
if I give a take home research
paper, I expect a higher level

117
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,840
of performance because they have
more time if this universe, if

118
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,060
this magnificent universe that
we are in, has a purpose. And as

119
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,020
a philosopher, we can, we have
to measure the purpose of the

120
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,500
universe proportionate to the
time. We have to fulfill that

121
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:46,120
purpose if we only live one
time, then we might extrapolate

122
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,180
or estimate or calculate the
purpose of existence to be

123
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,140
Unknown: but if we live 100

124
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,540
Chris Bache: times, if we live
1000 times, if we Live 10,000

125
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,560
times, if our participation in
this magnificent universe is

126
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,840
truly open ended, then we have a
very different relationship with

127
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,200
the universe, and then we have a
reason to think about the

128
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,660
possible purpose of existence in
a completely different framework

129
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,440
and the religions of the last
4000 years have had a tendency

130
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,980
to not value physical existence.
They've had a tendency to say,

131
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,740
well, you achieve realization,
you achieve enlightenment, and

132
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,340
then you leave Nirvana, Samsara,
you escape. Samsara, moksha,

133
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,680
escape or you achieve salvation,
and then you leave. But that

134
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,140
leaves the fundamental question,
what is the purpose of the

135
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,160
universe unanswered? What is the
purpose of my physical existence

136
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,140
in the universe? But if we come
back, if we come back to this

137
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,280
life many times, then we have a
different story that begins to

138
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,560
unfold, and it doesn't. I think
it. I. I think our understanding

139
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,880
of reincarnation is completely
incomplete at this point, just

140
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,000
as we've begun to understand the
true depth and breadth of the

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,840
universe that we are part of,
likewise, when we begin to

142
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,560
understand that we participate,
we're dancing with this universe

143
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,680
for extended period of time,
then we have a deeper

144
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,620
understanding of what the
universe might actually be

145
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,840
trying to accomplish in us, and
what might be our gift to the

146
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,440
universe in the continual
refinement and compounding of

147
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,640
our talent over time. So what
I'd like to do today is talk

148
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,980
about the evidence for
reincarnation, and I've been

149
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,220
thinking about this and been in
this game for a long time. The

150
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,760
first book I wrote, it was, is
life cycles. And notice how long

151
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,860
ago I wrote it. It was the first
book I wrote as an academic, and

152
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,400
that is a signal of how
important I think this topic is,

153
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,860
and that there is good, critical
empirical evidence that allows

154
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,520
us to decide this topic. If
there weren't critical evidence,

155
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,000
then it would just be a wasted
exercise. And I think this

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,560
evidence did not exist 50 years
ago, and the theologians used to

157
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,180
debate about reincarnation go
round and round, but today we

158
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,540
have a different body of
physical of empirical evidence

159
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,840
on reincarnation that has moved
the topic from the theologians

160
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,560
table to the psychologist table
to the philosopher's table to

161
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,580
the to the psychiatrist table.
And that's what I'd like to take

162
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,940
you through some today. Now when
looking at the evidence for

163
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,280
reincarnation, we can either
look at go small or go large. We

164
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,820
either look at the detailed
cases in or we look at the

165
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,380
larger body of literature. The
Beauty and the real joy is in

166
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:56,140
the detailed cases. But in 45
minutes, I've chosen to go

167
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,660
large. What I would really like
to do is encourage you today to

168
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,680
read one book on reincarnation
that you haven't read yet, and

169
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,960
so I want to take you into some
of the literature on

170
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,840
reincarnation and show you some
of the patterns that are

171
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,220
emerging in the literature and
rebirth. Okay, ready to go.

172
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:23,060
Let's go 20 cases suggestive of
reincarnation, by Ian Stevenson.

173
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,260
This is a book that changed my
life, because, like many people,

174
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,060
when I finished graduate school
in 1978 I was an atheistically

175
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,860
inclined agnostic. I was trained
in philosophy of religion, but

176
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,380
all that training basically made
me an atheist. But when I

177
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,040
encountered this book right
after finishing graduate school,

178
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,160
he turned my life around because
he convinced me that there was

179
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:58,000
evidence that we live on life
more than once. He is the Ah,

180
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:06,120
okay. Oh, good. Steven Stevenson
is the Carlson professor. Was

181
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,300
the Carlson Professor the
University of Virginia between

182
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,600
1967 and 2001 he has written 11
books on reincarnation. Some of

183
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,380
the most important are these
cases of reincarnation type

184
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,400
written over a seven year period
from 73 to 84 unlearn language.

185
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,540
The language is by children
about children who have an

186
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,240
ability to speak a language
which no one in their family

187
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,920
speaks, no one in their entire
town speaks, sometimes an

188
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,780
ancient language, children who
remember previous lives. And his

189
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:53,680
last book, his monumobus, a 1000
page, two volume work, a study

190
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,500
of 187 cases of children who not
only have detailed memories of

191
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,060
their most previous of their
immediate life, but actually

192
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,860
carry the scars in their body
which relate to the death wounds

193
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,280
of the body in their previous
personality. And that, of

194
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,900
course, really upsets academics.
I mean, it's one thing to have

195
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,060
continuity of memory that's bad
enough, but to suggest that a

196
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,140
wound of death can actually be
transferred into the physical

197
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,400
body of a subsequent personality
that drives my colleagues right

198
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,000
up a wall. But 187 cases, well
documented case histories. It's

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,560
a magnificent book. What are we
looking at with Stevenson? We're

200
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,060
looking at cases of children
from around the world who have

201
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,640
detailed recall of their most
immediate recent life. They know

202
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,760
their way around towns that
they've never been in before.

203
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,380
They can recognize persons when
they're brought into the life

204
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,440
place of the previous
personality. They can recognize

205
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,600
persons. Persons that they have
never met before. They know the

206
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,740
personal history, their personal
history with that person. They

207
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,400
have the appropriate emotional
responses with that person.

208
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,380
Husbands. For wives, children.
You have cases of a five year

209
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,260
old child who is showing all the
feelings of the husband of a 35

210
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,420
year old woman with all the
emotional responses. There is

211
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,200
one case of a child called
parmed When he was reunited with

212
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,320
the family of the previous
personality. He was very shy

213
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,560
around the wife of the previous
personality. He wouldn't

214
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
identify her until she left the
room, but then he identified

215
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,720
her, and then later, he took her
aside, and he said two things to

216
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,100
her. He said, I've come but
you've not fixed bindi, which is

217
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,100
the spot that Indian women wear
on their Ford, is an indication

218
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,700
that they're married. And he
also criticized her for wearing

219
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,360
a white saree instead of a
colorful saree. In the tradition

220
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,620
in India is when you become a
widow, you don't wear color.

221
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,220
From the rest of your life, you
wear only white. Essentially,

222
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,980
this five year old boy was
saying to this 35 year old

223
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,000
woman, I've come but you're
acting like you're not married.

224
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,560
They know the inner architecture
of homes that they've never been

225
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,620
in. They know people who owed
them money when they died and

226
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,900
the debt had not been collected.
In one case, this little child

227
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,800
was brought back to the home of
the previous personality, and

228
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,820
the wife of the previous
personality said, Okay, if

229
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,860
you're my husband, where did you
put the will. We couldn't find

230
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,240
the will. The little boy walked
over to a floorboard in the

231
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,180
kitchen, pulled up the
floorboard and pulled the will

232
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,180
out of this little secret place
that only he knew about in the

233
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,880
floor of the kitchen. Cases like
that drive by philosophical

234
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,500
colleagues at the University
right up a wall. They don't know

235
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,040
what to do with it. It's hard
for them deny it, but there it

236
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:12,240
is, some patterns in the data.
The average time interval

237
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,420
between the death of the first
personality and the birth of the

238
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,960
second personality Stevens binds
about two and a half years the

239
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,020
average distance between the
life place of the first

240
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,160
personality and the life place
of the second personality, 50

241
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,320
miles. And these children tend
to lose their memories around

242
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,220
the year, around eight years
old, when they become begins to

243
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,840
get into school and in a more
complex social environment, they

244
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,960
basically forget. They lose
their memory. So we're looking

245
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,920
at a small time window from
research, from about three years

246
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,340
old to eight years old, a five
minute time window to get to

247
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,060
these children and document
their memories. The remaining

248
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,120
90% forget them by the time
they're eight. The remaining 10%

249
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,900
the vast majority of those,
forget them when they hit

250
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,380
puberty, when they hit puberty,
you know, all hell breaks loose,

251
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,740
and they forget their subtle
traces of their former lives.

252
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,400
Stevenson asked, why do these
children remember what most of

253
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,800
us forget? And his answer is, he
doesn't know we need more

254
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:26,060
research. Saul research, he has
a hypothesis. He points out that

255
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,460
about 60% of these children died
violently in their previous

256
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:39,380
life. The remaining 40% died
either early, suddenly or with

257
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,080
an acute sense of unfinished
business, like a mother who dies

258
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,880
shortly after the birth of her
baby,

259
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,460
his hypothesis is, maybe there's
something about the trauma of

260
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,300
being wrenched from life
violently suddenly with an acute

261
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,680
sense of unfinished business
that encodes The consciousness

262
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,800
in a way that draws them back
faster than usual and closer

263
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,980
than usual, because this time, I
don't have time to give all the

264
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,340
evidence, but this two and a
half and 52 and a half years 50

265
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,660
miles, is faster than the
population at Large and closer

266
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,940
to home than the population at
large.

267
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,920
In reviewing 20 cases suggestive
of reincarnation, the Journal of

268
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,000
American Medical Association,
wrote, Stevenson has

269
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,560
painstakingly and unemotionally
collected a detailed series of

270
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,840
cases in which the evidence for
reincarnation is difficult to

271
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,880
understand on other grounds. Two
years later, the Journal of

272
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,940
Nervous and Mental disease, a
major psychiatric journal in the

273
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,720
United States, published an
entire journal devoted to

274
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,740
Stevenson's cases, and that it
was such an unusual move that

275
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,780
they published an editorial to
justify or. Explain their

276
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,160
rationale, and in the editorial
they wrote, Our decision to

277
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,720
publish this material recognizes
the legitimacy of his research

278
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,500
methods and the conformity of
his reasoning to the usual

279
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,700
canons of rational thought.
That's the way an academic

280
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:26,060
qualifies their endorsement. Now
the philosophical institution,

281
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,160
the guardians of Orthodoxy, are
not going to let Stevenson get

282
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,880
away with this, not without a
fight. And he has had his

283
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,340
critics, and the most important
critic is a man named Paul

284
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,480
Edwards. And I promise you, this
is the best picture I could find

285
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,460
of Paul Edwards online his book
reincarnation with critical

286
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,860
examination. Paul Edwards was a
major American philosopher. He

287
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,760
taught at the New School for
Social Research. He's best known

288
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,400
for having been the editor in
chief of the eight volume

289
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,500
Encyclopedia of Philosophy. So
he's a major heavyweight in the

290
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,840
philosophical tradition. He
wrote a series of articles in

291
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,020
1986 to 87 a four part article
on reincarnation. And eventually

292
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,400
he published these articles in a
later form. In this book

293
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,240
reincarnation, in his he is the
harshest critic of Stevenson. He

294
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,820
accuses Stevenson of fraud. He
accuses Stevenson of not being

295
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,020
sufficiently rigorous in his
analysis of the data. He accuses

296
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,260
Stevenson of not actually
verifying that he thinks that

297
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,380
there could have been contact
between the two families as

298
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,040
Stevenson isn't really critical
in proving that these families,

299
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,380
the first and second
personality, have never had

300
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,120
contact. But there's actually a
deeper you know, to to accuse

301
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,860
someone of bad research and to
prove that research two

302
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,640
different things. And if you go
through Stevenson's arguments

303
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,460
very carefully, I'm sorry,
Edwards arguments very

304
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,660
carefully, you see that there's
kind of a deeper logic operating

305
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,440
in his work. He says
reincarnation would represent a

306
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,100
crucifixion of our
understanding. And by our

307
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,840
understanding, he means secular
humanism, the philosophical

308
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,020
scientific tradition, the
Newtonian, Cartesian

309
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,440
philosophical tradition. He
says, If you believe in

310
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,000
reincarnation, you must accept
what he calls six collateral

311
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,040
assumptions. And these
collateral assumptions are that

312
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:47,560
materialism is false, that that
mind is not reducible to brain,

313
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,760
that our identity is more than
our personality, that there is a

314
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:01,500
domain other than space time,
that Death is an illusion, that

315
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,340
there may be a deeper logic to
our lives. Edward says these

316
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,880
assumptions are surely
fantastic, if not indeed

317
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,980
nonsense, and even in the
absence of a demonstration of

318
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,500
specific flaws, a rational
person will conclude either that

319
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,340
Stevenson's reports are
seriously defective or that his

320
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,760
alleged facts can be explained
without bringing in

321
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:36,680
reincarnation. Well, I won't go
over Edwards arguments more

322
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:41,680
carefully, because Robert Robert
almeter has done this for us.

323
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,340
Robert almiter is another major
American philosopher. He is

324
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,520
Professor Emeritus at Georgia
State University. He has

325
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,340
authored, or co authored 24
books. He wrote this book in

326
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,840
which he is evaluating five
categories of evidence for

327
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,940
survival of death. The major
analysis he's doing in this book

328
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,620
is the debate between Stevenson
and Edwards, and what he shows

329
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,640
by analyzing Edwards argument is
that Edwards does not refute

330
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,020
Stevenson's argument. What he
does is refuse to even look at

331
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,760
it seriously, because he is so
convinced that it must be false,

332
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,280
he says his argument constitutes
a blatant bit of question

333
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,600
begging, because he always
assumes precisely what is in

334
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,060
contention. What is in
contention is, Can consciousness

335
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,520
exist without a brain? And
because he believes that science

336
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,580
has proven that consciousness
can exist without a brain,

337
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,480
therefore we know that there
must be something wrong with the

338
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,840
evidence. Albert says if you
have a very commanding argument

339
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,060
that you can that you cannot
refute, then not to accept. The

340
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:08,820
argument is to act irrationally.
Stevenson's tradition continues,

341
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,000
even though he's passed on, he's
now looking from the bleacher

342
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,500
seats, watching us from there.
This book by Tom Schroeder, old

343
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,080
souls. Tom Schroeder wins the
definitely wins for having the

344
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,340
award for having the worst cover
of any book in reincarnation

345
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,840
research. But Tom Schroeder is
an interesting guy. He's a

346
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,400
reporter. He's a Pulitzer Prize
winning reporter. He's also one

347
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
of the editors for The
Washington Post, a major

348
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,360
American newspaper, and he was
interested in whether

349
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,100
Stevenson's research could stand
up to a critical reporter's eye.

350
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,580
So he went with Stevenson on one
of his trips around the world

351
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,540
studying these small children.
He looked over his shoulder, and

352
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:56,500
he came away convinced, as the
subtitle shows, compelling

353
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,200
evidence from children who
remember past lives, convinced

354
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,040
that this Stevenson's methods
were good, the data would stand

355
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,580
up. These children were real.
This is a compelling case for

356
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,840
reincarnation, and at the
University of Virginia,

357
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,680
Stevenson's work continues in
the person of Jim Tucker, who

358
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,460
has now inherited Stevenson's
chair. This book is a wonderful

359
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,300
book. This is very much in the
Stevenson tradition, continuing

360
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,680
to look in detail the detail
cases, and explaining why these

361
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,740
cases cannot be attributed to
weaker hypotheses like super psi

362
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:44,560
or something like this. I might
mention that Jim Tucker's book

363
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,000
is a lot easier to read than
Stevenson's book. Stevenson

364
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,800
writes and thinks like a lawyer.
It's very good, but it's very,

365
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,240
very detailed, very dry. Jim
Tucker brings a little more life

366
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,900
to the subject matter. Now
everything we've been looking at

367
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,260
so far has to do with what I
would call the evidence from

368
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,400
spontaneous memories, just
children who spontaneously have

369
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,000
memories of previous life. But
there's another body of evidence

370
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,600
you have to approach it with the
different framework. It's evoked

371
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,340
memories, memories which have
been evoked in some way,

372
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,480
different techniques, even
massage, can evoke a former life

373
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,660
memory. But the most common one
that we're familiar with is

374
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,560
hypnotherapy, some type of
hypnosis. The following cases,

375
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,040
following books, are
representative titles of people

376
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,040
who have worked in the field of
past life therapy. My favorite

377
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,720
book, written by a single
therapist who has worked in the

378
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,140
area of past life therapy and
has thought about it a great

379
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,440
deal, is this book by Roger
Wilber. Notice the date an

380
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,440
earlier book, other lives, other
cells, started as a Jung Ian

381
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,580
ended up in past life therapy,
doing past life's work, even

382
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,760
though Carl Jung, I don't know
whether you probably know, he

383
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,700
himself believed in
reincarnation towards the later

384
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,140
years of his life, but he kind
of kept it quiet. This is a

385
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,100
wonderful book, intellectually,
totally competent, a wonderful

386
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,760
review of detailed cases and a
discussion of the implications

387
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,400
of these cases. Past life
therapy began to really explode

388
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,460
in the 70s, 80s, and there were
a lot of therapists who were

389
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,400
concerned that there was not a
graduate school, there was no

390
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,960
curriculum, there was no agreed
upon curriculum for how to

391
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,260
establish the credentials for
people who wanted to do past

392
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,320
life therapy. And this task was
taken on by Winifred Lucas, who

393
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,540
wrote a magnificent two volume
anthology, which is a compendium

394
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,960
of essays and articles of the
best of the best of the people

395
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,060
working at that time in past
life therapy. So if you wanted

396
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:09,060
to read a single book, I would
read Wilbers book by one author.

397
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,820
But if you wanted to see an
overview of multiple people

398
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,480
writing in the field, I would go
to Winifred Lucas's book

399
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,020
regression therapy, a handbook
for professionals.

400
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,020
Carol Bowman

401
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,540
was a social worker. She wasn't
interested in past life therapy.

402
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,460
She got into it because her son
started having nightmares. He

403
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,500
started waking up with very
disturbing nightmares, and she

404
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,260
approached him. She tried to
work with him, took him to

405
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,540
therapist, tried to do
conventional things, but it

406
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,020
didn't work. And then she began
to do her homework. She began to

407
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,260
look into past life therapy. She
began to learn the field, and

408
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,480
she began to help her own child
solve his own trauma carried

409
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,440
over from a previous life that
was. Is both spontaneously

410
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,840
bubbling up in his life, she
began to attract other people

411
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,040
with other children who are also
having problems, and eventually

412
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,480
she wrote this beautiful book,
specifically a therapeutic book

413
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,840
for parents who have children
who are having traumatic memory

414
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,140
surface that they're having
difficulty dealing with, was

415
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,000
very successful, very
persuasive. It really made had a

416
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,540
lot of impact. She got more
business coming in. She wrote a

417
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,440
second book. She gets the award
for the second worst title cover

418
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,840
on reincarnation book, return
from heaven. She's looking

419
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,340
specifically at relatives who
have been reincarnated within

420
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,260
their own families. Now, as a
philosopher, that's a weaker

421
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,100
body of evidence, right? Because
there's so much potential for

422
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,980
contamination if you're
remembering your grandfather.

423
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,240
But as a father, this is
interesting. It's interesting

424
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,240
because reincarnation simply
doesn't happen where it works

425
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,300
well for the researchers, across
great distances and great

426
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,080
families, but inside families is
a very common occurrence, and

427
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:23,420
therefore it deserves to be
looked at and next. Michael

428
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,460
Newton, two wonderful books, and
I must confess a special

429
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,420
partiality if you want to read
some, if you wanted to just pick

430
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:36,320
out one or two books out of this
entire list, I can't help but

431
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,720
wish that you would read Michael
Newton's work. Michael Newton

432
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,160
was a hypnotherapist who got
into past life therapy and was

433
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,660
doing past life therapy, and
then he accidentally discovered

434
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,680
that his clients in deep
hypnosis had the ability not

435
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,520
only to remember their previous
life, but to remember what

436
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,320
happened to them after they
died. They could remember.

437
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,740
Basically, his clients were
beginning to describe the

438
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,820
afterlife, and he thought, he
didn't think this was possible,

439
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,860
but he followed his clients,
good therapist that he is, and

440
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,660
he took hundreds of people into
deep hypnotic regressions, and

441
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,320
he followed them when they would
go through their former life,

442
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,480
and they would go through the
death experience. He would

443
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,980
follow them into their memories,
continuing on, and then he would

444
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,000
ask them questions. And he kept
detailed notes. He would ask

445
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,820
questions about, what was this,
what was going on, what was it

446
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,800
like? And what he found was,
regardless of what background

447
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,180
people came from, whatever their
cultural enculturation was,

448
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:50,680
fundamentalist, Baptist, Karl,
Marxist, atheist, hardcore

449
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,920
scientific reductionist,
whatever their background was,

450
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,060
people were describing the same
fundamental reality in the after

451
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,960
death state. They were
describing a world that had

452
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,760
order, that had structure, that
had logic. There was actually a

453
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,320
social structure. It was a world
in which older learners taught

454
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,400
younger learners. And it was
also a world where people made

455
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,260
the choice to reincarnate as a
conscious, careful decision.

456
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,640
It's one of the most important
choices you make, if you go to

457
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,440
college, what courses you sign
up for, that's an important

458
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,720
choice, because once you sign up
for a course, you're committed

459
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,100
for the entire semester, when
you incarnate, what life you

460
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,840
take on is an important choice.
And Michael Newton found that,

461
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,360
in fact, in the spiritual world,
the choice of what life to take

462
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,520
is a consciously taken choice,
made under the guidance of your

463
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,180
spiritual helpers and made in
cooperation with the other

464
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,080
persons that you're going to be
incarnating with. So before we

465
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:02,580
knew, before we were born, when
we knew more than we know now,

466
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,820
when we were aware of more than
we are aware now, we chose the

467
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:16,440
life that we are living now,
that fact alone just bears deep

468
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,400
Meditation. Two last examples,
not from professionals, they're

469
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,760
from amateurs, but that's what
makes them interesting. The

470
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,940
first is this book looking for
Carol Beckwith, and what makes

471
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,020
it interesting is the man who
wrote it, Robert snow. Because

472
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,980
Robert snow is the commander of
the homicide division of the

473
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,720
Indianapolis Police Department.
All right, so he's chief of

474
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,760
detectives, of he investigates
murders. His opinion is very

475
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,660
important. It must stand up in
court. He would be the last

476
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,300
person that you would think
would be doing research on a

477
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,680
former life. But it happened
that he kind of, he did a hypno,

478
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,360
a hypnotic session not oriented
towards past lives. He just. On

479
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,680
a lark, he did the hypnotic
session, and in this hypnotic

480
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,700
session, he was hit in the face
with a life that appeared to be

481
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,040
his life, but it was, it scared
him to death, and he literally

482
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,200
ran out of the room. But he was
curious, and so he brought all

483
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,600
of his detective skills to the
systematic search to see if he

484
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,860
could identify and track down
whether there was such a person.

485
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,280
And the story of his experience
and the story of his detective

486
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,000
work is told in this short book,
looking for Carol Beckwith. And

487
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
lastly, this book, Soul
Survivor, which you may have

488
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,900
seen it because they did some
news clips, decent news clips on

489
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,820
it, written by Bruce and Andrew
leninga about their son, James.

490
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,120
And this is a case of a child,
three years old, two years old,

491
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,220
who started having spontaneous
memories and trauma, waking up

492
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,660
crying in the middle of the
night, spontaneous memories of

493
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,820
appear, apparently dying in
World War Two as an airplane

494
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:15,540
pilot over the over the coast of
Japan. And his father was a

495
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,200
fundamentalist Baptist, and he
was absolutely, vehemently

496
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,760
opposed to his son.
Reincarnating mother was a

497
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,540
little more receptive. So they
got involved in first they

498
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,400
wanted to help their son, but he
got involved in the the inquiry

499
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,260
because he wanted to disprove
reincarnation, whatever was

500
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,120
going on with James. He wanted
to disprove reincarnation to

501
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:46,900
protect his faith. In the end,
they tracked down this pilot.

502
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,440
They tracked down the story.
They were able to reunite James

503
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,880
with the people at a military
reunion, with the people who had

504
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,600
served with this pilot. And
James was able to identify

505
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,920
people onto this group. The
father became convinced that, in

506
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,240
fact, his son was a
reincarnation of this pilot, and

507
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,160
reincarnation is true. Now I'd
like to just finish with two,

508
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,820
two observations. Quick
observation says, lunch awaits.

509
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,380
I'd like to emphasize what we
don't know about reincarnation.

510
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,660
The evidence for reincarnation
may be compelling. However, we

511
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,680
don't really know a lot about
how reincarnation takes place,

512
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,300
or what the physics of rebirth
is. We're still beginners in

513
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,840
this at this point, we can't say
what the soul is or what it's

514
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,900
made of. How does it come and go
from the physical body? How does

515
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,760
it interface with our biology
and our genetic makeup? How does

516
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,200
it encode its previous learning
into our present body? And how

517
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,540
does it leave with its learning
intact after we die. These

518
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,320
things right now are beyond our
present grasp. I'm sure we'll

519
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,860
make progress in the future, but
before we do, we're going to

520
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:16,560
have to start we're going to
have to stop reducing mind to

521
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,620
brain, and we're going to be
have to approach this research

522
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:25,220
with a more multi dimensional
metaphysical cosmology. And

523
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,540
lastly, I'd like to point to a
certain paradox in the evidence.

524
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,320
And to do this paradox, I need
to really go back to Ian

525
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,420
Stevenson, Stevenson's evidence,
I think, is the most powerful

526
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,220
evidence for reincarnation, and
his evidence liberates our

527
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,360
thinking at one level, but it
also constricts our thinking at

528
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,100
another, because the strongest
evidence for reincarnation comes

529
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,740
from lives that show the
tightest connection, the

530
00:38:53,740 --> 00:39:00,360
tightest correlation. But the
correlation can be so tight it

531
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,660
can lead, if you just study
Stevenson's evidence, it can

532
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,380
lead to a

533
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,280
anemic an under developed vision
of what life is like when we

534
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,880
die, when most of us die. In
that respect, we must remember

535
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,900
that Stevenson's cases are not
typical cases. These children

536
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,120
are coming back very fast and
very close to home. Most people

537
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,780
spend much more quote time in
the timeless condition of the

538
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:33,740
spirit world. They have a much
wider breadth of experiences. So

539
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,500
Stevenson's evidence liberates
us to thinking about the soul

540
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,120
and thinking about our lives and
thinking about our existence in

541
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,900
a much larger, expanded
framework, but in order to

542
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,460
actually fill in that Canvas, in
order to actually explore more

543
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,420
deeply what happens to us when
we die, and what the larger

544
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,780
circle of life is like, from
expanded consciousness to

545
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,400
contracted conscious. And back
into expanded consciousness, we

546
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,000
need to look at other bodies of
data. I think Michael Newton's

547
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,060
work is an important body of
data that gives us a larger

548
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,300
vision. And this afternoon, when
I talk about psychedelic

549
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,840
research, I'll look at another
body of data, which I think can

550
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,240
give us an expanded vision of
our life in this universe. Thank

551
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,840
you very much.

552
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,480
Okay, that brings us back.
Brings us back.

553
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,060
Dottie Koontz: Excellent.

554
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,340
Chris Bache: I sure had fun
sharing this with you. It brings

555
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,340
back a lot of memories for me. I
had a good time with this group

556
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:52,060
of people giving this material,
and now you have to picture

557
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,780
yourself. We've just finished
this talk. I'm walking around on

558
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,800
stage with a microphone, waiting
for the questions or

559
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,540
contributions you'd like to make
in the wake of this

560
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,280
presentation, I will just say
that my thinking of

561
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,440
reincarnation has evolved beyond
where it was when I wrote life

562
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,600
cycles. I opened up a deeper
level of reincarnation thinking

563
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,680
in dark net early dawn, when I
began to bring in the

564
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,580
psychedelic experience, and then
in LSD, in the mind of the

565
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:30,320
universe, I give the most
complete expanded understanding

566
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,040
of reincarnation with the birth
of the diamond soul, with the

567
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,680
concept of the birth of the
diamond soul in history. So but

568
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,560
where it all begins is, do we
have good evidence? Do we have

569
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,820
good, reliable evidence that any
good, hard, no skeptic should

570
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:54,400
endorse whether or not they do
or not. So that's some of the

571
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,080
literature, and Dottie has a
core bibliography that she's

572
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,340
going to hopefully send out to
everybody afterwards. So all the

573
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,000
names and places and books that
I mentioned are there, plus

574
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,700
more, so you'll get those. So
now the floor is open,

575
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,980
Unknown: yeah. So if

576
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,640
Dottie Koontz: you'd like to ask
a question, use the little hand

577
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,680
raised thing down at the bottom.
Let's see which one is it react

578
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,460
raise your hand, and we'll call
on you. Victoria, you're the

579
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,340
first. Wow.

580
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,460
Victoria: That was very lovely.
And you, you actually answered.

581
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:36,620
One of my questions was, how is
your understanding evolved? But

582
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:42,820
the two, two questions, you talk
about species reincarnation,

583
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,840
which I'd love to hear more
about that, especially given our

584
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,160
current situation. And I also
would like to understand more

585
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,440
what you mean when you talk in
the book about purification and

586
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:02,220
detoxification, because that
also seems very relevant. And

587
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,820
what does that mean for us,
individually and collectively?

588
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,740
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, when I
began my psychedelic work, I

589
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,820
thought it was about personal
transformation, personal even

590
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,120
maybe personal enlightenment, if
I got lucky. But then, of

591
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,240
course, what happened is that I
dissolved the method I was using

592
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,800
was so powerful. It dissolved me
so deeply into collective

593
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,580
consciousness and the collective
species mind again and again

594
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,800
again, that it began to activate
dynamics at a species level. And

595
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,960
one of the very powerful ones
way down the road was actually

596
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,920
experiencing, it was like I was
in deep space, and I was

597
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,540
experiencing the pulse of life
on our planet. And it was a

598
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,440
pulse that kind of pulsed every
100 years more or less, but it

599
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,580
was a pulse of reincarnation.
And I was experiencing all of

600
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:02,700
human beings as cells in a super
organism. And the super organism

601
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,800
was evolving itself through
their individual life task. It

602
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,740
was just, it was the most
magnificent thing, and it was

603
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,880
beautiful, but it deep, in my
sense, that everything we're

604
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,540
doing is part of a larger
collective dynamic, an

605
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,940
evolutionary dynamic. Everything
we're doing is every what we

606
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,960
think of as a private is not
private. Everything is wired

607
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:35,780
into a collective network. And
that's true of reincarnation in

608
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,040
general, and then in specific
things about when I went into

609
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,900
the ocean of suffering, the
things we get involved in, in

610
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,920
deep spiritual work, some of
it's our personal, some of it's

611
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,100
former life. Some of it's not
personal at all. Some of it's

612
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:59,200
just it's larger, cleaning the
bayou. Now we know from studying

613
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,740
mystical. Autobiographies, when
an individual is opening to

614
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,840
deeper, pure, more
comprehensive, unitive states of

615
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,740
consciousness, those states of
consciousness are incredibly

616
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:19,080
powerful and pure, and they tend
to churn up the psyche and bring

617
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,820
to the surface all the things
that are distorting their

618
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,200
natural ability to enter into
this awareness. So all the

619
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,920
bruises and all the Chee little
things and all the little,

620
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,460
sneaky little things and
whatever, whatever that kind of

621
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,740
mucking us up, comes to the
surface. Well, if that's and

622
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,360
then we process them, and as we
process them, we clear them out,

623
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,200
we let them go. And then our
whole psychic system gets

624
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,360
cleaner and cleaner, and we're
able to not only heal, but to go

625
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,020
into deeper spiritual states of
awareness. So we know mystics do

626
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,020
this. We know meditators do
this. We know people in

627
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,000
psychotherapy do this. Turns out
that this is also true for the

628
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,260
entire species. The entire
species carries the wounds of

629
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,700
its history in its collective
memory banks. The entire species

630
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,420
has lived all these years of
war, has died in all these

631
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:22,160
terrible deaths of plague. Have
all the mothers who have died in

632
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,900
childbirth, anything which isn't
processed out by the present or

633
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,680
future life of that soul stream
is still in this collective

634
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:38,780
psyche, and it still holds
humanity's back, if you will. It

635
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,540
still scares humanity. It still
keeps us focused. And if

636
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:49,420
humanity is as I think it is, in
the process of growing up into a

637
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:56,440
deeper existential level of
awareness, it has to offload all

638
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,320
these things which are keeping
it small, which means it has to

639
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:06,120
purify itself, sweat out all the
mean the first all their pain

640
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,940
that we're carrying as a
collective, all the pain and

641
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:14,460
suffering, all the vicious
wounding of other being, this is

642
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,380
coming to the surface in us,
collectively and as well As

643
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,660
individually. And if you begin
to look like that, then there

644
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:27,200
are certain things that you can
see happening in a culture which

645
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,280
seem to be maybe less as we
thought of them before, as a lot

646
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,960
of individuals manifesting this
thing and kind of more as the

647
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,840
pulse of a deeper process. So I
think we are entering a time in

648
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,460
history of exponential growth.
But exponential growth, watch

649
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,900
out. It requires exponential
purification, exponential

650
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,960
detoxification. But this is
simply how complex systems

651
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:01,380
evolve themselves, how we grow.
So it's it's a very exciting

652
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:07,980
time, very challenging time,
time of exponential growth. But

653
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,420
for that same reason, time that
calls on the Warrior Within us,

654
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,600
the warrior is within us going
to be hard times.

655
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,420
Victoria: Well, just briefly.
Well, I imagine it can be brief.

656
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:26,060
So for me, this brings up so
much emotion. It feels like

657
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:32,960
patriarchy needs to be within,
that I needs to be let go of.

658
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,860
And that seems huge. It feels
like you kind of alluded to the

659
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:42,940
wrong leaders. Who knows? But it
feels like it's being brought

660
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:48,160
up. And so can you just give an
example of what, what does that

661
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,620
mean that that's huge, but
minute to minute, or what, what

662
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,760
does that mean to do?

663
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,480
Chris Bache: We just went
through this election. Now, I'm

664
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,220
pretty sure I'm in a safe room,
but if I apologize, if I step on

665
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,480
people's political tolls, I
apologize. But we had a choice

666
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,780
between a man and a woman and a
particular kind of man with a

667
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,920
particular worldview and a woman
with a particular kind of woman

668
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,680
a particular worldview, and
collectively, we chose, I think,

669
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,040
the worst of the choice. We
chose regressively. We chose

670
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,300
looking backwards. We try. We
chose trying to hold on to what

671
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,900
we had, instead of facing the
uncertainty of the future with

672
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:41,380
vision and courage. And so this
is going to hurt us for years

673
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:47,380
and years, decisions will be
made, things will get worse. I

674
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,800
don't know whether that's a bad
thing or a good thing, that

675
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,160
things are going to get worse
faster than if we had had wisdom

676
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,680
at the leadership level. I don't
know, but I think we're going to

677
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,800
find. It will be years before we
begin to recognize and recover

678
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,360
from the political decisions
that will be enacted over the

679
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,540
next decade under the influence
of this election. So I see it as

680
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,380
we have choice points in this
process. We have choice points

681
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:26,000
of whether to be wise or whether
to be dumb. I'm afraid we didn't

682
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,520
pass this, this intelligence
choice in our country. So

683
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,080
fingers crossed and hands
folded, yeah.

684
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,900
Victoria: So just so for me
individually, keep a focus on

685
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:47,440
the kind of person I want to be
is that, rather than going into

686
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,300
judgment or grief or

687
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,100
Chris Bache: outrage, one of the
things about reincarnation is

688
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,520
that it gives everybody
permission to be at the level of

689
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,260
spiritual development that they
are at, and You kind of lose the

690
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,040
habit of judging other people
because you can't judge other

691
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,060
people because you don't know
what their calling was, what

692
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,480
their challenge was, you don't
you just don't know. You don't

693
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,540
know how old they are. They
could be babies, they could be

694
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,180
graduate students. You just
don't know. So it leads me to be

695
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:28,220
kind of respectfully distant in
that way. So my focus is do the

696
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:33,140
best I can help the people who
see what I see do the best they

697
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,980
can together. I think we will
make a difference. And by the

698
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,780
way, I think as we go into
hotter and hotter, and I don't

699
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,660
mean that temperature wise, but
more and more intense

700
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:49,540
destabilization in the future,
the in the individual can have a

701
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,080
significantly greater impact.
This is we've learned from

702
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:58,060
nonlinear systems and chaos
theory. The more intense, the

703
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:02,520
more nonlinear a system S has
been giant, generating in

704
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,760
instability because it's
absorbing more and more energy.

705
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,600
It becomes unstable at those
highly energized states,

706
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,920
individuals can have a
disproportionate impact. You

707
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,900
know, butterfly flaps at Wings,
hurricane in China. So there's

708
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:23,480
an interconnection of the web as
we go into this crisis, each

709
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,640
individual will have a greater
impact than they might have had

710
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,900
100 years ago, because the whole
foundation is going to be

711
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,740
energized. Victoria, thank you
very much. Thank you for your

712
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,180
good questions. Thank you,

713
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,920
Dottie Koontz: jonai, you're
next. Okay.

714
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,660
Jonai: This has all been
wonderful. Everything I just

715
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:55,660
I've so enjoyed listening to you
to that that whole presentation

716
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,540
that you did, and Victoria's
questions and your answers and

717
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:04,380
everything and past lifetimes
has been so interesting to me,

718
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,700
and I have asked for lifetimes
with certain people. I've been

719
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,520
wounded, I've been actually
killed. I've been, you know, set

720
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:18,360
out to die all kinds of things.
But right now I am get, I've

721
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:22,100
been for the last three or four
years, preparing myself to write

722
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,120
quote memoir, but it's not going
to be the usual type of memoir

723
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,420
book. It'll be in three parts.
In the first 56 and a half

724
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,820
years, of course, will be the
first part, and that'll probably

725
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,300
be the least amount, but I have
to write that without judgment,

726
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:41,260
without blame, clear and and so
on. And so the things that

727
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:46,480
you're saying in terms of what
we have to do for ourselves are

728
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,920
so it's home to me, to me so
much. And I'm, I'm close to

729
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,280
that, and I have been close to
that for a while, but I just had

730
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,820
to figure it out in my mind, how
to say it, how to be it, how to,

731
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,580
you know, present it. And the
second part is all of the all of

732
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,580
the esoteric studies, ancient
wisdom techniques, all of that

733
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,800
kind of thing, past life, stuff
and everything. And the third

734
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,020
part is now.

735
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,240
Dottie Koontz: Jonay, sorry to
interrupt, but do you have a

736
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,960
question?

737
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:30,920
Christopher: I uh, I think I, I
wish I had a question. I can't.

738
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:36,920
I can't. I'm working with all
the answers right now, and the I

739
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,900
guess my question would be, I
want to make a difference.

740
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:46,300
Somehow I feel I can do it with
my writing, with the way that I

741
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:52,360
write, the things that I write
about, and and it's a big, big

742
00:54:52,360 --> 00:55:02,520
task, and I am wondering, you
know, how do I Oh. Build that.

743
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,800
How do I? How do I keep that
focus in spite of what's going

744
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,580
on around us?

745
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:15,360
Chris Bache: Yeah, the life of a
writer is a is a different kind

746
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,780
of life, isn't it? It's like
climb the mountain, close the

747
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,540
door, open the windows, but it's
a deep inner focus, and you hold

748
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:29,900
that focus for a long time. It
took me five years at the

749
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,560
computer to write LSD in the
mind of the universe. It took me

750
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,800
three years just to get myself
in the position of letting

751
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,600
people in as deeply as I was
going to let them in. And then

752
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,040
it took decades, 20 years, just
to gather the experiences which

753
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,260
I put into that book. And so it
is, it's it's a very intense

754
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:55,240
process, and I'd encourage you
just trust your calling. Trust

755
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,240
your calling. If you feel that
that writing is your calling,

756
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,040
it's your contribution, it's
what you can give. Then buckle

757
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,740
in, take it as far, take it as
deep, bring it as deeply into

758
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,820
forward as possible, and then
share it with world. Throw it

759
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:15,840
out there, let it go and dump it
attachment to the results. You

760
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,100
do the best you can. You let it
go where it will go. And that's

761
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,400
a great that's, that's a great
gift.

762
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:26,119
Christopher: Yeah, I set a very
high intention, and the other

763
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:30,079
part of that is to not be
attached to the outcome. That's

764
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,079
the other part of the intention.
But I don't have a long time to

765
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:36,679
do this. I'm 83 years old. This
is something that I'm doing

766
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:39,739
okay, for a legacy for my
family, for one thing, but also

767
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:46,539
I, I want, I want the world to
understand so many things that

768
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:50,859
they're missing right now. And,
of course, we just came up with

769
00:56:50,859 --> 00:56:54,579
a huge challenge in this
election, a huge, huge

770
00:56:54,579 --> 00:57:00,959
challenge. So this is my way of
trying to, you know, address all

771
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:01,439
of that

772
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,340
Chris Bache: pressure cooker is
on, amazing things. Cannot when

773
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,780
the pressure is on, huh?

774
00:57:07,259 --> 00:57:11,639
Christopher: Yes, yeah, it's an
I can do it. I know all of this

775
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:15,659
is happening around me, but I
can do this, but I gotta let go

776
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:16,799
of all that other stuff.

777
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,660
Chris Bache: Good luck to you.
Fingers crossed. Looking forward

778
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,420
to seeing what you produce.
Thank you.

779
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,820
Christopher: And I did read your
life, your life, life cycles.

780
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,300
But if I had read this stuff
sooner, my life would have been

781
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,060
totally different. But I don't
know that I would have wanted it

782
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,420
that way, because part of what I
was doing all those 56 and a

783
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,660
half years was it was, it was my
purpose. It was what I had to do

784
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,100
to move on.

785
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,880
Dottie Koontz: Thank you. John,
a so our next question is,

786
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,600
Christopher,

787
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,860
Christopher: there we go. Thank
you, Tony. Tremendous

788
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,960
presentation. Thank you. Thank
you for sharing that. It's, it's

789
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,200
an honor, and I wish I, I wanted
to go on and hear the rest of

790
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,980
your lecture as well. And I
don't know if you still do in

791
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:13,440
person events or not, but it
would be wonderful. So moving

792
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,620
forward with the with the
question, so as a child, I was

793
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:20,360
taught that I had seen and
therefore I had debt. Later in

794
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,320
life, I moved on, you know, more
sophisticated I thought, and

795
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,640
then I had karma and again,
debt, right? So here we are

796
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,740
again. Then, you know, the idea
with it, reincarnation and karma

797
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:38,300
became entwined, right? And it
was the idea that since you have

798
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,040
karma, you know, you have to
reincarnate to keep working on

799
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,060
this Wheel of Karma, this
reincarnation. So I'd be

800
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:52,060
interested in your thoughts
about is karma really entwined

801
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,700
with reincarnation? Certainly,
you know, for those who have had

802
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,080
the experience of meeting Divine
Presence and source and the

803
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:09,060
incredible love. You know, life
becomes a an honor. You know,

804
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,740
tremendous honor to be here.

805
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:12,780
Unknown: So

806
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,380
Janine: is it, you know, is it
acts of honor and giving back,

807
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:26,000
or is it is reincarnation bound
to karma. Yeah. And the second

808
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,320
part of that being more
recently, I've heard people

809
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,980
saying our karma is being
lessened and going down, and

810
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,560
perhaps we're, you know, if that
theory is correct, that we're

811
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,520
paying that off, and maybe in
the future, we're reincarnating,

812
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,440
because we don't have karma
anymore. Show thoughts

813
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,580
Chris Bache: lot of questions
rolled into those couple of

814
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:59,200
questions, yes, I think of karma
back. I think karma cause and

815
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,820
effect is just. Part of the
process is the physical universe

816
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:06,540
has a lot of cause and effects
running. The spiritual,

817
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,720
conscious universe has a lot of
cause and effect coming. But the

818
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,480
question is, how we interpret
that cause and effect pattern?

819
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,340
And I think we've been kind of
interpreting it in too narrow a

820
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:26,780
way for a long time in the if
you listen to past life therapy,

821
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,800
if you read aloud past life
therapy, you basically could

822
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,360
justifiably come away with
inclusion, that life is

823
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,960
basically about healing, that we
fuck up a lot. We get a lot of

824
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,300
fix up to do, and you could kind
of have a negative perception of

825
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:48,340
what carries over from the past.
There's so much mess up and so

826
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,540
much cleanup that's needed when,
in fact, I think most people,

827
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,020
they pass their karmic test.
Most of the kids in the school

828
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,320
systems, they graduate, they go
to the next level. Most people

829
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,940
pass their karmic test, and that
means we're bringing into our

830
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,140
next life, not just liabilities.
We're bringing in assets, we're

831
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,960
bringing in skills, we're
bringing in relationships that

832
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,380
have matured. So if you but the
people who don't go to

833
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:16,800
therapists to celebrate their
victories, they go to therapists

834
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,020
to heal their wounds. So it's
okay. It's perfectly okay, but

835
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:24,980
we just have to remember there's
a larger pattern here, and so we

836
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,700
have to make sure that the story
which emerges is not just a

837
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:35,000
story of healing, but a story of
investing in human development

838
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,260
and human growth, challenging
ourselves, Developing arts,

839
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,480
talented knowledge, just the
enriching of the human spirit.

840
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:48,460
That is certainly the larger
share of what's happening in

841
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:52,780
reincarnation than simply these
picking over the bones of a

842
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:57,040
grudge here or grudge there. Now
if you look at religion, I think

843
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,420
there's been a similar kind of
damping down in that the

844
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,860
religions of the last 4000
years, the Axial Age, they

845
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:09,540
reflected an intensification of
our getting access to spiritual

846
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:15,480
reality, yoga, meditation, we
were just getting deeper and

847
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,560
deeper first takes in the
spiritual reality. And if you do

848
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,000
have a deep experience of
spiritual reality. How could you

849
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,620
not but think we belong there
more than here? Somehow, there's

850
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:32,180
been an accident that we got
marooned here. The job is to get

851
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:35,900
back to there, right? Christ
will come and save me from my

852
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:39,980
sins. I am stuck in the mud. Get
me back to there. I'll become

853
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:43,660
enlightened. I'll become
awakened. So when I can awake, I

854
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:46,720
can go there, because who wants
to be here? When you can go

855
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,760
there? Okay, I understand that.
I feel the compassion in that.

856
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:57,580
But now that we're beginning to
understand how big here is, how

857
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:03,300
huge it is, how old it is, that
we measure it in light years, in

858
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,680
distances of 6 million, million
miles a year, in one light year,

859
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:11,640
and we're measuring billions of
light years across, and it's so

860
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,840
old, it doesn't really make
sense to really say, Oh, yeah.

861
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,920
And after all of this
evolutionary thrust, just after

862
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,720
5000 years, when we began to be
conscious, just as we begin to

863
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,480
sink down into that
consciousness, which we share

864
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,680
with all of life, and we
discover, oh, my God, my life is

865
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:36,080
one with all of life. Just then
we leave the system, and the

866
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:41,360
system has served its purpose.
No, I don't think so. At least

867
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,140
what came through in my work,
and I find so many people

868
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:50,440
affirming it, and that is, it is
about incarnating deeper and

869
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,980
deeper and deeper, not just
patching up our history, but

870
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:58,960
incarnating the power of spirit,
incarnating Heaven into our

871
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,080
physical bodies, heaven into our
social relationships. It's about

872
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:08,640
giving birth to this deeper
consciousness inside our

873
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:13,080
incarnations. I think we're
giving birth so that the ego,

874
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,380
beautiful thing as it is, the
consciousness that holds our

875
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:21,260
lifetime, is giving birth to the
soul consciousness in the body,

876
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,760
the diamond soul, the whole the
consciousness that holds all of

877
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:32,600
our lifetimes, not as fragments,
but unified as one, fused in

878
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:37,400
one. When all of our lifetimes,
all those 1000s of years, come

879
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:42,220
together and fuse into a
singularity, it gives birth to a

880
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,880
consciousness that is more than
just an enlightened

881
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:50,260
consciousness. It gives birth to
a magnitude of consciousness

882
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,960
which is different. It's 100,000
year old consciousness, and that

883
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,920
is becoming the new operational
consciousness of humanity.

884
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,280
Society to get there, we have to
let go of all the divisions that

885
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,760
we've invoked, all the racism,
all the political divisions, all

886
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,900
the national divisions, all the
class divisions, all that stuff

887
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,220
which we've kept used to keep
separate from each other. This

888
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,240
has gotta. We gotta sweat that
stuff out of our out of our

889
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,960
pores, we have to sweat it out.
And I don't know how long it's

890
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,960
going to take. I don't know how
many generations, but as it is a

891
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,800
multi generational task, isn't
it? It's a multi generational

892
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:35,300
task where somewhere along the
way, we go through gradually,

893
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:41,560
probably a transformation, where
we do something like the

894
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,700
mystics. Do we go through a
death and rebirth? We go through

895
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:53,140
a complete collapse, a surrender
to forces beyond our control. We

896
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:57,700
let go of self interest. We
begin to take on, into our

897
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:02,100
hearts, the needs of other
beings in this crisis where we

898
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:09,600
will all become refugees at one
way or another, the human heart,

899
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:14,460
I think, is going to be opened,
purified, touched, and the human

900
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:18,360
heart that emerges from this
time in History is going to be

901
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:25,820
massive, beautiful, ecstatic,
enlightened, prophetic, Christ

902
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:28,820
consciousness, Buddha
consciousness, profit

903
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:33,260
consciousness, different order
of time. And I think all of us

904
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:37,940
knew what we were getting into
when we chose to incarnate in

905
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:41,800
this part of the century. We
chose to be part of it. We chose

906
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,180
to align ourselves with this
silver movement, not just for

907
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:50,200
our own benefit. It speeds up
our evolution, but it also helps

908
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,380
our children, helps our
grandchildren through this.

909
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:58,600
We're all in this together. So I
think karma is part of the web

910
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:04,260
work. But here's another thing,
those when we are privileged to

911
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:09,600
touch the infinite, the Infinite
is like Ali, Ali, income, free

912
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:16,260
infant is like infinite joy, no
judgment, infinite capacity to

913
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:21,500
transform karma and wrap it up
and throw it away. So this, on

914
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:26,060
the one hand, we learn, we have
to learn. On the other hand, we

915
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:30,620
can learn and let go much faster
than we think we can. We let go

916
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:35,900
these old, stupid, narrow
concepts of God which keep us so

917
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:40,400
imprisoned in our fear and
uncertainty. Let that go. I

918
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,880
think this is an extraordinary,
powerful time. And I do think

919
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,180
you're right. Yeah, I'll tell
you Robert Monroe, his book,

920
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:53,680
Monroe is the Monroe Institute.
His book four journeys. He was

921
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,940
taken into the future. He thinks
somewhere around mid 3000

922
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:04,800
something. AD, and in that
future, when he looked up and

923
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,400
saw the Bardo, there was no
Bardo anymore. There were no

924
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,320
souls in the intermediate state.
It was physical reality, purely

925
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:17,340
open into the Luminosity of
diamond light. And I think what

926
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,560
it teaches us is that the Bardo
our lives that are unresolved,

927
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:26,180
unfinished, and it's individual,
but also collective. I think we

928
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:29,660
are processing our former lives.
We're processing our karma.

929
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,700
We're growing up. We're facing
ourselves in history, and when

930
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:39,860
that happens, we will be much
more transparent to the divine

931
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,140
intelligence, to the Divine
Love, to the Divine information

932
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:48,520
that can help us. When we have
this kind of access, there'll be

933
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,940
no technical problem that we
can't solve, there'll be no

934
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:56,500
social problem that we can't
heal, can't solve, right? That's

935
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:02,580
what I think we're working
towards. So, yeah, thank you.

936
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,520
Thanks for the great question.
Christopher, yeah,

937
01:09:05,879 --> 01:09:10,739
Dottie Koontz: beautiful answer.
So Janine, you're the next

938
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,740
Unknown: questioner. Thank you.

939
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:19,979
Janine: Thank you so much,
Chris. Let's see. I guess maybe

940
01:09:20,579 --> 01:09:24,139
if I put it on gallery, then I
won't feel strange.

941
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:34,280
Unknown: Yeah, thank you so
much. I actually like I have so

942
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:39,320
much in my thoughts right now
that I'm going to try to connect

943
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:48,580
to them. One is, I said to a
friend who used to not have,

944
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,480
like spiritual, expansive
connections, and then her

945
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,960
husband died. And then, you
know, she had experiences, and

946
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,280
she had sort of judged me
before. From my experiences, and

947
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:07,680
what popped out of my mouth is
one person's experience is

948
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:17,160
another person's Woo, yeah,
yeah, you know. And so I think

949
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:22,520
that's important to me, because
I find myself like not wanting

950
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:28,160
to prove anything to anybody,
just because I come from a

951
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:36,560
different world, right, but
simply to experience and share

952
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:43,900
when that feels appropriate and
wow that last response, one of

953
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,920
the things that reminded me of
was having a soul retrieval at a

954
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:53,380
time that I was like at the
lowest time in my life and

955
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,740
completely overwhelmed and
really having a hard time

956
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:03,000
functioning. And in the two day
process. I went from being in

957
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:13,920
that state to so expansive, so
joyful, so so much ease. And so

958
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,240
when you're talking about where
we're going, you know I I'm

959
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,520
like, I'm not going to assume
that we know how it's going to

960
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:27,020
go, and it may be very different
for different people, but things

961
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,820
can happen really fast.

962
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,220
Dottie Koontz: So Janine, do you
have a question?

963
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,840
Unknown: Yeah, I guess, I guess
I was saying these things to

964
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,660
hear responses to them. But one
question, yeah, go ahead.

965
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:45,040
Chris Bache: I think you're very
much right. Soul Retrieval and

966
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,040
what's happening in an
historical situation is very

967
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:52,060
similar. In soul retrieval, we
retrieve alienated split off

968
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:55,780
portions of our soul, and to do
that, we have to heal those

969
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,360
portions and integrate them,
welcome them back into the

970
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:02,820
unity. I think the same thing is
happening in our historical

971
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:07,080
process, too. We are retrieving
our souls during the whole

972
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:10,740
period of history when we
thought we were egos and we made

973
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:15,540
decisions based on our private,
separate existence. Now we have

974
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,260
to retrieve all those pieces of
injured and what we did to other

975
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:25,772
people so that we can now grow
into a full, manifesting soul.

976
01:12:25,952 --> 01:12:27,092
Yeah, hmm.

977
01:12:28,532 --> 01:12:31,412
Unknown: Other quick question,
and thank you so much.

978
01:12:31,412 --> 01:12:37,172
Appreciate that. I'm curious
whether you've looked at the

979
01:12:37,172 --> 01:12:40,660
work of Nassim Haramein, the
unified field physicist, because

980
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:44,800
I think there's some alignment,
you know, different worlds, yet

981
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,840
some real connections.

982
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,720
Chris Bache: Sounds like it,
doesn't it mean unified theory.

983
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:53,140
I'm up for all for unified
theory. But here's the one of

984
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:56,860
the advantages of being retired
and getting old is I don't have

985
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,900
to keep up with the literature
anymore. So I did. I'm really

986
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,500
behind on, you know, the
literature as such, but the and

987
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,580
you know, Irvin Laszlo work,
Akashic field, field theory,

988
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,520
chaos theory, the work in
fields, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

989
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,480
Fertile Ground.

990
01:13:16,019 --> 01:13:18,599
Unknown: Great. Thank you so
much for all that you're sharing

991
01:13:18,599 --> 01:13:19,199
with us.

992
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,380
Appreciate it. Thank you.

993
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,020
Dottie Koontz: Thank you, Dean,
oops,

994
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:28,400
Norma: Norma, you're, you're up
next. What's your question? I

995
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:35,600
don't exactly have a question,
but I'm, I have been studying

996
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:46,900
myself getting old, and I, I'm
going through a process, and I'm

997
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:52,060
losing my identity. I'm not who
I was each decade, I'm a

998
01:13:52,060 --> 01:14:00,300
different person, and now I'm
losing my identity, and I

999
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:07,740
realized I've, I've been an ego,
and my ego was all that identity

1000
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,220
and now, and also what you said,
Oh, then I said, where, where do

1001
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:21,180
people? I think I'm headed,
maybe toward peoplelessness,

1002
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:26,120
people and I'm wondering if, oh,
maybe this is a question, yeah,

1003
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:33,260
uh, because what I saw when you
were describing the golden

1004
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:42,700
something is Dust, is dust, and
the possibility that humans as

1005
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:48,700
that I will not be human, but I
will be dust, dust to dust and

1006
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:55,300
dust to dust, or whatever it is.
So that is kind of bringing and

1007
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:01,560
I do appreciate dropping in and
getting. Excited about more

1008
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,500
information, so I'll go to the
library and find you.

1009
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,800
Chris Bache: Well, you know,
Nora, your experience of getting

1010
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,720
lighter and lighter and kind of
disappearing that that speaks to

1011
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,680
me. That's my experience, too. I
find that the older I get, and

1012
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,840
I'm 75 now, so you may have a
couple years on me, but I'm

1013
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,160
right behind you. The thinner my
arms get and the weaker my

1014
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:28,880
skeleton gets, it's like it's
falling off. It gets soft and

1015
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,480
it's falling off. And as it
falls off, the memories

1016
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:37,280
associated with get loose and
they can fall off. And I find it

1017
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:42,640
much easier to move into egoless
places than I used to, just

1018
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,200
because my my skin is wrapped a
little loose, you know, my mind.

1019
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,220
And I think we get older, it
gets easier to step into that in

1020
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:55,960
between place. And that's,
that's, that's just kind of and

1021
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,780
it just when, when we get to the
very end, it's a big release,

1022
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,760
and we go light to light,

1023
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,120
Norma: light. That's, that's
what I'm feeling, too, is I'm

1024
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:11,040
getting lighter. You know,
everything is getting lighter.

1025
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:16,200
And I'm excited about the last
breath. I'm hoping I can be

1026
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:19,740
conscious with my last breath.

1027
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:22,879
Chris Bache: You know, all my
life I've been telling my

1028
01:16:22,879 --> 01:16:25,999
children when they're every
little little bit of kids, I

1029
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:31,279
said, it's a great life, and in
the end, you get to die. Death

1030
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,639
is something to look forward to.
Death is graduation. Death is

1031
01:16:34,639 --> 01:16:38,299
coming home. If there, if there
were one thing I wish I could

1032
01:16:38,299 --> 01:16:41,499
give to people, it's give up
your fear of death. If you have

1033
01:16:41,499 --> 01:16:44,439
a fear of death, you've got your
entire metaphysics upside down.

1034
01:16:44,919 --> 01:16:48,399
Birth is when the hard stuff
begins. You should warn the

1035
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:53,199
child, they're beginning first
grade. Death is graduation.

1036
01:16:53,259 --> 01:16:57,339
Death is joy and celebration.
All of our mythology that makes

1037
01:16:57,339 --> 01:17:04,079
death hard difficult goes deep,
nonsense. 99.9% of the people,

1038
01:17:04,139 --> 01:17:09,779
it's a spontaneous into the arms
of the Divine rushing home. And

1039
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:14,519
so if you're clear, I mean, if
you're really clear on what

1040
01:17:14,519 --> 01:17:20,659
birth is and what death is, then
death is something you take into

1041
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:24,799
your heart and celebrate. This
is a life coming to fruition.

1042
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:29,299
You're bringing your soul in
everything you've learned, back

1043
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:33,079
to your core soul. You're
bringing all of your decisions

1044
01:17:33,139 --> 01:17:38,239
back to your core soul. And
that's that's like, wow, that's

1045
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:45,040
Paul: graduation. May not be joy
and sorrow. It may not be joy

1046
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,660
and sorrow, it may be something
whole,

1047
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:52,719
Chris Bache: yeah, bigger than
that, bigger than joy and

1048
01:17:53,139 --> 01:18:00,119
sorrow, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank
you. You bet. Yeah. Thank you.

1049
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,659
Dottie Koontz: Thank you, Norma.
I guess it's my turn, because

1050
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:05,099
Paul here has a question.

1051
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:15,600
Paul: My question was from, as
you've talked about, and you've

1052
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,860
talked about the word
reincarnation. Is reincarnation,

1053
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:25,700
from your perspective, strictly
related to humanity on Earth, or

1054
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:32,900
does it serve a different role
or a greater role in the broader

1055
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:33,680
universe?

1056
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,040
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah, good
question. And you know in my

1057
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,660
writing, you know that my work
really focuses on human

1058
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:44,260
consciousness. And people have
asked me, How come you don't get

1059
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:47,020
really deep into animal
consciousness and plant

1060
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:49,780
consciousness, like a lot of
other shamans and whatnot? And

1061
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:52,900
that's a really good question,
because I know there are fields

1062
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,200
of consciousness related to
plant kingdoms and animal

1063
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,720
kingdoms, and I think the reason
is because, for me, humanity

1064
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:05,160
represents the greatest threat
to all life on the planet. And

1065
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,040
so my work has been really
trying to work with human

1066
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:13,020
consciousness in the belief that
if we can heal humanity, all the

1067
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:16,560
other forms of life will be
safer, will be safe from us.

1068
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,520
Interesting. The cultures that
believe in reincarnation, they

1069
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:24,320
all tend to agree on one thing.
It doesn't begin with human

1070
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:29,120
beings. So they all look to
higher mammalian forms, higher

1071
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:33,080
life forms among the animal
kingdoms, as a bridge over into

1072
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:37,700
human consciousness. So there's
a sense of learning, the basics.

1073
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:42,640
So my sense of it is
individuality is the seed kernel

1074
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:46,840
that makes reincarnation
possible. So I don't look at a

1075
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,380
field of grass and say, Hmm,
there's 10,000 individuals

1076
01:19:50,380 --> 01:19:55,780
there. They all pretty much it's
a collective identity. Somewhere

1077
01:19:55,780 --> 01:20:00,300
along the way, these complex
collective identities. To give

1078
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,420
birth to more and more
individual awareness, self

1079
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:07,920
awareness. In it my dog, I tend
to think that my dog's pretty

1080
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,220
individuated, you know. So
somewhere along the way,

1081
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,820
reincarnation begins as a
learning following, a learning

1082
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,900
and following, and it begins
before human beings, I think.

1083
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:23,780
But nobody knows exactly where,
and nobody knows exactly how,

1084
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:28,400
but it's just an organic,
natural developmental process

1085
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,460
from humans. And I also think
once you come to certain

1086
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:35,780
thresholds, there's not much
point in incarnating at a lower

1087
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:39,920
level. General rule of thumb,
once you can function as a human

1088
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,720
being, not much point in
functioning coming back as a

1089
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:48,220
dog, because the you're at a
quantum jump higher now that I

1090
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,300
don't want to make it make rigid
rules here, but basically it's

1091
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:58,660
kind of like college. Once you
can do once you can do calculus,

1092
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,160
we will not give you a course to
go back and take a course in

1093
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,480
algebra, because algebra, assume
calculus, assumes the knowledge

1094
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,480
of algebra. You can do it if you
want. But we won't give you

1095
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,260
credit for like. It's like that
with, you know, with an

1096
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:16,800
incarnation, we sort of go
through certain developmental

1097
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,720
stages, and once you can
function at that stage, then

1098
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:24,080
naturally you want to function
at that stage and higher, that

1099
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,400
stage and higher?

1100
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:26,540
Unknown: Yeah.

1101
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,080
Dottie Koontz: Thank you. Thank
you. I have one more question

1102
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:33,740
related to that. Is, of all the
books I've read on on

1103
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,060
reincarnation and past lives,
I've not seen one where there

1104
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:42,160
was a reincarnation from or to
another planet or star system.

1105
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:44,500
Do you have anything to say
about that?

1106
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,800
Chris Bache: Well, I'd say, why
not? I mean, like, once you

1107
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,280
understand that the dynamic
principles of evolution are

1108
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,160
being are carrying themselves
out, playing themselves out in

1109
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,980
other solar systems, in other
galaxies, and you run the

1110
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:59,980
numbers, it's kind of like
there's got to be, there's got

1111
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:03,660
to be intelligent life out
there, and if we can incarnate,

1112
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:07,080
then they can incarnate. And
distance is immaterial. And

1113
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:11,460
there are some people who have
conscious recall of having been

1114
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:15,240
a life form in another planet,
and I can't remember her name,

1115
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,380
but there's a woman who does
past life therapy, and this is

1116
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:24,560
her major focus, helping people
who integrate incarnations that

1117
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,400
which are aware from another
lifetime. So if you do a little

1118
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,460
digging around, and I'm sorry, I
just can't remember her name at

1119
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:37,160
present, so I just say, Sure.
Why not I? I personally don't

1120
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:41,500
have conscious recall of such,
though. I will say I was at a a

1121
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:47,560
spiritual workshop. Met a person
there, one of the teachers

1122
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:54,580
there, and he had recall of he I
and one other person there, in

1123
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:59,380
another planetary system, in
another incarnation. So I'd say,

1124
01:22:59,980 --> 01:23:00,540
Okay,

1125
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,840
Dottie Koontz: why not great. So
we have time for one last

1126
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:11,460
question. If anyone, unless you
would like to say, have a last

1127
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,060
say.

1128
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:16,140
Chris Bache: Chris, well, let me
just maybe drop, draw some

1129
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:22,400
things together, unless great,
clearly, reincarnation is not

1130
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,940
doesn't end all your all the
questions to me, reincarnation

1131
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:31,940
just begins a whole rich vein of
questions. It opens up

1132
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:36,080
possibilities because it
relieves us from the terrible

1133
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,800
burden of time. Now, when we ask
ourselves, what do we want to

1134
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:45,580
be? What do we want to become?
We should be thinking in terms

1135
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:51,040
of 10,000 year increments, not
100 year increments. Do you want

1136
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:56,140
to become Beethoven? Do you want
to become a Mozart? Do you want

1137
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:01,200
to become a great poet, a great
artist? Now we have unlimited

1138
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:09,120
time. The universe wants us to
develop all the talents that are

1139
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:16,440
latent within this human form.
So and the diamond soul is going

1140
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:20,220
to function at a much, much
higher level of sensory

1141
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:27,440
experience, vision, much more
refined, intense, clarified all

1142
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,040
the physical senses. It's not
just an open heart, it's not

1143
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:35,480
just an open mind, but the
entire physical body animated

1144
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:42,700
into higher orders of Self
Realization, the Divine is

1145
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:48,100
shoving together, kind of, I
think of it as green reality,

1146
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:52,900
earth and then light, pure
light, spiritual reality. And

1147
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,020
we're just forging more and more
and more and more into each

1148
01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:02,040
other until we become green.
Spiritual Beings filled with

1149
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,520
light, radiating with light.
It's going to take time, but the

1150
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:12,180
pace is picking up and and I
think when the child is born,

1151
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:20,540
when we succeed in bringing this
new, awakened consciousness,

1152
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:24,560
transform consciousness into the
world, like every mother and

1153
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,880
every mother, they will look at
that child, and we will say, it

1154
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:34,280
was worth it. It was worth it to
give birth to this magnificent

1155
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:39,260
being, this Christ Child, this
Buddha awakened child to

1156
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:43,240
humanity, not just here and
there, not just for some special

1157
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:49,720
people here and there, for all
of humanity everywhere. And boy,

1158
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:53,320
don't you know, the women have
to. I think the women are the

1159
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:57,160
key to getting us through this
crisis. Men have had their

1160
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:01,800
chance. We have screwed it up.
We've had our chance women have

1161
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,760
to exercise a greater and
greater share of power to

1162
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,120
reclaim the power that they've
been denied, to bring it fully

1163
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:13,740
forward, and any man worth his
salt will be so glad when that

1164
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:17,700
happens, because we'll know that
half of us is now showing up

1165
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:23,720
fully, and we are stronger when
we're all together, and that's

1166
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,500
basically the message of
reincarnation. We are constantly

1167
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,460
growing deeper community, not
just deeper individuals. We're

1168
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:36,020
growing deeper community. We
have blended all the races in

1169
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:39,800
our body. We've blended all the
different cultures, all the

1170
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,900
different religions in our body.
They're all here. We are the

1171
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:50,260
living consciousness that
incorporates the future human,

1172
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:56,560
which is transnational, trans
racial, trans religious. We're

1173
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:00,540
just there's so many false
identities which are going to

1174
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:04,500
fall away quickly as we make
this and as we make this

1175
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:07,200
transition. Here's one of the
sweet things my last thought to

1176
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:13,500
share with you, we're going to
find that 99% of the work has

1177
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:18,900
already been done. We are just
waking up. The fetus isn't

1178
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:24,500
gestated in the day of labor.
Labor has been long. Most of the

1179
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:29,660
work has already been done. It's
just the last bit, the last

1180
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:34,940
waking up, the last time around,
opening up and letting this

1181
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:40,420
birth take place. I think if
this is the century, it'll

1182
01:27:40,420 --> 01:27:45,400
happen this century. It has to.
We don't have time. Not have

1183
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:52,480
time. Yeah. Thank you very much
for giving it such a big slice

1184
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,480
of your day and having this time
for us to spend together.

1185
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:00,160
Really, it's such wonderful
experience to know and hope that

1186
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:05,880
you take the work and take it
out among your friends and share

1187
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,060
the book, share the work. It's a
real honor. Thank you.

1188
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:12,180
Dottie Koontz: Thank you, Chris.
That was That was fabulous. I'm

1189
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:16,080
going to put it on gallery view,
and if you want to unmute

1190
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,840
yourself and say goodbye to
Chris and everyone else, thank

1191
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:24,440
you all for coming. This has
been fabulous, wonderful. Thank

1192
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:24,860
you.

1193
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,080
Jonai: Thank you so much. Thank
you so much. Thank you so much.

1194
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:33,020
Unknown: Thank you, Chris and
thank you. Dottie,

1195
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,860
Dottie Koontz: beautiful. Rest
of your day. Yeah, Chris, I have

1196
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:37,040
one

1197
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,840
Unknown: question, can you say
your last name?

1198
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:47,920
Chris Bache: Thank you. Thank
you. Bye.

Unknown: universe petition I

3
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,260
Chris Bache: ch Marcus, I want
to thank you very much for the

4
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,460
opportunity to be here today and
for the opportunity to address

5
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,000
the time waiver community, which
is certainly such a progressive

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,340
and wonderful community. Martin
mentioned Stanislav Grof. He's

7
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,120
the one of the co founders with
Abraham Maslow of Transpersonal

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,480
psychology, and he's the
foremost authority of

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,500
integrating LSD and other
psychedelic substances into the

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,620
therapeutic process. When I
first read realms of the human

11
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,080
unconscious. His first book, I
read it in 1979 I was a brand

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,800
new young junior faculty member
at the University. As soon as I

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,720
read that book, I realized that
psychedelics would represent a

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,240
turning point, a pivot point,
not only in psychology, but also

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,680
in philosophy, and I was trained
as a philosopher of religion, so

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,700
I made the decision to begin a
psychedelic voyage. I was

17
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,280
convinced that the most
important work which would be

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,700
done in the near future would be
be done by people writing out of

19
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,160
an experiential basis, not
simply an intellectual basis,

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,480
and so I began the process of
doing that experiential work.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,560
Now I have to assume a certain
familiarity with Stan Grof work.

22
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,440
I won't try to describe the
methodology of working with

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,380
psychedelics. It's a very
intense methodology. It's not

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,280
tripping and going to a concert.
It's working in very

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,000
contemplative, isolated
circumstances, isolated from the

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,200
world, with eye shades going
deeply within. I did this work

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,900
over 20 years. Over 20 years, I
did 73 high dose LSD sessions

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,480
using Stan Grof paradigm. I
worked for four years, and then

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,380
I stopped for six years, which
are not part of the story, and

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,240
then I worked very intensely for
another 10 years now. To do this

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,200
work, I had to split my life in
half. On the outside, I

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,680
continued to be a university
professor. I gave my lectures. I

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,740
did the things that university
professors do in my inner life,

34
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,040
I began this very intense
journey, and I kept them

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,580
separate. I kept a firewall
between the two. I You could I

36
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,480
could not talk about my
psychedelic work with Well, I

37
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,180
talked with my friends at the
university, but I never brought

38
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,540
them into my classes. I never
brought it to my students, it's

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,500
only after I've retired from the
university and after I'm passed

40
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,200
the statute of limitations for
doing this work, because I

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,640
stopped this work in 1999 that
I'm able to really bring forward

42
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,920
the philosophical work, the
philosophical significance of

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,460
these experiences. And this is
what I'd like to share with you

44
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:27,920
tonight. I am just finishing a
book that I'm calling diamonds

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,560
from heaven. I don't know
whether this is what it will

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,800
look like, because it's still
being considered by a publisher,

47
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,140
but in my mind, this is how I've
imagined it. Irvin Laszlo has

48
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,080
contributed the forward to the
book, and what I would like to

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,440
do is just basically take you
through some of the highlights

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
of this journey, just little
touches, little scenarios here

51
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,380
and there along the way. And I'd
like to emphasize that I did

52
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,040
this work as a philosopher, not
as a therapist. I wasn't

53
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,500
primarily seeking healing. I was
seeking knowledge of how the

54
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,020
universe works. I saw myself as
pursuing a new philosophical

55
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,560
method, a method that was
pioneered by William James in

56
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,340
the varieties of religious
experience. And this method

57
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,640
consists of basically three
steps, three stages, first to

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,780
enter, to structurally push the
boundaries of your experience in

59
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,760
carefully structured psychedelic
sessions. Second, to come back

60
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,720
and make a phenomenologically
complete and accurate record of

61
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,500
your experiences within 24 hours
after every session, and third,

62
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,220
to critically analyze your
experience, to bring it into

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,000
dialog with other fields of
knowledge, and to compare it

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,260
with the experiences of other
psychedelic explorers. So this

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,500
is what happened. Now. This. Is
only the third time that I've

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,860
tried to speak about these
things in public. So you'll have

67
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,680
to forgive me if I follow my
notes maybe a little more

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,080
closely than I might otherwise
do. A few comments about method,

69
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,020
and then we'll go to the
content. Oh, interesting. The

70
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,880
spacing is different than on my
computer. Most of you are aware

71
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,020
of the difference between low
dose psychely therapy and high

72
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,780
dose psychedelic therapy. When I
was doing this work, I saw

73
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,200
myself doing basically an
extended series of high dose

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,680
psychedelic therapy. The
original protocol in Spring

75
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,640
Grove Hospital restricted
psychedelic sessions to a

76
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,640
maximum of three sessions. What
they were trying to do was to

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,480
trigger a near death type
experience for people who are

78
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,780
approaching their own physical
death. And so I saw, I thought,

79
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,020
whatever could be done three
times safely could be done more

80
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,380
times safely. What I learned,
however, was that while I my

81
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,200
work always stayed within the
bounds of safety, working with

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,460
multiple sessions with high
doses of LSD opened up

83
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,740
challenges and opportunities
that weren't really considered

84
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,120
in the first early stages of
psychedelic therapy. And so

85
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,200
looking back over the course of
my work, I figured I had to have

86
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,560
a different name. I had to find
a different name for it. So I

87
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,360
call it psychedelic exploration.
The method is the method of

88
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,200
psychedelic therapy, complete
isolation, working with

89
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,560
eyeshades, with a sitter, always
with a sitter, carefully

90
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,700
calibrated music to pace the
stages of the opening and

91
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,240
closing of a session. The
difference is the number of

92
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,560
sessions involved. For me, 73
sessions. Over 20 years, I kept

93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,760
detailed records of all of my
sessions. I even tracked the

94
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,080
astral, logical variables of my
sessions, looking at the

95
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,640
correlations between transits
and my session experiences. I

96
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,560
kept meticulous notes over these
years, about 400 pages of raw

97
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,660
experiential data and the story
I'm telling in diamonds from

98
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,140
heaven. And I call it diamonds
from heaven, by the way, because

99
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,960
I wanted to start at the end of
the story. I thought put the

100
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,740
title that indicates where it
ends, but it took a long time

101
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,960
before the diamonds came in. It
isn't really a personal story. I

102
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,960
mean, it is a personal story,
but it's not primarily a

103
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,280
personal story. This diagram
represents kind of a series of

104
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,360
sessions, and they're drawn
overlapping, to emphasize that

105
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,360
one session pretty much starts
where the second session

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,040
stopped. And I found that my
personal experiences, the

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,120
healing experiences and insights
into my personal life, tended to

108
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,540
take place at the beginning and
the end of these sessions, when

109
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,980
I was leaving and coming back
into time and space, but when I

110
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,920
was in the peak of the
experiences indicated by these

111
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,080
large circles, after about the
first 12 or 15 sessions, I was

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,720
operating in a state of
consciousness that was far

113
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,780
beyond personal states of
consciousness, and that's the

114
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,680
story that I'm trying to tell in
diamonds From heaven. That's the

115
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,720
philosophically significant
story, because that's, I think,

116
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,100
the story that in some way we
all share. It's all part of our

117
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,800
collective inherence and
inheritance. It's the

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,480
cosmological story which is the
important story. When one does

119
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,280
this work, one goes through many
cycles, many iterations of death

120
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,000
and rebirth, not just ego.
Death, the first circle this

121
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,200
drop everything below the cross
line takes place below time and

122
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,820
space reality. That bottom line
kind of represents ego and the

123
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,700
first Death-Rebirth cycle, which
I've marked with the

124
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,860
astrological glyphs, kind of in
recognition of Rick Tarnas and

125
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,740
Stan Grof insights into the
correlations between

126
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,160
astrological transits and one's
experiences in Non-ordinary

127
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,380
states, which I only partly
affirm, my experiences affirm

128
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,700
and then don't confirm, but that
first Death-Rebirth takes place

129
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,660
at what Stan calls the perinatal
level of consciousness, And one

130
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,900
moves into deeper states of
consciousness, and then death

131
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,500
and rebirth repeats itself in a
deeper formulation, taking you

132
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,980
into a deeper level of reality
and a deeper level of reality.

133
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,540
Stan Grof follows Ken Wilber in
describing these levels in terms

134
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,780
of psychic, subtle, causal level
reality. I don't have any vested

135
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,740
interest in what scale you use,
and certainly to differentiate

136
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,040
only three dimensions of
consciousness, Transpersonal

137
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,880
consciousness is elementary,
because there are 1000s and

138
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,340
1000s dimensions of
consciousness that one moves

139
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,900
into. But basically, just to
give a suggestion that there are

140
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,460
many levels of. Consciousness
and Transpersonal consciousness,

141
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,260
and one enters these levels of
consciousness in stages. And at

142
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,040
every stage there is a cost
which is exacted. There is a

143
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,640
depth of surrender that takes
place. In the beginning, what's

144
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,360
asked is for you to surrender
your ego. But there are other

145
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,040
types of surrender that take
place at deeper levels of the

146
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,520
journey.

147
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,960
To draw only one circle is to
oversimplify. Sometimes these

148
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,080
indicate numbers of sessions
entering deeper and deeper into

149
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,640
causal reality. There are cycles
within cycles within cycles. So

150
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,080
you can mark of these all as one
cycle. But in fact, there were

151
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,920
cycles within cycles within
cycles as the journey continues.

152
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,080
So the easiest way now is just
to give you the chapters, to

153
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,360
show you the chapters of the
book, and maybe share a few

154
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,420
comments on each of the
chapters. So here are the

155
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,320
chapters of diamonds from Heaven
crossing the perinatal plane,

156
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:09,420
the ocean of suffering, deep
time in the soul, initiation

157
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,140
into the universe, the greater
real of archetypal reality, a

158
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:22,280
benediction of Blessings, the
birth of the future human and

159
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,300
diamond Luminosity. Now there
are some missing chapters.

160
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,940
There's a methodology chapter
and there's a chapter where I

161
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,960
give a typical introduce to a
typical session day. But these

162
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,040
are the chapters that carry the
content of the sessions, the

163
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,780
content of the experiences.

164
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,700
Yes, the first crossing the
perinatal plane is the easiest

165
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,460
to summarize, because it's the
one most people are most

166
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,460
familiar with from reading Stani
grofs work. One goes through

167
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,000
many fetal experiences. One
relives one's experience in the

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,140
womb. One's relives one's own
birth. One goes through many

169
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,980
variations of the death and
rebirth process. My going

170
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,960
through this level took about
two years and 10 sessions, and

171
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,820
in the end, in the ninth and
10th session, the universe, in

172
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,080
my version of ego death, it just
snapped me like a twig. The ego

173
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,100
is on the end, not very
difficult to take apart. It

174
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,060
snapped me like a twig by
turning me into the exact

175
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,020
opposite of everything I had
known myself to be. I entered

176
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,980
the day as a white, middle
class, highly educated

177
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,600
philosopher concerned with the
meaning of existence, and it

178
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,920
just took all of those variables
and reverse them. I went in for

179
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,500
hours and hours experiencing the
lives of women and women of

180
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,460
color from multiple cultures
around the world, women who were

181
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,480
poor, women who had no interest
in philosophy whatsoever. And

182
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,680
yet I was all of these things. I
was all of these beings lives.

183
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,300
It was terribly frightening for
it. It was just scared me to

184
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,820
death. It was the perfect hell
for a male philosopher. There's

185
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,040
nothing wrong with being a
woman, of course, and there's

186
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
nothing wrong with being poor,
and there's nothing being wrong

187
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,040
with being not interested in
philosophy. The issue is, it was

188
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,140
my identification with my
maleness, my identification with

189
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,320
my middle class, whatever,
whatever, which was the problem

190
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,160
is what the universe had to
break in me. And the message was

191
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,360
not simply recover your lives as
women, because I know I've had

192
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,040
former lives as women, this was
different. This was where you're

193
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,540
going. Gender does not exist,
let go. So as part of my entry

194
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,740
into deeper states of
consciousness, my identity as a

195
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,540
male was taken from me, and when
I surrendered and when it was

196
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,120
taken from me, I entered into
the most glorious experience of

197
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,380
womanhood. I experienced
hundreds and hundreds of women.

198
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,800
I experienced all the aspects of
female experiences that I could

199
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,940
imagine. I conceived, I gave
birth, I laughed at my husband's

200
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,440
I wish every man could have the
experience of having such a deep

201
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:25,760
experience of women's lives when
I went into the next phase, the

202
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,800
next two years of work, I
entered a domain of

203
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,400
extraordinary collective
suffering. I entered

204
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,600
systematically deeper and deeper
and deeper. I was taken into

205
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,480
just an orgy of pain and
suffering. It seemed to comprise

206
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,080
all the wars of history, all the
droughts, all the famines. It

207
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,940
was just it was a true ordeal.
In the beginning, I thought that

208
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,420
this represented a deepening of
ego death. I thought that

209
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,260
somehow pieces of my ego. It
slipped through the first death.

210
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,560
And this was somehow a
collective this collective

211
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,920
suffering represented a
deepening of ego death. But

212
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,180
eventually this went on for so
long and it involved so many

213
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,020
1000s and hundreds of 1000s of
beings that I came to a

214
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,100
different conclusion. The
conclusion I came to was that

215
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,220
somehow these sessions were
using something. Was using my

216
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,660
sessions not to heal my private
person. It wasn't about healing

217
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,020
my private life. It was about
trying to heal the collective

218
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,500
psyche of the human race that
somehow all the trauma of all

219
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,860
those wars and all that violence
through history has lodged

220
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,180
itself into the collective
psyche. And at least in this

221
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,600
particular context, one of the
ways that the universe was

222
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,060
trying to heal the human species
was in these expanded states of

223
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,540
consciousness beginning to
siphon and draw out of it

224
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,860
through this awareness, the pain
of the human species, and

225
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:09,720
transform that pain and bring it
into the light. Now, psychedelic

226
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,660
sessions have two halves. There
is the first half, which is the

227
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,300
cleansing half, where I was
experiencing this ocean of

228
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,080
suffering, and then there's the
second half. You go through a

229
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,600
certain amount of work, and the
suffering comes to a

230
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,960
culmination, and after that, the
rest of the session, you're spun

231
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,060
into positive, ecstatic,
Transpersonal spaces. The ocean

232
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,180
of suffering lasted two years,
but actually there was one year

233
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,620
of work. Then I took a six year
break, and then I started

234
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,660
another 10 years of work and the
ocean of suffering, when I

235
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,520
resumed my work six years later,
started exactly where it had

236
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,860
stopped six years before, which
I think is an indication of the

237
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,460
precision and the intentionality
of the intelligence that we are

238
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,580
engaging In these deep states of
consciousness when I came

239
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,700
through the ocean of suffering
in the first half the first

240
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:11,820
year, I entered into what I call
deep time in the soul. I had a

241
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,560
series of experiences in which I
experienced my entire life, from

242
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,740
beginning to end, complete. I
experienced the distilled

243
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,220
essence of everything that I was
in the process of becoming, and

244
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,180
everything that I had become. It
was my entire life complete,

245
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,380
start to finish. And I kept
coming back to it again and

246
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,460
again and again the same system
field, opening up layers more

247
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,360
and more layers, I began to have
insights into the people I was

248
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,480
related to, to my wife, to the
family members. The first time I

249
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,540
entered this state, when I came
out of it, I couldn't remember

250
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,200
any of it. It was the most
meaningful experience of my

251
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,560
life, but I couldn't remember it
when I went back into it, a

252
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,680
second and a third and a fourth
time, however, I began to

253
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,760
remember more and more I could
hold on to more and more of the

254
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,240
experiences. And this is an
important epistemological point.

255
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,020
When you enter these states of
consciousness, you, in the

256
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,320
beginning, will enter into new
states of consciousness which

257
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,880
are so cognitively original you
can't hold on to it. And this is

258
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,800
where I think people talk about
ineffability. But if you keep

259
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,220
going back to the same state of
consciousness again and again

260
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,520
and again, you will remember
more and more. You literally

261
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,240
have to teach yourself how to
stay conscious in these deep

262
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,600
states of consciousness. And you
can teach yourself to stay

263
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,720
conscious in these deep states
of consciousness, it involves

264
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,220
tremendous purification. You go
through one level of

265
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,000
purification after another, but
you can go through and remain

266
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
conscious. Six years later, when
the ocean, when I entered my

267
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,820
work again and the ocean of
suffering resumed that time,

268
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,360
when I went into the ecstatic
portion of the experiences, I It

269
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,840
started in a completely
different space with no

270
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,680
explanation, I entered into what
I call the initiation into the

271
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,280
universe, a series of sessions
that took me deeper and deeper

272
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,540
into the universe and gave me a
carefully calibrated series of

273
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,440
instructions. It was like going
to course, except in this case,

274
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,800
the professor was the universe
itself. Now I give my sessions

275
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,160
names to help me remember them.
When I try to give them a name

276
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,580
that represents the pith of each
session, and I break my sessions

277
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,760
down into bullet points, I'm
trying to remember the entire

278
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,240
session and the entire journey.
And so these are the names of

279
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,380
the sessions that I'm addressing
in initiation into the universe.

280
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,960
Whoop. Sorry. Final visions,
forgot that one. Okay, all

281
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:51,880
right, initiation into the
universe you and I creating. So

282
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,840
it's taken back into the
original point, point of

283
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,800
creation, the cosmic tour. Some
of these are represented you, if

284
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,520
you. Heard these names before
they're in dark night, early

285
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,580
dawn. The Council of Elders
dying into oneness was a session

286
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,600
of repeatedly dying deeper and
deeper and deeper into oneness.

287
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,800
The master plan was the first of
a series of visions that took

288
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,800
place over many years in which I
was being shown what the

289
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,340
universe's agenda was for the
human race. I know it sounds

290
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,720
arrogant. It sounds like ego run
amok to say that, but in my

291
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,460
experience, what I was being
shown was what the evolutionary

292
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,580
trajectory was of humanity and
what the evolutionary agenda was

293
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:51,700
for humanity. Eventually, the
ocean of suffering reached a

294
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,140
level of intensity it's hard to
describe. It culminated in what

295
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,800
I call healing, the collective
wound, just a massive, huge

296
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,360
purification process of
collective healing. And when

297
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,940
that finish, it spun me into an
unprecedented a new level of

298
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,680
reality, a level of reality that
I call archetypal reality, the

299
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,840
greater real of archetype of
reality.

300
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,560
When I first entered archetypal
reality, my identity as a human

301
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:34,700
being began to fall away from
me. I found that there is an

302
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,120
identity that we have as a human
being that is deeper than the

303
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,100
identity we have as a specific
human being, and to enter into

304
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,760
archetypal reality, I literally
had to leave behind the entire

305
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,420
history of human race and the
not just my personal history,

306
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,940
but I had to leave behind the
conditions of human

307
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,100
consciousness images. It imaged
like being in the space station

308
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,280
orbiting above the earth. I
entered a state of consciousness

309
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,020
that was beyond the collective
psyche, and I was being worked

310
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,060
with for months, being taught
how to experience how reality

311
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,100
works at that level, beyond
archetype, beyond the collective

312
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:21,200
psyche. In my experience, there
were two levels of reality that

313
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,140
I experienced at that archetypal
level, one of them at the high

314
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,800
subtle level, one of them at the
low subtle level. At the high

315
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,880
subtle level, which I think of
as kind of the Platonic level. I

316
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,420
encountered living forms that
were responsible for creating

317
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,860
space time and the core
structures of space time, they

318
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,740
were vast. They were huge. My
mind imaged them like galaxies,

319
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,400
billions of light years across.
They were just enormous. I could

320
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,420
not wrap my mind around them.
They were like they were

321
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,900
archetypes, but they were not
like Plato's archetypes. They

322
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,260
were not eternal ideas in the
mind of an unchanging God. They

323
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,500
were living forms that were
changing, but over vast tracks

324
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,080
of time. Subsequently, I went
into lower, subtle level

325
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,940
reality, which is more of a
Jungian kind of level, I entered

326
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,740
into the living tissue of the
collective psyche. I had many

327
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,660
experiences over and over again,
of the wholeness that the human

328
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,040
psyche represents, that it is
even the human body. I had

329
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:33,440
experiences of the archetype of
the body, that all of us are

330
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,700
fractal manifestations of
aspects of and I experienced how

331
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,840
each of us in healing our
individual diseases is

332
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,660
contributing to the archetypal
structure of our human body as

333
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:52,540
it becomes stronger and stronger
through history, I began to have

334
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,640
experiences of reincarnation,
but as a collective process, I

335
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,500
had always imaged reincarnation
as an individual process, where

336
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,340
we individually are developing
our soul's journey. But I began

337
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,020
to have experiences of vast of
the human race as a single

338
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:15,420
organism, incarnating
intelligently, creatively,

339
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,100
intentionally, generation by
generation I was in working in

340
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,000
deep time experiencing the pulse
of humanity's self evolution

341
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,220
through incarnation of billions
and billions of beings every

342
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,680
century, just moving. It was
both simultaneously a Numinous

343
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,240
experience and an absolutely
devastating experience at the

344
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,540
same time to experience all of
humanity with all the

345
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,480
experiences that all of us are
going through in every

346
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,200
generation, to experience that
from the perspective of the

347
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,180
Unified intelligence that was
manifesting as the species and

348
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,740
evolving the species farther and
farther through time, it was

349
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,900
one. No, it gave me a completely
expanded horizon of the

350
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,460
intelligence of the universe.

351
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,000
After spending 18 months
exploring archetypal reality,

352
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,840
which is not long, and I went
through it with very big step.

353
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,800
So what my description is very
incomplete of the totality of

354
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,380
that reality. I entered a year
of extraordinary blessings. It

355
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,420
was, I called it the benediction
of blessings. It was one

356
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,740
blessing after another for an
entire year. These are the names

357
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,080
of the sessions. Oh, I've got to
keep up with my notes a little

358
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,840
bit more. These are the sessions
I dealt with in archetype of

359
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,160
reality. Let me jump back there
for just a second notice how

360
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,240
much cleansing is involved, even
when you're working at such a

361
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,300
deep level of consciousness.
Session 28 was an

362
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,200
extraordinarily positive
blessing. It was my first

363
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,980
contact with causal reality. I
touched this extraordinarily

364
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,020
beautiful, ecstatic state of
consciousness. I was only there

365
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,400
for 30 minutes, but the next
three sessions over six months

366
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,320
were just grueling Ordeals of
detoxification and purification.

367
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,140
What I came to understand is
each deeper state of

368
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,580
consciousness is a higher level
of energy. And when you enter a

369
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,000
deeper state of consciousness,
you you have to acclimate to

370
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,720
that higher level of energy.
Otherwise, your your experiences

371
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,120
there will be fragmented. You'll
be chaotically confused. And so

372
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,340
just that one touch of causal
reality, it took three sessions,

373
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,860
hours and hours of physical
psychological detoxification in

374
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,500
order for me to be able to
return to that state of

375
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,560
consciousness, so I could return
to it more clearly, so I could

376
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,660
stay more cognitively coherent
in that state. This is a pattern

377
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,560
that repeats itself over and
over and over again as you go

378
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,380
deeper and deeper into the
universe, so much so that I

379
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,540
began to dread the session.
After every major breakthrough,

380
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,980
there was a carrying out the
garbage quality every time I

381
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,340
broke through into a new
Luminous state of consciousness,

382
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:27,320
the next sessions were just just
terribly difficult. Now, now I

383
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:34,700
can go into the benediction of
blessings. I present four

384
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,280
sessions in the book. Each of
these was different. The forest

385
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:46,240
was an experience of oneness,
Shunyata, emptiness. It was like

386
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,920
no present, no self present in
me, no self present any in the

387
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,880
world. It's an absolute
transparency to the totality of

388
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,920
life as a living singularity. It
was a deep entry into causal

389
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,440
reality, singing the universe
away, jumping over, singing the

390
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,100
universe away, was an enter into
the primal void. It was an

391
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,960
entering into the Buddha womb,
Satchitananda. It was the

392
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,440
primal, fertile void that
underlies all manifest

393
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,780
existence. Jesus' blood was an
experience of overwhelming

394
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,300
experience of cosmic love. It's
just being drenched in you've

395
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,180
never been loved until you've
been loved like God. You know.

396
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:34,640
It's just just overwhelming
experience of love deeper than

397
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,860
anything I'd ever experienced
before. Let me mention the birth

398
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,280
of the diamond sole just a
little bit longer, because it

399
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:48,100
will come up again later in the
sessions. 11 years previous, I

400
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,640
had had the experience of my
life as a completed whole start

401
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,400
to finish. But in the 40th
session, I began to experience

402
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,780
the integration of all my former
lives they were coming in. It

403
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,160
was like winding A string and
around a kite spool. All my

404
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,300
former lives were coming in fast
and furious, and it was like

405
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,720
winding a string of white light
on a kite spool, and when it hit

406
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,780
a certain critical mass, it
exploded. All those individual

407
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,940
lives fused into one life and
they exploded. It was my first

408
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,180
contact with what I would call
diamond Luminosity. My heart

409
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,740
just ruptured and exploded. My
consciousness jumped far beyond

410
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,400
any consciousness of any
individual life. And I think

411
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,040
what I experienced at that day
was where reincarnation is

412
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,180
taking humanity. Reincarnation
is not adding a little bit

413
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,480
lifetime by lifetime, adding a
few more qualities, a few more

414
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,260
capacities, lifetime by
lifetime, reincarnation is

415
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:58,240
taking us into, I think,
eventually taking us into a

416
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,040
point where all of our former.
Lives, all of our history, all

417
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,040
of our learning, will fuse, and
when it fuses, it lifts us into

418
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,860
the next step in human
evolution, the soul literally

419
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,380
will wake up on earth. Because I
think reincarnation, we die. Our

420
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,840
mind gets large. We are born. We
contract to a small

421
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,640
consciousness. We go from the
soul to the ego, the soul to the

422
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:36,020
ego. But if we keep this up for
1000s of years, sooner or later,

423
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,120
sooner or later, the soul is
going to wake up on Earth, and

424
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,200
when that happens, everything
changes, because the soul

425
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,980
experiences life differently
than the ego does. The soul

426
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,860
experiences a depth of
connection with other beings,

427
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,640
because we've all we've been in
each other's lives for centuries

428
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,900
and centuries, the soul has a
different relationship to the

429
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,080
earth, because the soul knows
that the earth that it leaves

430
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,320
will be the earth it's going to
inherit in its next incarnation.

431
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,440
So it has a whole different
relationship to the issues of

432
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,480
ecology and care taking of the
Earth,

433
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,160
where the sessions went next
chronologically was into the

434
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,600
diamond Luminosity work. But
before I go into that, I need to

435
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,840
backtrack a little bit and talk
about the birth of the future

436
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,900
human. When I started this work,
I never imagined that what I'm

437
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,800
about to describe to you would
become part of it. I was

438
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,500
thinking that this I was doing
this work for my personal

439
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,860
healing, for my personal
transformation, my personal

440
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:54,640
enlightenment, whatever. But
what happened was I started in

441
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,940
the 23rd session, and in
multiple sessions over the

442
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,980
course of the years, I started
to have repeated visions of the

443
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,520
human race, the what was
happening to the human race. And

444
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,580
I think this is a natural
progression, because when you

445
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,940
die as an individual, when you
die as an ego and your

446
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,660
consciousness opens, it doesn't
just open into the oneness of

447
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,060
God. It opens up into the
species that you are, into the

448
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,120
life of the species. And just
like we have a feeling of our

449
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,760
individual age, you enter into
the age of your species. And I

450
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,020
was repeatedly shown that the
human species is coming into a

451
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:41,440
time of a tremendous exponential
explosion in its capacity. We

452
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,300
were coming into a time of great
awakening. So in this chapter, I

453
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,100
present what are six visions
that I call the visions of

454
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,000
awakening, visions that I pull
out of all these other sessions

455
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,420
that I've already presented, and
I just kind of weave them

456
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,740
together to tell, to show, the
coherent story, the story of

457
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,040
this great awakening, the story
of this birth that we are coming

458
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:11,520
into. And I had seen over four
years this story, but it never

459
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,480
showed me how it was going to
pull it off. I never saw how we

460
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,560
were going to make this jump in
consciousness. And then in 1995

461
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,800
a week before Christmas, I went
into I was expecting to go I was

462
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,680
in the diamond Luminosity work.
I was expecting to go one more

463
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,180
time into the diamond Luminosity
state. But instead, the universe

464
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,400
threw me far into deep time, far
into humanity's future, and it

465
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,620
gave me the experience of the
death and rebirth of our species

466
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,820
at a collective level, there was
nothing personal about my

467
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:54,700
experience. I I was the human
species. I was the psyche of the

468
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,780
planet as a whole. I had
dissolved into the collective

469
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:03,600
psyche, and I experienced a
death that took place at that

470
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,240
level. It was a Near-Death
Experience. But for the species,

471
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,240
there was a time we were
overtaken by conditions. It was

472
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,660
a loss of control. It was a loss
of deconstruction. It was a time

473
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,800
of great suffering. I think the
21st Century is going to be the

474
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,760
beginning of the dark night of
our collective soul. It is going

475
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,220
to be the time of the great
undoing. We're going to lose

476
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:31,040
control. We've postponed making
the important environmental,

477
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,080
ecological, cultural decisions
so many times that I think

478
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,020
there's no avoiding the fact
that we are coming to a time of

479
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:45,460
a great global systems crisis.
And just when it had reached its

480
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,200
worst, just when it was at its
worst, it passed. The storm

481
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,700
passed like a hurricane going
over an island. And when we

482
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,880
began to collect ourselves, to
pick ourselves off of the

483
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,680
ground, there was an exponential
growth. Growth of light within

484
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,680
the human species, an
exponential growth in

485
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,400
intelligence, in ideas, in
creativity, in social

486
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,820
formulations, in social formats,
new families, we're springing

487
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:19,500
up. I think that this process
that we are going through is

488
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,300
leading us not simply to
recreate our culture and

489
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,720
recreate society and to create a
new technology and a new

490
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,040
economy. It's literally a
transformation that is taking

491
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,520
place at the core of the
collective psyche. Our

492
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,260
collective psyche is going to
make a shift into a new

493
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,600
foundation, and after that
point, everyone born a human

494
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:49,420
being is going to be operating
out of a new foundation. I think

495
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,640
we truly are becoming a species
of Buddhas, a species of Christ

496
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,540
and prophets.

497
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:09,779
You, after the benediction of
blessings, I was completely

498
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:14,399
content. I mean, I the universe
had asked me to give something

499
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:18,419
in the ocean of suffering, and I
gave it, and it rewarded me with

500
00:36:18,419 --> 00:36:21,139
more joy than I could ever
imagine. It was just an

501
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:27,019
overwhelming joy. I had known
God. I had known the fertile

502
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:30,919
void. It was, it was a
philosopher's dream come true. I

503
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:34,639
had no idea where things would
go, but there were still five

504
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,739
years ahead on the journey and
where it went. It took me into

505
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:44,379
after one more death and rebirth
cycle, it took me into an

506
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:49,599
extraordinarily hyper, clear
state of consciousness. It took

507
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,019
me into the light that I came to
call diamond Luminosity. It's

508
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:59,139
what the Buddhists call
Dharmakaya, the absolute clear

509
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:05,399
light of being. Now I had known
light many times before. Light

510
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,679
comes in, light had come in at
the subtle level of

511
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,739
consciousness. Light had come in
in many different dimensions,

512
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:14,759
but this is a different order of
light when I call it the diamond

513
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:18,719
light. I'm not simply using a
metaphor to describe the light.

514
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:22,699
I'm trying to describe a
particular quality of light, an

515
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:29,059
ultra clear, super luminescent,
just clear, beyond imagination.

516
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:38,359
I entered the diamond Luminosity
four times in the next four

517
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,899
years. Out of 25 sessions, only
four times did I enter the

518
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:48,339
diamond Luminosity. These are
the names that I gave these

519
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:55,299
sessions in between each entry
into the diamond Luminosity, as

520
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:59,079
you can imagine, tremendous
purification, tremendous

521
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:06,239
detoxification, healing the
system just but then I would get

522
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:15,959
spun into another experience of
this diamond light. There were

523
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:20,839
two movements in this process.
There was a progressive entering

524
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:24,679
deeper and deeper into the
diamond Luminosity into the 50th

525
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:28,699
session was the deepest I ever
went into the diamond Luminosity

526
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:37,459
I was in. I was in a state of
deep absorption into pure light.

527
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:44,379
I was light. My boundaries were
lost entirely. I was as I was as

528
00:38:44,379 --> 00:38:50,319
happy as you can imagine a
person being. And just at that

529
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:53,619
moment, something happened that
changed my entire understanding

530
00:38:53,619 --> 00:39:00,599
of life. My visual field pivoted
90 degrees, and in the far

531
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,279
distance I saw reality that was
as far beyond where I was as

532
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:09,119
where I was in the diamond light
was beyond Earth, time, space,

533
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:16,199
and in that reality, I saw
light, and I was hit by a ray of

534
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:21,619
light from that reality. It hit
me and it just shattered me. I

535
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:26,899
call it the absolute light, just
to give it a name. And that's

536
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:32,959
when I understood that it's an
infinite progression. There is

537
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:36,499
no end to the journey. There is
no reaching the end of God, the

538
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:42,819
end of the Divine. Like many of
us, I had adopted the belief

539
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:45,639
that there was an end to this
journey. It had been described

540
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:51,819
differently by different people,
oneness with God, or the super

541
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:55,659
cosmic void, entering the super
cosmic void. But I had entered

542
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,539
the Divine oneness many times,
and I had learned that there

543
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:02,219
were dimensions. Of oneness.
There are different variations

544
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:06,059
within there are depths of one
to oneness. And I had entered

545
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,019
the primal void, but I learned
that there are even depths of

546
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,359
void within void. But I had
always assumed that there was

547
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,839
still an end. I could get to an
end that would be the destinies

548
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,019
the final or stopping point. And
this taught me it's an infinite

549
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:28,399
progression, that there, there
is no stopping point. The Divine

550
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:32,839
is infinitely large, and that's
why, if I were doing it over

551
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:36,799
again, I wouldn't use the same
method that I'd used before. I

552
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:40,959
would be gentler with myself. I
would not push myself so hard to

553
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:45,279
enter so deep, so fast. Even
though 20 years may not be very

554
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,479
fast, I would be gentler with
myself, because now I know that

555
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:53,679
the goal of this work is not to
try to reach some state, some

556
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,519
condition. The goal of this work
is to open up and to let in as

557
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:00,899
much of the Divine into you as
you possibly can, and to allow

558
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:04,199
it to transform your life and to
transform your existence and

559
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,379
everything that you can do with
that awareness in life.

560
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,980
The last year's work is final
visions. These are the sessions

561
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,180
that I address in the book, the
last two visions. The last two

562
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,180
sessions were what I call the
goodbye sessions. I didn't know

563
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,880
I was stopping this work. I was
thought I was going to continue

564
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,300
to do it, but the consciousness
that had always guided my

565
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:41,680
sessions, it choreographed the
ending of our time together

566
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,140
before I knew what was
happening. It gave me an

567
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,380
overview of my entire life's
work. It showed me, in the end,

568
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,560
in this fruits of my labor, how
all of my work fit together,

569
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,680
what the correlations were. And
I used the experiences in that

570
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,820
session to actually organize the
telling of the story in diamonds

571
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,040
from heaven. And then it gave me
a series of last instructions

572
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,940
before we parted. But before
that happened, there was one

573
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,980
serious piece of work to do,
Chapter Seven, seven, session

574
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,140
70. On that session, the
universe put me through a strip

575
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:21,080
down which was one of the
hardest, most deepest, one of

576
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,200
the deepest, most demanding
strip downs that I had ever been

577
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,320
anywhere on the journey I would
not have believed it would have

578
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,040
been possible to go through so
many layers of dying and death

579
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,660
and just complete loose loss of
all reality as I went through in

580
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,980
this session, and after going
through this for an hour and a

581
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,240
half or Two hours that spun me
out into a condition of very

582
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,240
clear state of consciousness,
and it, to make a long story

583
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,600
short, since I'm already at the
end of my time, I'm past time.

584
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,280
I'm sorry. It took me deeper
into deep time than it had ever

585
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,300
taken me before. It took me
deep, deep into a time frame

586
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:04,200
somewhere on the order of 100
200,000 years. And it gave me a

587
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,660
series of experiences that were
the culmination of the birth of

588
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:15,600
the future human. It gave me the
capstone of the story of the

589
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,380
master story of where we're
going. It gave me the deepest

590
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,600
experience that I had of the
being that we are becoming, it

591
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,020
was as if I was taken into the
future and allowed to try on for

592
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,760
size, the being that the
creative intelligence of the

593
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,220
universe is bringing forward on
our planet, such a magnificent

594
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:42,700
being, just an extraordinary
being. It's so important that we

595
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,760
hold a vision of where we're
going, of what is actually

596
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,480
happening. Because as the Dark
Shadows gather in this century

597
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,040
and the century ahead, we could
lose ourselves in despair. We

598
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,620
could lose ourselves in
hopelessness if we don't

599
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:01,200
understand that we are in labor,
we are in labor, and we are

600
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,560
giving birth. And we're not
simply giving birth to a

601
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,980
slightly improved version of
ourselves. We are giving birth

602
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,020
to an extraordinary child, a
child that has never existed as

603
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,520
a species on this planet before.
One of the other things this

604
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,340
experience it taught me was it
gave me a series of lessons, and

605
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,640
it taught me something that was
a missing piece to everything

606
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,160
that I had been given before
about the birth of the future

607
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,780
human it told me that. It showed
me that we are built for speed.

608
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,220
Our species is built for speed.
We have a tendency to think of

609
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,920
human nature, you know, kind of
as a staff thing, human nature,

610
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,900
this. Human nature that but
really, if you step back into an

611
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,260
expanded time frame, and if you
think in terms of reincarnation,

612
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,960
you think in terms of all the
lives that we are winding

613
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,280
around, and then this gathering
of knowledge which is taking

614
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,120
place in the center, in the
archetypal center, when this

615
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,580
center shifts, there. An
exponential jump. And when you

616
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,940
look at the whole evolutionary
dynamic, that evolution, that

617
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,540
reincarnation, makes possible,
it becomes clear that we are

618
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,680
carrying our history on our
backs in much smaller packs than

619
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,680
we had, than we might think, if
we didn't take this large

620
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,840
perspective. We are built for
speed. The human species is

621
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,500
built for speed. We are built
for evolutionary acceleration,

622
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,000
and we are in a tremendously
accelerated time of history

623
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:34,040
right now and before any of us
were born, before we were born,

624
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,240
we knew what we were getting
into. We knew we chose. We knew

625
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,080
what was happening to the human
race. We knew what a hard time

626
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,380
this century was going to be,
and we made a choice to

627
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,460
participate in this time in
history, to be part of this

628
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,480
exciting and dynamic, if
difficult, but this important

629
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,760
progression. Now I'm done. My
time is done. I can't go on

630
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,280
further. I will just very
quickly say when I stopped, I

631
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,540
stopped my sessions for two
reasons, for pain, because my

632
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,320
subtle energy system was over
excited. Was kind of I was

633
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,980
running too much energy, even
though I had done I took a lot

634
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,860
of yoga, did meditation, did all
the things you try to do to take

635
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:21,320
care of yourself. But the main
reason I stopped was heartache.

636
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:28,340
I literally reached a point
where I could not take coming

637
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:35,360
back. I could not take coming
back out of the Divine once you

638
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,380
have dissolved completely into
light, once you have known the

639
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:45,280
joy of being light of
experiencing reality as light

640
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:52,840
time, space, reality can begin
to feel kind of dried up. And in

641
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,020
fact, when I stopped my
sessions, I entered a period of

642
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:00,840
deep, deep sadness. I did a good
job integrating my sessions as I

643
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,260
went, I really worked hard on
integrating my sessions, but

644
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:09,840
when I stopped my sessions, I
entered a deep, deep existential

645
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,040
sadness. And I know that near
death episode people have this

646
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,800
experience. I knew that Carl
Jung had this experience in the

647
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,820
hospital. I knew I was not alone
in this but I had entered so

648
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:28,820
deeply into the divine expanse
that my wound was particularly

649
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,800
deep. Eventually I reached a
point where I knew I was just

650
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,680
waiting to die. I was just
waiting. I was taking care of my

651
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,680
family. I was doing my lectures.
I was, you know, I was doing my

652
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,500
taking care of my
responsibilities, but in my

653
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,400
heart of hearts, I was just
waiting to die so that I could

654
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,100
return to my beloved.
Eventually, I began to realize

655
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,400
that's that's not right. This is
not a good way to live. It's not

656
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,480
not the way this work is
supposed to go. It's not good to

657
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,200
be living your life waiting to
die. So I made a determined

658
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,600
effort to bring myself into my
historical existence again, to

659
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,800
ground myself into time and
space. I learned that somewhere

660
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,960
along the way, I made a mistake.
The mistake I made was that I

661
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,480
had lost the balance between
Transcendence and immanence. I

662
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:29,420
had thrown myself so deeply into
divine Transcendence that I lost

663
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:35,120
my footing inside the imminent
divine, inside the body of God,

664
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,440
inside the physical presence of
God that we all are. It took me

665
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:44,380
about 10 years to get myself
fully grounded back in time and

666
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,220
space and fully kind of
comfortable back in time and

667
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,520
space again. And in this
respect, my experience on this

668
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,800
journey is a cautionary tale.
It's not simply like, you know,

669
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:00,180
the hero's journey, where you go
and you have an adventure and

670
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,840
you bring back with good news.
It's a cautionary tale. It's

671
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,740
Transcendence is a it's a
complicated, paradoxical thing.

672
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,000
A little bit of Transcendence is
good. It's healing. It can, it

673
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,120
can help us understand who we
are and what we are and where we

674
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:20,720
are and what here is. But too
much Transcendence can cause you

675
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,580
to lose sight of an equally
important fact, the fact that

676
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:30,320
the physical world is the
manifest body of the Divine. So

677
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,940
thank you very much for letting
me tell my story to you. You

678
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,180

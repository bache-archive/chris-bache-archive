Sandy Sedgbeer: hello and
welcome joining me today to

15
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,800
share the 10 Best spiritual
books that inspired him the most

16
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,740
on his life journey is award
winning teacher and

17
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,280
international speaker
Christopher M Bache, whose

18
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,560
latest book LSD and the mind of
the universe is, in my opinion,

19
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,220
probably the most important book
of our time. Chris Bache is

20
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,980
professor emeritus in the
Department of Philosophy and

21
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,460
Religious Studies at Youngstown
State University, where he

22
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,000
taught for 33 years. He's a
fellow at the Institute of

23
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,840
Noetic Sciences and advisory
board member for Grof

24
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,540
Transpersonal training and the
Grof Foundation. And if you want

25
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,680
to know why I regard LSD and the
mind of the universe as the most

26
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,360
important book of this time,
stay tuned. We'll find out more

27
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
about that later in the show.
Meantime, Chris Bache, welcome

28
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,460
to the show.

29
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,340
Chris Bache: Thank you, Sandy.
It's a pleasure to be here with

30
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,580
you.

31
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,540
Sandy Sedgbeer: I'm always
intrigued to know. Books our

32
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,420
guests will choose, but I've
been especially keen to learn

33
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,840
and share with our audience your
timber spiritual books. When I

34
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,400
saw it, I saw the list, I said,
Well, that is one list, the only

35
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,360
one so far where all 10 books
have favorites of mine.

36
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,240
Chris Bache: Well, that's good
to hear straight. Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,820
Sandy Sedgbeer: So how did you
how did you find the process of

38
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,140
having to pick your Stan?

39
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,200
Chris Bache: It's kind of
interesting that there were so

40
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,860
many books to choose from, and
in the process of choosing the

41
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,640
ones that spoke most deeply to
me at any particular time in my

42
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,260
life, I found myself kind of
drawn to kind of more

43
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,960
intellectually oriented books,
because I'm an academic. And at

44
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,300
the end, I was quite struck by
how much I don't know. You know,

45
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,900
the books helped me so much, but
there's, there's so much that

46
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,960
I've left untouched in the
spiritual field. Wow.

47
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,700
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, I beg to
differ, and their audience will

48
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,480
find out later why I say that. I
mean, when you say there's so

49
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,820
much you need to know, I would
have thought, you know you know

50
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,980
what we all want to know, and
that's enough.

51
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,060
Chris Bache: It's not so much
what I need to know. It's just

52
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,880
stuff that I don't know. I feel
content with what I have learned

53
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,100
through my journey. Yeah,

54
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,040
Sandy Sedgbeer: but the Yeah,
well, the don't know bit, I

55
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,740
mean, you know, we can go on
forever there. So your first

56
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,640
book, understandably, is Stan is
left, Grof, realms of the human

57
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,340
unconscious realms, um,
observations from LSD research

58
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,300
published in 1975 you're a great
supporter of his work,

59
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,840
Chris Bache: aren't you? I am. I
think Stan's work is so

60
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,360
critically important to the
emerging paradigm in

61
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,340
Transpersonal psychology. And I
came upon this book right after

62
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,220
I was out of graduate school,
just beginning my teaching

63
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,840
career, just beginning to look
around for where to take my

64
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,700
research next. And I came upon
this first book by Stan that was

65
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,960
published just two years before.
And as soon as I read it, it

66
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,340
activated something in me, and I
knew I needed to get involved in

67
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,720
this process, even though
psychedelics were illegal at the

68
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,860
time, this was almost 10 years,
eight years after they had been

69
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,600
made illegal. I nevertheless,
decided to begin what became a

70
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,180
20 year journey, working with
LSD in a therapeutic protocol

71
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,080
that Stan lays out, working with
high dose sessions. Not not as a

72
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,960
clinician. I wasn't a
psychologist. I wasn't primarily

73
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,560
oriented towards healing. I'm a
philosopher of religion by

74
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,420
trade. I was interested in the
cosmic logical significance of

75
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,080
these substances, how they would
give us the head the potential

76
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,720
to show us new insights into the
deep structure of the universe,

77
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,220
and it that book just really
sort of lit the fuse for me.

78
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,140
Now, how old were you then? I
was 30 years old.

79
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, wow. And
that started your 20 year

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,220
journey.

81
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,339
Chris Bache: Yeah, between 30
and 50 that. That's really the

82
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,419
book that started it all for me.
And of course, I read all of

83
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,059
Stan's books as they came
through, and I always felt that

84
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:27,319
my books were largely first and
foremost in dialog with Stan's

85
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:27,859
work.

86
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,660
Sandy Sedgbeer: So book number
two, Ian Stevenson, 20 cases

87
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,960
suggestive of reincarnation,
published in 1966

88
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,780
Chris Bache: Yeah, I met this
book at the same time, I met

89
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:47,080
Stan's book, and at the time, I
was a deeply convinced agnostic

90
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,700
with strong atheistic leanings.
And I encountered this book by

91
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,160
Stevenson, which I think
presents overwhelming evidence,

92
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,480
the first of many books of his
that prevent present

93
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,600
overwhelming evidence that
reincarnation is simply a fact

94
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
of life. It's a natural fact of
life, which required that I

95
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,740
erase my entire intellectual
Blackboard, because

96
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,640
reincarnation had never been
taken seriously by any of the

97
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,120
courses that I had taken in
college or graduate school. I

98
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,740
had to erase the Blackboard and
start from scratch, which

99
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,820
resulted eventually, about 10
years later, in my publishing my

100
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,140
book on reincarnation life
cycles, which is my response to

101
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,360
Ian Stevenson's pioneering work.

102
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,280
Sandy Sedgbeer: So when you I'm
getting a bit of feedback now,

103
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,000
when you went down that path,
did you risk? You know the ire

104
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,160
of your colleagues. I

105
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,580
Chris Bache: did actually. I
went on sabbatical, my first

106
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,280
sabbatical, my head not planned
to write a book. I had not

107
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,580
planned to write this book, but
I came back with the book, the

108
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,600
Manuscript of the Book, and my
colleagues were not terribly

109
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,160
happy with it. I. But it got
published, and then it got

110
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,080
translated into several foreign
languages, and they began to pay

111
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,560
more attention to the subject
matter, so it didn't affect your

112
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,520
career. It didn't. I was afraid
that it might when I first did

113
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,600
it, but this is a kind of a
personal, karmic thing. I've

114
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,560
paid the penalty for going
against the grain in former

115
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,280
lives. This lifetime, it seems
that it's important for me to

116
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,560
continue to go against the grain
and not and not receive any

117
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,880
negative consequences, and only
receiving positive consequences.

118
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,179
Sandy Sedgbeer: Book number
three, journey of souls, case

119
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,379
studies of life between lives by
Michael Newton in 1994

120
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Chris Bache: Yeah, Michael
Newton's work is so beautiful

121
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,660
and so important. Started as a
past life therapist then

122
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,480
accidentally gave an ambiguous
instruction to a client, through

123
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,500
which he learned that we could
regress people, not only to

124
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,640
their former lives, but we could
regress people to the time in

125
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,260
between their death and their
subsequent rebirth. And he began

126
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:18,360
to give us a a not an
autobiographical people,

127
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,540
individual experiences of what
happened to them in their time

128
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,860
between their incarnations and
his series of books just were

129
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,400
fantastic about this. They had
not been published when I

130
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,780
published my book at first, but
they certainly do complement it

131
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,740
very beautifully.

132
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,020
Sandy Sedgbeer: I mean, he
really was a pioneer, there

133
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,280
wasn't he. I mean, so many
people I speak to trained with

134
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,180
Michael Newton,

135
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,560
Chris Bache: yeah, really was
and and his description of the

136
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,480
Bardo existence concurs with my
experience in psychedelics

137
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,700
completely with the provision
that I think he's he's seeing

138
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,340
more the lower half of the
Bardo, not the upper edges of

139
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,480
the Bardo. But yeah.

140
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,140
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, book
number four is lessons from the

141
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,380
light what we can learn from the
Near-Death Experience by Kenneth

142
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,540
ring, and that one was published
in 1998

143
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,580
Chris Bache: Yeah, I again,
which one of these books by each

144
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,380
of these authors we focus on?
Kenneth ring has always been a

145
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,300
colleague and friend. He wrote
the forward to life cycles. His

146
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,020
work on near death episodes was
so critically important. I

147
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,680
taught a course for many years
at the University called

148
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,820
Transpersonal studies in which
we always included near death

149
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,280
episode research. And I always
use Ken ring's books because

150
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,400
they were so accessible to the
students and so well researched.

151
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,260
And this book is kind of Ken's
last book on near death episode

152
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,100
research. It's an overview. It's
a compendium. It contains

153
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,780
beautiful passages all sorts of
empirical analysis. But my

154
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,280
favorite chapter in the book
comes towards the end where he's

155
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,120
describing the deepest near
death episodes that he has

156
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,260
recorded, and they are just
magnificent. Personally, as a

157
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:16,380
psychedelic oriented person, I
feel deepest compatibility or a

158
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,420
deepest resonance with people
who have had deep near death

159
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,840
episodes. Yeah.

160
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,600
Sandy Sedgbeer: So continuing
the theme Robert Monroe far

161
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,760
journey is his best selling
classic, published in 1985 Yeah.

162
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,119
Chris Bache: Robert Monroe has
been a real companion to me on

163
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:43,299
the journey through his works.
This book came out when I was on

164
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:49,119
my first sabbatical, and I was
writing life cycles. And I this

165
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,499
book came out, and I immediately
made a reservation to go and do

166
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,679
a week's training program at the
Monroe Institute, because I was

167
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,839
so impressed by his work. And
then I went back one more time

168
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,739
right after he passed, to go
back to the Monroe Institute for

169
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:09,119
a week's training to say
goodbye. Monroe, I think, is an

170
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:15,959
under studied figure in the
consciousness community. Maybe

171
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,779
it's because he's on the East
Coast and doesn't penetrate West

172
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,279
Coast circles so much, but the
model of the universe that he

173
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:27,139
presents, that emerged over
decades of his going out of his

174
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:31,819
body every every night, every
time he went to sleep, is just a

175
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:37,399
stunning model, idiosyncratic,
very candid. He Monroe just says

176
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,059
it. Calls it like he sees it.
But it's a very compatible model

177
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:47,259
with Eastern, particularly
Buddhist cosmology, the

178
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:52,479
structure of the Bardo, the long
the large model, I think, is

179
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:57,819
just a fantastic excursion, and
I've read it multiple times

180
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:58,059
through

181
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,660
Sandy Sedgbeer: the years. Did
you have many June. Awareness

182
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,080
when you

183
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,800
Chris Bache: were there. You
know, getting out of my body is

184
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,240
never an aptitude that I seem to
have developed. I when I was

185
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,500
there, I had definitely
Non-ordinary states of

186
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,280
consciousness, expansive,
diffuse and constant states of

187
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,720
consciousness where I was able
to make contact, for example,

188
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,980
with people who had died and
were in the Bardo, but they

189
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,460
weren't accompanied by the
sensation of being out of my

190
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,660
body. And this is true for all
my psychedelic work. I never had

191
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,560
the sensation of leaving my
body. Rather, my consciousness

192
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,020
expanded exponentially beyond
the limits of my body, but not

193
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,260
as kind of a separate
consciousness, individualized

194
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,000
consciousness, traveling out.

195
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,960
Sandy Sedgbeer: I always wanted
to go there. I never got there,

196
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,400
but I did attend a weekend
session by somebody who had

197
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,080
trained to do it and didn't
really work for me. Didn't I'm

198
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:05,640
so disappointed. Yeah, yeah.
Book number six by a man whose

199
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,500
work I love, Dwayne Aldous,
choosing Earth humanity's great

200
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,860
transition to a mature planetary
civilization. Published, I think

201
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,140
that was 2020 but there's been a
new edition published.

202
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,680
Chris Bache: Yes, he's updated
it, put it in a new edition.

203
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:31,040
Dwayne Elgin is a dear friend,
great colleague. Jokes. He's one

204
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,320
of my heroes. He's been trying
to raise the alarm about

205
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,240
humanity's Pearl and what we're
doing to the planet and the

206
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,480
limitations of our understanding
of the universe, the

207
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,500
consequences of buying into a
materialist paradigm instead of

208
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,560
a Living Universe paradigm. One
of his books The Living

209
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,540
Universe, from his first book on
voluntary simplicity, where he

210
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:01,020
points us where we need to be
going, reducing our impact on

211
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,480
the planet, living a simpler
life with more focus on what we

212
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,920
want to achieve with our life,
not a life of doing less, but a

213
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,360
life of doing more with less.
But this book, choosing Earth is

214
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,360
a distillation of decades and
decades of his thinking on the

215
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,600
earth. He lays out a very
carefully, scientifically

216
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,920
informed proposal for what the
next 50 years are going to look

217
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,140
like, decade by decade, and then
he follows this with a series of

218
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,360
recommendations for how we can
consciously and intelligently

219
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,540
engage this crisis and work to
ensure a better outcome. It's

220
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,920
just, it's a beautiful book, and
his wife, Colleen has produced a

221
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,360
film that is the companion to
the book. So you and they're

222
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,500
giving away the book and giving
away the film for free. It is.

223
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,020
Dwayne says it's too important.
We are right now. Things are too

224
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,580
important to try to make money

225
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,720
Sandy Sedgbeer: out of this
pearl. Do you know where people

226
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,840
can go to find the movie and
what's it called?

227
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,580
Chris Bache: It's called, oh my
goodness, I'm having a senior

228
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,540
moment. Here you can go to
Dwayne Elgin's website. Dwayne

229
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,760
elgin.com and his books are
listed there, and the movie is

230
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,560
there. His wife's name is
Colleen ladru Elgin. Yeah.

231
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,380
Sandy Sedgbeer: I'll check it
out. Yeah. Number seven, another

232
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,940
author whose work I admire
tremendously, Rupert Sheldrake,

233
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,020
a new science of life, the
hypothesis of Morphic resonance,

234
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,400
published in 1981

235
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,260
Chris Bache: against a person
has written such an extra

236
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:50,020
ordinary series of books when I
was trying to understand, as I

237
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,480
say in my notes here, when I was
trying to understand why my

238
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,140
psychedelic purification healing
experiences had expanded so

239
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,800
exponentially to include
hundreds of 1000s of human

240
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,060
beings, the whole breadth of the
human species, and later, when I

241
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,140
was trying to understand some of
the dynamics that were being

242
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,160
that were showing up in my
classroom, that seemed this

243
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,500
permeability between my mind And
my students mind. Rupert

244
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
sheldrake's work was really
helpful to me, and very

245
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,900
important because he helped me
understand that our individual

246
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,060
minds of every being is always
also simultaneously network into

247
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,740
a species mind, so that as the
species learns, the individual

248
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,820
learns, as the individual
learns, the species learns, and

249
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,620
a complex feedback dynamic, and
this was extraordinarily helpful

250
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,980
when I it helped me make the
transition of thinking about

251
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,760
what was happening in my
sessions in terms of a personal

252
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,900
model of transformation into a
collective model of

253
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,540
transformation. And this became
the primary theme of my second

254
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,380
book, Dark Night early dawn,
where I'm really talking about

255
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,980
the collective that the dark
night of our collective soul,

256
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,480
the transformation of our
collective soul. And that has

257
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,880
Rupert's fingerprints all over
it.

258
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,520
Sandy Sedgbeer: He took a lot of
flack, didn't he? He really has,

259
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,140
you know, had to fight the good
fight there. And yet, he's said

260
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,160
to me that some of the people
who publicly deny his work

261
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,480
privately,

262
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,760
Chris Bache: yeah, too often in
academia, we have our public

263
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,320
reputations and our private
convictions that don't match our

264
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,480
public positions.

265
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,320
Sandy Sedgbeer: Sad, isn't it?
Yeah, people don't feel that

266
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,540
they can be authentic and say
what they think.

267
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,440
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah. And
Rupert's been just a real hero

268
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,600
in challenging the status quo,
in scientific thought and just

269
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,400
pushing and pushing and pushing
the issues on the table that he

270
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,120
believes in,

271
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,500
Sandy Sedgbeer: yeah, yeah. So
book number eight Richard

272
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,120
Tarnas, cosmic and psyche,
intimations of a new world view,

273
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,480
published in 1996 Yeah.

274
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:19,439
Chris Bache: Rick Tarnas is
another colleague and dear

275
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:24,739
friend, an extra ordinary
astrologer. After establishing

276
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:28,759
his professional reputation as
an historian of intellectual

277
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:33,319
thought with his book passion of
the Western mind, he then came

278
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,719
up with this book, Cosmos and
psyche, in which he makes the

279
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:43,239
case that astrology not only
illumines the lives of

280
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:46,659
individuals, and he demonstrates
this very powerfully in the book

281
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:51,399
with known historical figures,
but that Astrology can be used

282
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:56,499
to illumine historical epics.
And it's so, it's that is the

283
00:21:56,499 --> 00:22:00,239
larger thesis which is so
particularly provocative is his

284
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:04,739
analysis of history in terms of
the rhythms of the of the

285
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,819
archetypal astrological pulses
of our solar system, and showing

286
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:14,819
a correlation between the
quality of the archetypal

287
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:17,879
energies that are being brought
into focus from an archetype

288
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:21,619
from an astrological lens to
looking at what's actually

289
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:26,059
happening at an historical level
and showing the correlations.

290
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:29,239
And I think it's an
extraordinarily important and

291
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:33,499
very valuable book, also a real
tour de force. You have to strap

292
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,899
in when you read one of Rick's

293
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,680
Sandy Sedgbeer: books. Yeah,
yeah. I'm sure I was looking at

294
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,580
looking it up earlier, and I
think it was contents list one,

295
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,960
one of the things on there that
caught my eye, because it really

296
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,120
relates so much to your work and
what's in your book, the

297
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,620
transformation of the cosmos,
the birth of the modern self,

298
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,820
and the dawn of A new universe,
which is pretty much where we

299
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,440
are now, the birth of the modern
self. I mean, you talk about the

300
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,600
future human in your book. What
is, what is the modern self?

301
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,980
Chris Bache: I think the modern
self is a birth that was given,

302
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,620
is the self sense that was given
birth to in the Age of

303
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,400
Enlightenment, and it's the
rational self, it's that gives

304
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,440
birth to science, the scientific
self. And I think what we're

305
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,240
seeing is now that the modern
self is thoroughly and deeply

306
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,220
established. The modern self is
someone who, like Martin Luther

307
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,980
can pound his 96 thesis on the
door of the cathedral and

308
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,780
basically say to this multi 100
year old religious tradition of

309
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,740
the Roman Catholicism, you're
wrong and you're wrong on this,

310
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,000
this and this, that self
consolidated within ourselves so

311
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,860
that we can become critical,
Turn a critical lens on our

312
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,820
history and our culture and our
context, that self, now

313
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,840
thoroughly established in
history, is yielding to a post

314
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,680
modern self, I think, and that's
the future human that so many of

315
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,360
us are feeling, intuiting and
experiencing in our

316
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,660
contemplative practices. The
post modern self doesn't negate

317
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,620
the modern self, but it
reconnects the modern self to

318
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,300
the underlying, deeper fabric of
consciousness that runs through

319
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,080
all things, not only through all
human beings, but through all of

320
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,380
life. So the modern self is
being recontextualized within

321
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:47,200
the larger fabric of existence.
And that is, I think, the future

322
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,680
human, the and the way I
understand that the technical

323
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,400
parts of that is in terms of the
birth of the diamond soul.

324
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,240
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, we will
talk more about that after the

325
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,460
break. So book number nine.
Nine, Sri Aurobindo, or the

326
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,540
adventure of consciousness by
sat Prem, published in 1968

327
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,000
Chris Bache: Sri Aurobindo is
one of my heroes. He's just such

328
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,840
a brilliant man, Oxford,
educated and Hindu saint and

329
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,580
Guru transition from being a
political activist to being a

330
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,280
Spiritual Activist. And he more
or less channeled all his books.

331
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,100
I mean, apparently all of his
books were written within six

332
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,540
years. He just channeled them.
But they're very dense. They're,

333
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,720
you know, you really have to sit
down with a cup of coffee if

334
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,180
you're going to read Aurobindo,
because he's so rich. Sat RAM is

335
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,220
a has written a biography which
basically extracts the core

336
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,900
insights that that Aurobindo
presented in his writing, but he

337
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,020
does it in a way which makes
them more accessible to the

338
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,340
average reader like me and I
just I really appreciate it

339
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,740
saprem Because he gives me a
back door way into aurobindo's

340
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,680
thought, and he it makes it
easier for me when I want to

341
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,800
tangle the tackle. The primary
text

342
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,240
Sandy Sedgbeer: we had a guest
on a few months ago who

343
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,600
recommended, I don't know if it
was this book, but one of his,

344
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,880
and was talking about how he and
the mother, I believe it was

345
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,860
during the war they would
meditate, and they would

346
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:33,320
basically send thoughts, yeah,
you know, to Hitler, good

347
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,820
thoughts. And they would see and
and they'd send thoughts to

348
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,580
Churchill as well. And they
basically sent one particular

349
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,480
thought to Churchill about how
he would mobilize, you know, the

350
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,040
British spirit, you know, to
back him completely. And in

351
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,440
fact, what he then said in his
next speech was almost word for

352
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,660
word. They had transmitted,
yeah, yeah.

353
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,440
Chris Bache: They just, they
live in the truth of the open

354
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,580
expanse of mind, and that our
individual thoughts and minds,

355
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,040
when focus, can travel into the
ocean of consciousness and reach

356
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,720
your intended destination.

357
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,500
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yes, yeah, it
made me, you know, I've got to

358
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,860
put him on my reading list. The
last book is the flight of the

359
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:30,500
Garuda teachings of the Dzogchen
tradition of Tibetan Buddhism,

360
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,480
by Keith Dow and published in
1994

361
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,360
Chris Bache: Well, Vadnais
Buddhism has been a large

362
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,040
influence on me, and the
question the challenge I had

363
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,400
was, which of the many books
that have moved me so deeply in

364
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:51,220
Buddhism, could I put here? One
that I considered almost put so

365
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,500
I just want to mention is the
book graceful exits, which is a

366
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,060
story of how great beings,
enlightened beings, die. It's a

367
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,800
collection by, oh, I'm blanking
on her name of just the death

368
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,300
experiences of enlightened
beings. But I chose, in the end,

369
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,840
one of my favorite tantric
texts, the flight of the Garuda,

370
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,300
which basically was a bit
controversial when it was first

371
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,140
published, because many
traditional Vadnais

372
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,920
practitioners did not believe
that he should have made public

373
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,220
such an esoteric text as this.
Personally, I love it when I

374
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,440
read tantric texts like this.
I'm always bringing to it all of

375
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,080
my background in psychedelic
experience. And when I read this

376
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,840
text, and as his commentary, I
just feel illumined. I feel so

377
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,440
at home with it, and I learned
so much from it that helps me

378
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,180
process my own psychedelic
experiences. Dzogchen is

379
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,540
considered the fastest path, the
direct path in Vadnais,

380
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,920
Buddhism. It's a form of
Buddhist practice which more or

381
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,640
less kind of starts at the end,
instead of kind of developing

382
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,420
stage by stage, stage by stage,
up the mountain. It kind of

383
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,060
draws upon the insight that
where we end up at the end of

384
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,040
our spiritual practice, our end
of our journey in enlightenment

385
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,840
is in a condition which always
existed from the very beginning.

386
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,960
It's not something which is
brought into being, but it is

387
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,040
always there, never changes,
never ceases to exist, never

388
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,000
begins to exist. Once you know
that, then you can build your

389
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,100
spiritual practice around the
fact of this pre existing

390
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,420
condition, the direct path, and
that's what this book is coming

391
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:46,960
out of.

392
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,520
Sandy Sedgbeer: Of those 10
books, do you have a favorite?

393
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:58,540
Chris Bache: Oh, I have so many.
I guess I'm I've lived my life

394
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,420
around the first two I.
Stevenson and Stan Grof, just

395
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,720
because I believe that
reincarnation is an absolutely

396
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,800
essential understanding to life,
and psychedelics have been the

397
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,620
way for me to personally explore
the deep structure of the

398
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,600
universe. So I guess I'd have to
say those. But all of them are

399
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,440
favorites of mine. They're all
on my must read list.

400
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,920
Sandy Sedgbeer: Well, some of
these people you know, of those

401
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,680
that you don't know. Who would
you most like to meet

402
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:34,760
Chris Bache: those I don't know?
Well, I would love to have met

403
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,800
Michael Newton, yeah, he's now
passed on, so I'll be looking

404
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,820
him up when I die, that's for
sure, because he's he

405
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,020
contributed so much to my life.
Yeah, I

406
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,820
Sandy Sedgbeer: bet you're not
the only one who'll be looking

407
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,180
him up.

408
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,320
Chris Bache: Yes, you know,
Marjorie Monroe says we can go

409
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,680
anywhere and find anyone that we
want when we die, all we have to

410
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:05,820
do is know their know their ID,
you know. And so we can, we can

411
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,200
check up on people

412
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,640
Sandy Sedgbeer: that'll keep us
busy until we come back again, I

413
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,420
guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well,
that's your 10 Best list, but

414
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,620
it's by no means the whole of
this show. We're going to take a

Sandy Sedgbeer: Christ, welcome
back. Christopher Bache, in 1979

459
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,640
you embarked on a life changing
journey, you said, to explore

460
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,120
your mind and the mind of the
universe as deeply and as

461
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,680
systematically as possible, with
the help of LSD, and over the

462
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:45,880
next 20 years, you experienced
73 high dose sessions following

463
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Stan grofs protocols, those
journeys which were intensely

464
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,740
grueling and also equally
blissful, took you Beyond The

465
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:01,320
Beyond took you to a place I
would love to go. Into a unified

466
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,960
field of consciousness that
underlies all physical

467
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,240
existence. So many questions, so
many questions. We won't have

468
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,100
time for all of them. But why
don't you tell us what is the

469
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,480
most important thing that you
think we need to know that you

470
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,980
learned on those journeys? Well?

471
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,640
Chris Bache: Oh, that's a hard
question. First thing it pops in

472
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,880
my mind is, don't do what I did.
I wouldn't do it the same way if

473
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,960
I did it over again, but getting
I would be much gentler on

474
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,080
myself. And that's partly one of
the things I learned was, I

475
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,560
thought the purpose of this work
was kind of get to an end state,

476
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,340
that there was an end state that
would change my life, transform

477
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,140
my life. And what I learned
along the way, and I was 17

478
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,100
years into this journey at this
point, is that it's an infinite

479
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,440
progression. It's an infinite
universe. You'll never get to

480
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,360
the end of it. And so the whole
project of pushing as hard as I

481
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,900
did with the thought that I
could get to the end of it was

482
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,540
just it was a mistaken concept
that I brought to it. You know,

483
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,320
what happens in a psychedelic
state is an amplification of

484
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,900
what's taking place in life, in
ordinary processes. So in order

485
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,080
to understand what happens in a
psychedelic state, you have to

486
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,100
know what's life. It's what's
happening in ordinary life. And

487
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,240
here, I think we have to come
understand reincarnation. We

488
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,560
have to understand that this is
the rhythm of life, that we are

489
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,300
cosmic being, that we are a
being that lives in time frames

490
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,920
of hundreds of 1000s, millions
of years, that this particular

491
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,600
incarnation is only one of many
incarnations on this planet. In

492
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:01,200
order to understand what life is
about, we have to look out in

493
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,760
terms of the one short term, 100
year old lifespan. We have to

494
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,080
think in terms of the soul's
lifespan, which is vast. So

495
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,320
that's, that's the first thing
is an underscoring and

496
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:21,020
reinforcing of reincarnation,
also just the encounter with the

497
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:25,220
living intelligence, which is, I
call it the mind of the

498
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,920
universe, because our concepts
of the Divine and God have so

499
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,400
many cultural limitations built
into them through history. I

500
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,240
don't want to affirm those,
though I do sometimes speak of

501
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,280
the Divine less often, but I'll
talk about God, but the

502
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,060
consciousness, which one can
encounter, which one can

503
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,680
dissolve into the intelligence,
the genius. I mean, just to

504
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,480
experience briefly, the
intelligence of of the mind

505
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,860
that's generating the universe
and the compassion and love and

506
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:05,160
wisdom. And you know, when you
just look at life, it looks

507
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,760
hard. I mean, it is hard and it
looks like it could have been

508
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:15,120
created by a despot, because it
is so seemingly cruel. But in

509
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,680
order to understand the genius
of it and the wisdom of it and

510
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,120
the compassion of it, you have
to be able to step back and look

511
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,840
very deep. It's like stepping
back off of the planet to

512
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,040
understand what's happening on
the planet. And in that context,

513
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,760
we experience, you can
experience the universe as this

514
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,840
magnificent garden that has been
created specifically for our

515
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,340
transformation, our share of it,
our transformation, and we have

516
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,900
unlimited amount of time to
continue to learn and grow in

517
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,340
this garden. And it's a it's not
an easy garden. It's a hard

518
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,440
place to live and grow, but it
offers us infinite potential to

519
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,620
develop the essential being that
we are, and our essential being

520
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,640
is the divine being, our light
of the Divine. We come from the

521
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,300
Divine. We are a spark of the
divine light. And yet we're

522
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,680
small and kind of immature in
the early stages, but we develop

523
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,320
it and develop it and develop it
until eventually we can become a

524
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:27,140
being that has complete control
over their incarnation, complete

525
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,280
control over the health of their
body, complete control over the

526
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,820
wealth of their mind and
creativity. And we're growing

527
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,140
and growing and growing in this
direction, toward that

528
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,720
direction. And I guess one of
the other major takeaways is an

529
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:49,120
understanding of where we are in
history, where humanity is and

530
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,800
here so many visionary
experiences that humanity is

531
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,800
coming to a turning point.
Humanity is coming to a

532
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,200
bifurcation point, a radical
deconstruction. And followed by

533
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,900
a reconstruction at a higher
organizational level. I think we

534
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,700
are entering, after hundreds of
1000s years of reincarnation,

535
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,540
where we have been gestating the
future human lifetime by

536
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,720
lifetime by lifetime, gestating
the future humans form we are

537
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,040
now have entered the period of
labor, and the day of labor is a

538
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:32,480
very intense, very dangerous
time, very painful time. But

539
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,800
when it's over, the mother gives
birth to a new child, and I

540
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,960
think humanity is in the process
of giving birth to a new child

541
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,500
to the latest iteration of its
own fundamental form. I think

542
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:53,080
we're we're witnessing in this
century and the next, a shift in

543
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,880
the in the collective psyche, a
shift in the fundamental

544
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,640
architecture of the collective
unconscious, so that all future

545
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,440
human beings who are born after
we make this transition will be

546
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,880
living in the context of a
different fundamentally

547
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,560
structured psyche. This is what
I call the birth the diamond

548
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,380
soul. I think that after all
these years of incarnating, we

549
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,920
are reaching a period in history
where these lives are coming

550
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,080
together inside us, and as they
come together, we first have to

551
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,720
purify and heal all their broken
and hurt pieces. But as we do

552
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,140
that, they move into deeper and
deeper, either gradually or

553
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:45,460
suddenly, there is an ignition
that takes place and the soul is

554
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,600
born. And that is, the soul is
the intelligence that holds all

555
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,440
of our experiences through all
of our incarnations. And that, I

556
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,540
think, is the emerging future
human in history. The soul is

557
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:05,160
being born inside history. So
how can I pick and choose which

558
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,320
of those concepts are the most
important?

559
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,100
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, I know
well you, you said in the book

560
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,520
that there are many, many layers
to heaven and to the death

561
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,560
experience, and that there is no
hell, but there is confrontation

562
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,940
and accountability. Is that what
many people you know regard as

563
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:32,900
the life review, yeah, karma,
yeah. More about that.

564
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:38,779
Chris Bache: You know, our
understandings of the God and

565
00:42:38,779 --> 00:42:43,179
our understandings of life have
been so primitive historically.

566
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:48,159
I mean, we, we're, we only began
to make contact, experiential

567
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,959
contact, with the core,
essential nature of our being,

568
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:57,099
the divine nature of our being,
about five or 6000 years ago as

569
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:02,939
a species, and we're just
getting started, and so many of

570
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:08,999
our concepts of God and
punishment and reward and Heaven

571
00:43:08,999 --> 00:43:15,359
Hell, I think, are just just
completely inadequate to really

572
00:43:15,419 --> 00:43:20,599
understand the true scale and
scope of the intention of

573
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:30,259
creation when we die, when we
die, in the life review, we

574
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:34,579
encounter not only a detailed
remembering of everything we've

575
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:38,239
ever done in this lifetime, but
we also experience how it

576
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,979
impacted, how it touched the
lives of those around us, both

577
00:43:41,979 --> 00:43:46,659
directly and indirectly, touches
their lives, and to the extent

578
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:50,739
that we have made bad choices,
then that comes back to us in

579
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:54,939
the experience of hell, and to
the extent that we've made good

580
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:59,079
choices, that comes back to us
in the experience of heaven. But

581
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:04,019
in the end, the goal of this
whole system is not to punish us

582
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,219
or reward us in some cheap way,
but to educate us, to teach us

583
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:11,459
so that we can learn, so we
learn from our mistakes, and we

584
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:14,579
learn from other things we've
done well. And we keep on

585
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:19,859
growing. We keep on moving
through the idea that Infinite

586
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,819
Intelligence and infinite
compassion could produce

587
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:27,499
something like the eternal
damnation that hell envisions is

588
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:33,379
just ridiculous. It just it's
done so much damage, I think, to

589
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,619
human beings through history,
and it's just wrong.

590
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,320
Sandy Sedgbeer: You know, it's
the experiences you've had. And

591
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,660
the concept of the Infinite is a
very hard concept. You know, to

592
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,720
think that you could go on
journeying and journeying and

593
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,060
journeying and reincarnation and
reincarnation. You know, the

594
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:02,340
mind has to get to a point where
it's. Says enough, you know, I

595
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:08,940
don't want to do this anymore.
It's, it's endless, yeah. How do

596
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,840
you feel about

597
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:15,120
Chris Bache: that? I think when
we die, we go home. I mean, we

598
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,020
return to spirit, and we return
to our soul, the larger and

599
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,960
consciousness, and we read, we
are brought back into peace.

600
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,260
We're brought back into
wholeness, and we're brought

601
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,720
back home. Now the trick is
there are many, many levels of

602
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,980
home, and so you can experience
homecoming in the spiritual

603
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,320
world at an introductory level,
an intermediate level and a very

604
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,820
advanced level. There are many
levels of joy. So I think there

605
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:52,840
is a sense in which we get to
stop and pause and rest and

606
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,520
refresh ourselves after every
incarnation. Now there are

607
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,320
sometimes some people die under
such traumatic circumstances

608
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,440
that can get thrown off in
different ways, but for the most

609
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,920
part, most people return home
without any difficulties. When

610
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,720
we are there, we are restored,
we are reconnected with the

611
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:21,560
divine, and it's in that context
where we make the choice of

612
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,580
first, whether to incarnate
again, and where to reincarnate

613
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,300
again, and ask what to
reincarnate again. So what

614
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,200
sounds and so I think it's
natural as we go through life,

615
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,000
if, if we live our life well,
we're tired at the end, we don't

616
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,260
the idea of living multiple
times it's like that's

617
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,520
exhausting. We're already tired,
but from the soul's perspective,

618
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,460
it's from the period, from the
perspective of having been

619
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:53,860
refreshed and rejuvenated, that
we voluntarily choose another

620
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:58,480
course of instruction to deepen
ourselves as a human being and

621
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,920
to help other human beings,
because eventually it becomes

622
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,420
clear we're not in this alone.
We're all in this together, and

623
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,780
it's the most natural thing in
the world to want to help other

624
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,660
human beings in their own
evolutionary journey.

625
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,160
Sandy Sedgbeer: When you say
that there are so many different

626
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:23,180
levels, that makes a lot of
sense to me. So many people

627
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,600
write about the afterlife have
messages from the afterlife.

628
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,140
Hear about, you know, how the
loved ones are living in the

629
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,340
afterlife or existing, and
they're all so contradictory.

630
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,200
But if there are many levels,
you know, then that really does

631
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,760
explain a lot. But the other
thing I want to talk about is

632
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,740
you talked earlier about
transformation. You know, we are

633
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,420
on a journey of transformation,
and we are the sparks. And it

634
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,140
makes me think then that we must
be very young sparks if we need

635
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:02,640
to keep on being refined and
transformed. I mean, do older

636
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,900
sparks not come back?

637
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:12,600
Chris Bache: Good question, good
question. And again, to even

638
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,380
begin to address that question,
we have to push back the walls

639
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,860
of our assumptions. We have to
really begin to think deeper and

640
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:27,560
longer and larger. The spiritual
traditions that believe in

641
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:34,400
reincarnation say reincarnation
is obligatory up to a certain

642
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,480
point in our developmental
process. So we may drag our

643
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,200
feet, we may take time, but
sooner or later we have to come

644
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,460
back to the reincarnation
process, but there comes a time

645
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,160
when you no longer have to. Now,
the early Eastern tradition said

646
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,180
that's the that's the critical
moment when you can leave, and

647
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,820
everybody wants to leave, and
that's what the religions are

648
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,140
all about, moksha, escape,
getting to the Pure Land,

649
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,380
getting to heaven. I don't think
that's really what it's all

650
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,740
about, I think, but it is a
significant turning point,

651
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,260
because once we no longer have
to participate in the

652
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:19,140
reincarnation cycle, once it's
purely an it's purely optional,

653
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:24,740
then we can choose to
participate freely, and more

654
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:30,440
strategically, to support, not
necessarily our own individual

655
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,460
development, maybe, but not
necessarily, but to be able to

656
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,420
support the development of other
human beings. You might think of

657
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,920
them as our grandchildren, our
great grandchildren, in the end,

658
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,860
from a deep, spiritual
perspective, they're all our

659
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,580
children. They're all our
grandchildren. All of humanity

660
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,660
is now. There are some beings, I
think, who have reached that

661
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:56,380
point, and they've gone on to
explore other dimensions of

662
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:02,100
existence, the physical
universe. Universe is only one

663
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:09,420
dimension of a multi dimensional
cosmos in spiritual reality. So

664
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:15,240
as vast as the physical universe
is, it seems to be only one

665
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:21,740
universe out of a multi universe
system. So in order to sort of

666
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:27,320
ask, Are there no Are there no
old souls here? Or where do old

667
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,820
sparks of light go? That just
takes us really deep into the

668
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,360
vast expanse of things. You
know, when the Buddha was asked

669
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,140
this question, he didn't, he
refused to answer it. He about,

670
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:44,020
where does an enlightened being
go, he said that however he

671
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,220
answered it, it would confuse
the listener, and it was better

672
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,960
to just work on your own
transformation, until you can

673
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,400
have the experience of awakening
yourself, and then you'll know

674
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,440
for your own truth where we're
going when We die, and what's

675
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,040
available to us when we die.
Because if you say the awakened

676
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,520
one does not exist as they die,
then that leads to a mistake. If

677
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,180
you say that the awakened one
does exist when they die, that

678
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,720
also leads to a mistake, because
the conditions are so different

679
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,760
than that either or recognizes

680
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,280
Sandy Sedgbeer: you talked about
this incredible intelligent

681
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,960
consciousness, this, I'll call
it a divine being, because I

682
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,860
don't know how else to describe
it. But of course, calling it a

683
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:43,540
being minimizes it. It's
infinite. Is this something that

684
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,940
we all can experience? Oh

685
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:51,520
Chris Bache: yes, absolutely,
because its nature is our

686
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,280
nature. And so when we
experience the deepest aspect of

687
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,160
our own being, we experience its
being. We experience its nature.

688
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,360
It's impossible to step out of
this being. This being, the body

689
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,620
of this being, is the body of
the universe. All the vast

690
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:14,760
expanse of spiritual reality is
the consciousness of the

691
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,120
universe, the non physical
aspect of this, of this being.

692
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,640
And again, like you, I hesitate
to call it a being, because that

693
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,280
gives it kind of a boundary
quality, and there are no

694
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,640
boundaries, yeah, but yeah, this
is not only can we experience

695
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,960
it, but it is our destiny to
experience it. And I think when

696
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,920
we die, we return to the
remembrance of this nature, and

697
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,660
that's why we want to incarnate
again, in order to deepen our

698
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:51,820
experience of our essential
nature. It's kind of like when

699
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,440
we die, our cup is filled to the
brim. But you can have a half a

700
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,900
cup, three quarters of a cup,
full cup, or two cups, you know,

701
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,900
and we want a bigger and bigger
cup so we can experience more

702
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,240
and more of the divine bliss.

703
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,180
Sandy Sedgbeer: You You said in
the book how painful it was. It

704
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,920
became painful to leave the
presence of that being, and

705
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,160
that's ultimately one of the
reasons why you stopped having

706
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,740
the sessions. Have you found
other ways to experience it that

707
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,880
aren't so painful

708
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,440
Chris Bache: the full intensity
of communion with light of

709
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,600
existence? No, I have not found
other ways of experiencing it in

710
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:45,220
its full intensity. I have
committed myself to grabbing

711
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,760
physical existence, my physical
existence, and not letting it

712
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:54,520
go, and learning to love the
manifest body of the divine in

713
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,640
that I see around me, in every
person and in the stars at

714
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:03,000
night, I am comfortable in this
world. I love this world, and I

715
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,220
do my spiritual practice and you
know, but in terms of getting

716
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:15,360
access to those same dimensions
of diamond Luminosity, no, I've

717
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,020
had to let go of that for the
time being. That said, I know

718
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,400
there are beings who do you
know? I know there are great

719
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,900
spiritual beings, truly the, you
know, the mahasiddhas, the great

720
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,920
beings, who are able to live in
conscious communion with those

721
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,580
subtle planes of existence. I
don't happen to be one of those

722
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:40,840
beings yet. So it's still hope.
I think if I practice every day

723
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,320
for the rest of my life. In this
incarnation, I still not would

724
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,580
not be able to realize, in my
particular case, in traditional

725
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:52,720
contemplative practice, the
levels of reality that I access,

726
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,520
what that I was accessing after
20 years of work in this

727
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,260
particular form of practice.
With psychedelics,

728
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,220
Sandy Sedgbeer: but knowing what
you know, knowing what it feels

729
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,700
like, knowing you know where
you've been and what you've

730
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,840
experienced, it must make life a
little bit hard. You know,

731
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,520
knowing that that is always
there,

732
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,020
Chris Bache: it makes it hard
and it makes it easier. It makes

733
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,420
it easier, because now I know. I
know it in my heart and in my

734
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:27,800
bones that we are always
surrounded and suffused with

735
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,920
this divine intelligence and
love, and one can draw on it

736
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,640
continuously, so that, in that
sense, it makes it easier,

737
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,360
because the greatest burden I
think of physical existence is

738
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:43,420
not knowing. And we're we get
driven crazy by not knowing, and

739
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,080
that burden has been lifted from
me, but it does make it hard in

740
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,920
the sense that to once you. And
this is nothing unique to

741
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,280
psychedelic journey. People who
have deep, n des near death

742
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,600
experiences, same thing they
they have to. It's a challenge

743
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,340
to come back into time and space
and be content with living here

744
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,240
and that aspect, it is harder
because you know that it's

745
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,500
there, and you know that it's
only your own silliness which is

746
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,860
keeping you from enjoying it
fully right here, right now.

747
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,120
It's only my own imperfections
which are keeping me out of that

748
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,800
state right here, right now.

749
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:28,699
Sandy Sedgbeer: This 200 100 200
years of transformation that we

750
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:32,539
are going to go through. Yeah,
it's, it's a wonderful thing,

751
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:36,139
and it gives a lot of people a
lot of hope. And goodness knows,

752
00:56:36,499 --> 00:56:39,019
you know, we're all aware of
what's happening in the world

753
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:42,939
today and how challenging that
is to live with, and many people

754
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:47,979
are very afraid. But when we're
in a human form, if we haven't

755
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:52,119
had the experiences that you've
had, it's also very hard to

756
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:56,739
think I'm not going to see it in
my lifetime. I've got to wait a

757
00:56:56,739 --> 00:57:01,259
couple of 100 years that it just
sounds too much.

758
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:07,919
Chris Bache: You know, the
timetable was not given to me,

759
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:12,539
and the details of the
transformation were not given to

760
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:16,199
me in my visionary experiences,
what I was given was the

761
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:22,159
experience of the human species
undergoing the pain of a deep

762
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:28,039
and profound global collapse and
this and the beauty and this

763
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:31,579
first and the certainty that we
would make it through, and a lot

764
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:34,159
of people are beginning to think
that we're not going to make it

765
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,339
through. It's an extinction
event. My visionary experience

766
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:41,499
is that we do make it through,
and we are profoundly changed in

767
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:47,139
this process. You know, it's
kind of like, you know, when a

768
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:50,379
woman starts labor in the
morning, when she's starting

769
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:53,439
labor, she might think, Oh, I
don't want to do this today.

770
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:56,199
Let's do something else. But
there's no choice. We're in it,

771
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,439
and I think that's what's going
to happen to us. Now, we may not

772
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:03,599
want to be in it, but we're in
it, and the key to navigating it

773
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,759
well is to do it well. Each of
us has a small share in this

774
00:58:08,759 --> 00:58:13,679
collective transformation, and
the actions of individuals have

775
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,599
disproportionately arch large
outcomes in a time of intense

776
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:22,519
and accelerated change and non
linear systems, so that each one

777
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:28,339
of us can have a positive impact
on a good outcome of this crisis

778
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:31,219
that we're going through. And I
don't know how long it's going

779
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:35,599
to take us, but this is the work
of the hour. This is what we are

780
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:37,099
all here working toward.

781
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,480
Sandy Sedgbeer: Yeah, and it's
not as though we're not going to

782
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,840
experience that transformation.
Because if we keep coming back,

783
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,080
we're definitely going to be a
part of it.

784
00:58:47,259 --> 00:58:50,619
Chris Bache: Yeah, and I think
the joy when we begin to

785
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:53,739
experience in between our
lifetimes and on earth,

786
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:58,479
eventually, when we experience
this new human being that is

787
00:58:58,479 --> 00:59:02,879
coming forward in history and we
aren't, you know, nature, or the

788
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:06,539
force behind nature, is giving
birth to this being. When we

789
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:12,899
experience this being as just
like experience a newborn babe,

790

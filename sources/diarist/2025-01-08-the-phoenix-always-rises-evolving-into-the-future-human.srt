00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,920
Manda Scott: Chris, welcome to
the accidental goals podcast.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,300
How are you and where are you?
This slightly gray December day

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,220
over here, but it might be
lovely where you are.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,700
Chris Bache: Hi, Amanda. It's
pleasure to be here with you.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm speaking to you from
Weaverville, North Carolina,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,040
which is just outside of
Asheville, North Carolina, and

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,160
it's a sunny day here. It's
going to be in a lovely

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,680
afternoon in the mid 40s. Wow.

9
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,099
Manda Scott: Okay, now I have
weather envy, but, but hey,

10
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:36,679
you're in a swing state, which
at some point we might get onto.

11
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,679
That must have been quite
entertaining for a brief period

12
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,779
of time. Let's not go there.
That's two pages. All right. So

13
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:48,099
you've written a number of
books, you've had a very

14
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:51,819
inspiring life, and my
projection onto you, which I am

15
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:54,159
almost certain is not true, is
that you have the answers to

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,079
life, the universe and
everything. So we'll lay that

17
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,659
one to bed as it's my
projection, and you don't see it

18
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:03,959
that way, just so it's clear
we're there. And from where you

19
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:08,519
are, what is most alive for you
at this inflection point of

20
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:09,419
humanity?

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,160
Chris Bache: Well, we've just
gone through an election in our

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,180
country, which was for the
liberal side of the continent

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,920
like me, was very disappointing
and very upsetting what's

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,000
happening in politics, in my
country and in many countries

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,480
around the world, this whole
movement to the conservative

26
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,620
right is very much of concern,
especially since they are

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,460
denying fundamental facts that
are clearly critically important

28
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,700
for humanity To address. First
and foremost is the fact of

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:51,820
global climate change. And yeah,
so that's happening. And in my

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,180
book, LSD, in the mind of the
universe, I have a whole chapter

31
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,260
on what I call the birth of the
future human, which summarizes

32
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,780
all the transmissions that were
given to me over a 20 year

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,060
course of high dose LSD sessions
about humanity's future, where

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,220
we are in our evolutionary
development, the critical crisis

35
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,380
that we are moving into, the
birth of of a new form of

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,580
humanity coming out of that
crisis. So when I and a great

37
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,800
future for humanity, but for
deep, spiritualized realization

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,120
to emerge in humanity, there
must take place, first, a dark

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
night of the soul, a collective
dark night of the soul. So I see

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,980
what's happening politically
against that backdrop of a

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,360
growing dismantling of
assumptions, a growing

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,460
unraveling of our social
contracts, and a growing global

43
00:02:54,460 --> 00:03:00,040
crisis, which seems to be
generated by seems to be

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,360
generating by a series of eco
crises.

45
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,220
Manda Scott: Okay, so that gives
us an opening into the birth of

46
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,520
the future human. For those
watching on YouTube, my cat is

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,400
on the desk. It's easier to let
him just ramble across, and then

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,720
he'll go away and it'll be fine
before we go there. So it seems

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,740
to me, let's just address the
politics, because it's a lie for

50
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,260
everyone. This is going out at
the start of the new year 2025.

51
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,360
Is going to be the year when
everything changes. America

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,840
sneezes, the world gets a cold,
and nothing will be the same,

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,020
particularly not geopolitics is
about to shift enormously. I

54
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,920
think a US Russian Alliance has
never happened before, and it

55
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,480
looks like it's arising in real
time. And it seems to me, 71

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,260
million people voted vote for
Trump. That means, by my

57
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,200
reckoning, 259 million didn't.
And yet there's been effectively

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,140
a bloodless coup by the fascist
right. And yet no amount of

59
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,340
ideology, however forcefully
they try to impose it can

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,120
actually overcome biophysical
reality. You cannot stop climate

61
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,080
change by pretending it's not
happening. The ostrich position

62
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,600
is only useful until the flood
waters fill the hole that you've

63
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,780
stuck your head in. Yeah. So it
seems almost to me that also to

64
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,520
me, that the shifts that we
need, need to be inner and

65
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,460
collectively inner, which is
exactly the field that you're

66
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,320
working in. Yeah, and we don't
want to go back over everything

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,320
that you experienced, but I
wonder if you've got a kind of

68
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,760
an elevator pitch of where you
started and where it took you to

69
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,400
in terms of your own spiritual
process is that something that

70
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
we could go into sure

71
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,220
Chris Bache: I can give you a
kind of a quick overview. I

72
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,080
began my psychedelic work when I
was just hired as a university

73
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,020
professor in Northeast Ohio, and
I began this work as a pretty

74
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,240
well educated. Dedicated
agnostic with strong atheistic

75
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,120
inclinations. That's where all
the years of graduate school had

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,200
brought me. But just when I
started teaching, I came across

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,680
the work of Stanislav Grof and
his book, realms of the human

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,220
unconscious, changed the
direction of my life. I saw the

79
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,660
importance of his work from my
discipline, which was philosophy

80
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,420
of religion. I'm not a
psychologist, I'm not a

81
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,340
therapist, I'm a professor of
philosophy of religion. And so I

82
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,200
began an underground regimen of
psychedelic therapy because I

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,440
knew that in order to speak
intelligently using this new

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,180
methodology, you had to do the
work yourself. And even though

85
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,560
it was illegal by this time,
this was 1978 when I started my

86
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,200
career, I started my psychedelic
work in 1979 psychedelics were

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,020
illegal. I made a decision to do
this work in underground

88
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,900
fashion, completely isolated. My
never let my students and most

89
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,440
of my faculty never knew what I
was doing. In this regard, I

90
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,900
continue this work for 20 years.
I started it when I was 30, and

91
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,840
I finished it when I was 50, and
I did 79 high dose LSD sessions,

92
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,700
which is an a very aggressive
protocol. I don't recommend this

93
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
protocol today.

94
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,660
Manda Scott: You did this so we
don't have to, as far as I can

95
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,340
see, and I'm enormously
grateful.

96
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,840
Chris Bache: Yeah. And then I
spent another 20 years digesting

97
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,160
those experiences, writing about
them, integrating them, trying

98
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,020
to integrate them, and written
two books based on those

99
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,160
experiences. One of them is dark
night, early dawn, which came

100
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,900
out in 2000 and probably the
more important one for a wide

101
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,280
audience, is LSD in the mind of
the universe, which came out in

102
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,540
2019 so I did this work for 20
years, and then LSD in the mind

103
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,500
of the universe came out 20
years later, after I stopped,

104
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,440
Manda Scott: after you'd
integrated a lot of what

105
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,980
happened, and after you were
also, it seems, from the book,

106
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,360
just beginning to be able to
start talking about it, because

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,820
you had issues where you
couldn't speak. You physically

108
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,920
couldn't speak, because he
couldn't speak of what you

109
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,520
understood and what you knew.
Can you tell us a little bit

110
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,220
about that that seemed to me
quite an integral part of what

111
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,880
was happening?

112
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,180
Chris Bache: Well, I love
teaching, I love working with

113
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,020
the students. I just really love
being in the classroom. And I

114
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,920
knew that if I began to speak
openly about psychedelics in the

115
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,220
70s, 80s, 90s, even, I very
likely would lose my perfect my

116
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,440
position at the University, and
so I could not speak openly

117
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,120
about my work. I mean, I really
I spoke indirectly by giving

118
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,540
teaching courses on psychedelic
therapy and Stan Grof work and

119
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,540
other people's research. But
like I didn't, wasn't able to

120
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,700
own my experiences publicly at
my university until the very,

121
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,940
very tail end of my career, I
retired in 2011 in order, a

122
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,420
little bit early, in order to
give me time to bring forward

123
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,540
what I consider my most
important work, and my

124
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,740
conviction is that psychedelics
represents a revolution, not

125
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,600
just in therapy, not just a
clinical revolution, but a

126
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,400
revolution in how we do
philosophy and this methodology

127
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,660
is that we move systematically
into very carefully controlled

128
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,380
Non-ordinary states. We
experience them as consciously

129
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,160
as we can. We bring them back,
preserve them, write a detailed

130
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,340
written account within 24 hours,
and then spend some time

131
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,880
digesting them, integrating them
with our other bodies of

132
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,060
knowledge, then going back into
that state and coming in. So

133
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,660
this method of systematically
entering into Non-ordinary

134
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,280
states and coming back
represents a new methodological

135
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,980
platform for the doing of
philosophy. So what we're

136
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,920
looking at is what the emergence
of what I would call a

137
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,460
psychedelic philosophy, the
psychedelic that's grounded on

138
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,060
the systematic application of
Non-ordinary states of

139
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,340
consciousness through the use of
psychedelics.

140
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Manda Scott: Yeah, can I
interrupt you, because this is

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,100
already opening doors, and I'd
like to go down a few of them.

142
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,220
So we're talking about
integrating with other systems.

143
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,240
And in the book, you are
becoming quite deeply involved

144
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,720
in some Buddhist practices. Were
they Buddhist, I think. And so

145
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,220
it strikes me, within the
shamanic world, we get a lot of

146
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,400
people who want to go off and do
Ayahuasca or do mushrooms. And

147
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,180
it seems to me there it's short
cutting and not universally. I

148
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,940
have spoken to people who are
absolutely prepared to go and

149
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,760
spend six months in the forest
alone with the plants and

150
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
integrate it, but there are an
equal number of people who seem

151
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,840
to think they can go from point
A to point. Ed without actually

152
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,500
doing any of the steps in
between. And what I'm think, I'm

153
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,700
hearing from you is that the
steps in between are absolutely

154
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,300
crucial and that they need to be
undertaken in a structured

155
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,100
fashion, in in spite of the fact
that it we feel to me, to be

156
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,520
moving away from the reductive,
scientific space where atoms

157
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,160
move around like billiard balls,
and everything is predictable,

158
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,880
as long as we have enough data
points to a point of where

159
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,640
everything is emergent and
complex and actually nothing is

160
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,160
predictable, but experience, the
phenomenology of living, is what

161
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,360
matters, and the more than human
world comes in and takes part,

162
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,620
it seemed to me, reading,
certainly the second book, to an

163
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,040
extent the first, but
particularly in the second, that

164
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,520
there was an extraordinary
coherence. You had a six year

165
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,100
gap in the middle, and yet when
you when you went back, you

166
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,580
basically took off. It was like
a serial Dream, which those of

167
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,940
us who practice dreaming you
sometimes night after night

168
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,040
after night after night, you're
in the same story. And you were

169
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,760
getting this. You were in an
almost linear progression,

170
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,340
except it was more fractal than
linear, I would say, you

171
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,260
building on previous knowledge,
and you were being taught quite

172
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,620
clearly. And so can you unpick
for us a bit of the structure

173
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,420
that you see that is useful in
order for this to be something

174
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,180
that helps us move towards being
future humans.

175
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,980
Chris Bache: Okay, well, there
several things rolled into your

176
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,160
observations and all good.
They're all good observations.

177
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:46,840
So some process comments. First,
I think integration is very

178
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,860
important. We're finding we have
the technology, the chemical

179
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,420
technology, to trigger very deep
states of consciousness, but

180
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,420
these states of consciousness
may have very little lasting

181
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,240
impact on how our deeply
ingrained psychological cultural

182
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,860
habits, if we don't take time to
sit with these experiences and

183
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,880
integrate them as deeply as we
can into our embodied existence.

184
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,280
And over the course of my work,
I learned that even though I was

185
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,020
paying a lot of attention and
doing as good a job as I could

186
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,740
to integrate each individual
session and doing an adequate

187
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,120
job. I think I still
underestimated the long term

188
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,200
challenges of integrating an
entire spiritual journey, but I

189
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,680
did not fully comprehend this
until I had stopped my journey

190
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,760
at the end and then realized how
hard the stopping hit me, which

191
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,820
then exposed the the imbalance,
the failure to integrate the

192
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,480
radical, the most extreme, most
radical experiences, which were

193
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,400
the deepest experiences, being
drawn into intimacy, into

194
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,600
communion With, I want to say
the divine, but I'm cautious

195
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,260
about that, because we have to
unpack all sorts of theological,

196
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,860
you know,

197
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,400
Manda Scott: distortion on this
podcast, actually, you could we

198
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,620
talk about the heart, mind of
the universe all the time, which

199
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,440
I think is, is, for me, what you
would call the divine. So I

200
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,020
think we can assume that
unpacking has been done in the

201
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,280
past five years.

202
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,220
Chris Bache: The universe is
good. I like. That's why the

203
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,860
book is called LSD. In the mind
of the universe, it could be the

204
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,420
heart mind of the universe,

205
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,779
Manda Scott: but you came to a
point where you were basically

206
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,459
marking time, waiting to die in
order to return to Unity with

207
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,919
the divine. Yes, did I
understand that correctly?

208
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,959
Chris Bache: No, you understood.
You got it correctly. It's kind

209
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,179
of jumping ahead to the story.
Let me back up and work to that

210
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:48,399
point. Okay, if you work, and I
think in order to extract the

211
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,019
maximal psychological, psycho,
spiritual and philosophical

212
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,799
value of these experiences, it's
very important to create a

213
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,879
container, what I call the Kiva
of practice, a container which

214
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:08,639
affords you the best opportunity
for absolutely clear contact

215
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,219
with these deeper states of
consciousness, without

216
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:15,899
interruption, without confusion,
no outside contact. You're in a

217
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,019
therapeutic environment. You're
lying down, you're with a

218
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:25,279
skilled sitter. You're listening
to carefully curated music. It's

219
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,599
a it's a complex process, which
you have to prepare for. You

220
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:32,899
have the session you need.
You're integrating the session

221
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:37,639
acutely for several days after.
So each session takes a week,

222
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:40,519
essentially, to, you know, just
for the immediate session, and

223
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:45,219
then as you build on these
sessions over time, you're

224
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:49,179
right. It's a linear, I found a
linear progression. Relatively

225
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,779
speaking. You know,
consciousness is a holistic

226
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,079
phenomenon. So you may
experience multiple levels of

227
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,559
consciousness simultaneously.
You may experience some deep

228
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:03,899
levels. Of consciousness early
in your journey work, but if you

229
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,199
work systematically, my
experience at least, is that

230
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,339
there was a progressive
deepening, so that I went

231
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:16,679
through rounds of deepening when
I was writing up my journey at

232
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:22,099
the very end, I looked at the
total landscape of my

233
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:27,439
experiences, and I broke it down
into five fundamental landscapes

234
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:31,519
that I had been exploring. One
is personal mind, your personal

235
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,139
unconscious. Second is the
collective mind, the species

236
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:40,479
mind Carl Jung would have called
the collective psyche. Third,

237
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:47,319
archetypal mind. Fourth, causal
mind, the mind of oneness. And

238
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:52,599
fifth, the diamond Luminosity.
So my experience was I would

239
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:56,979
work. I would go through success
of success, succession of death

240
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:59,859
and rebirth experiences.
Eventually I would have a

241
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:04,619
breakthrough that would catapult
me into a new level of

242
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:08,999
consciousness where I would have
to learn how it worked. It was a

243
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:12,239
totally different it was like a
different physics governing this

244
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:17,519
level of reality. I would work
there. I would continue to learn

245
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,599
there. But in that process, I
would go through more

246
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:24,499
purification exercises, more
episodes of death and rebirth

247
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,339
that weren't simply repeating
ego death, but were taking me

248
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,539
into a deeper cycle of death and
rebirth. And eventually that

249
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:36,859
would culminate, and it would I
would have a breakthrough into a

250
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:40,899
completely different level of
reality, and that level of

251
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,959
reality, I would all start over
again. I wouldn't understand how

252
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,259
it would work. It would be
confusing. Then I would keep

253
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:51,759
going back to it. I'd get my sea
legs. I would acclimate to it.

254
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,359
My visionary experience would
get clear. And then I would go

255
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:59,379
and get propelled into another
level of reality. And when I was

256
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:02,699
in the middle of the deepest,
deepest level. I went into the

257
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:07,979
diamond Luminosity. I had an
experience in which I was I had

258
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:11,879
an experience of a level of
Light Beyond the diamond

259
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:16,739
Luminosity, and a ray of light
came out of that reality hit me,

260
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,799
shattered me, and what it taught
me was it's an infinite

261
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,639
progression. It I had thought in
the beginning it was a matter of

262
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:30,019
becoming one with God or getting
to the meta, cosmic void stage

263
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:33,499
of work. But what I found is
that there are many, many levels

264
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:37,339
of God. There are many levels
even of the primal void. That's

265
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:41,379
an infinite progression. You'll
never reach the end to of it,

266
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:46,479
even using as powerful a
protocol as high dose LSD work,

267
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:51,759
and that really is one of the
things that shifted my entire

268
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:57,039
orientation, because if I were
doing it over again, I would be

269
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,319
much gentler with myself. I
would use lower doses. I would

270
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:05,219
balance and vary the psychedelic
that I was using, because I've

271
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:08,879
learned that the goal of the
work is not to get to some end

272
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:13,019
stage or end point, which would,
you, know, change your life

273
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,979
forever, but the goal is simply
to open, let as much of the

274
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:20,119
wisdom of the universe in as
possible, as much of the love as

275
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,799
much of the insight, and then
spend weeks, months, years,

276
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:28,939
integrating that those
experiences changing whatever it

277
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:33,019
is about your life that is
keeping you from experiencing

278
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:38,299
those realities on everyday,
daily basis, and then continuing

279
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:44,439
work. So at the end of my
journey I had I found that I had

280
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:50,139
gone so deep into intimacy with
the divine, into the Divine

281
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,799
Light, dissolving completely
into fields of light,

282
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:59,619
transcending space and time, so
deeply that when I stopped this

283
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:04,799
work and and I'll go later if
you want to why I stopped the

284
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,059
work, but I stopped it after 20
years, and then in the years

285
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:14,459
following, I found that I was
missing the transcendent clarity

286
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:19,379
so deeply that I found I was
just waiting to die so that I

287
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:24,079
could return when I died, and
after reflecting on this for a

288
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,139
long period of time, I began to
realize something's not right.

289
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,679
This is not the way this work is
supposed to end. It's not

290
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,399
healthy. And I spent a lot of
time then studying my work to

291
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:38,839
try to find out where I had gone
wrong. And I realized, I came to

292
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:46,659
realize that I had I had gone so
deeply into Transcendence that I

293
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:51,219
had created an imbalance within
my incarnation, an imbalance

294
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:55,599
which was tilted towards
Transcendence at the expense of

295
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,919
embodied affirming my deeply
physical, embodied existence.

296
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,879
And both of the these are two
fundamental truths. We are

297
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:05,759
always tapped into
Transcendence. We're always

298
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,539
tapped into the physical world.
But I had tilted the balance

299
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:14,459
very far, and I had to make a
conscious choice to reground

300
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:20,279
myself in physical reality so
that I could become more

301
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,379
comfortable. In my own skin, and
this began, and writing LSD in

302
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:30,799
the mind of the universe was a
tremendous help, because I was

303
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,779
speaking about my experiences.
And I'm an academic, and I, you

304
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:41,499
know, I love to talk, so I love
to teach, and by speaking about

305
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:46,239
these experiences, it empowered
my integrating the experiences,

306
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:51,339
and by sharing them publicly,
after so many years of keeping

307
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:55,899
them private, it allowed a
healing to take place inside my

308
00:20:55,899 --> 00:21:00,099
own psyche, between that which
had been hidden and That which

309
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:03,539
had been public between the
higher and that, which is,

310
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:08,519
quote, lower or the Earth year.
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,020
Manda Scott: Again, many doors
opened. We want to come back to

312
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,420
why you ended. I would like to
make clear to people listening.

313
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,180
First of all, this was
industrial doses of LSD, and

314
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
you've explained that you went
through death and rebirth

315
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,080
experiences. I think it's worth
pointing out that there were

316
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,140
points where you were vomiting
so hard for so long that the

317
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,380
vessels in your eyeballs
ruptured. Yeah, it wasn't

318
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,540
sounding like a whole lot of fun
to me. And you also had your

319
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,340
then wife, who was a trained
psychologist, psychotherapist, I

320
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,480
can't remember, but she was very
good at holding the space, so

321
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,980
you had a lot of anchoring. And
it still sounds like the early

322
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,800
part of every single journey was
living hell, as far as I can

323
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,900
tell. Would that be fair?

324
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,260
Chris Bache: Yeah, it's, it's
what I discovered eventually,

325
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,340
that there's a purification
cycle, and early, traditionally,

326
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,240
we would call it the
Death-Rebirth cycle. But we

327
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,000
often think of death as
something that happens to us one

328
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,660
time, and a lot of the
therapeutic literature and

329
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,100
psychedelic work circles focuses
on ego death, which is for me,

330
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,940
is only the first round. And
what I learned later, after

331
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,460
you've died many times in this
process, I mean completely loss

332
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,020
of control, metaphysical
confusion, just complete

333
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,320
surrender to overwhelming,
metaphysical waterfalls. You

334
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,880
learn that first you cannot die.
It's impossible to die. The form

335
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,380
that you are can die. The
structure of life as you have

336
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,160
known it can be extinguished,
but the inner essence of your

337
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,500
being always re emerges. The
Phoenix always rises. And I in

338
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,180
that process, I also learned
that death, what we experience

339
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,200
as death, is actually an
extremely intense form of

340
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,360
purification. When your
purification reaches so deeply

341
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,560
that it reaches into the
fundamental assumptions that

342
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,820
structure your experience of
reality, then death has returned

343
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,920
to grace you, right? So it's
purification breakthrough

344
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,440
experiencing a deeper state, and
if you want to stop at that

345
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,560
level, it's perfectly fine.
Different people use different

346
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,920
psychedelics, different
modalities at different powers,

347
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,000
and some psychedelics only have
sufficient power to reach

348
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,380
certain levels. Happened that
the method that I was using, the

349
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,420
substance I was using, was so
powerful, it had the power to

350
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,680
keep breaking me through level
after level in this systematic

351
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,380
fashion. Yeah.

352
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,660
Manda Scott: And did you choose
LSD because of Stan Grof and and

353
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,780
it was the thing back in the 70s
at that I suppose that's a head

354
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,600
mind question, but my spirit
mind question is, you could have

355
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,540
done a lot of different things.
Ayahuasca wasn't around much,

356
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,480
but mushrooms were there were
other things that were there. Do

357
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,180
you think that whatever it is
that guides you through this

358
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,720
incarnation led you to that
because you said you wouldn't do

359
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,020
it again now, but you wouldn't
be who you are now if you hadn't

360
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,380
gone through the Erdogan, the
military, the military version

361
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,920
of completely destroying
yourself many times. Can you

362
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,580
speak to that?

363
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,020
Chris Bache: Well, to understand
why I chose LSD, you have to go

364
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:35,840
back to 1979 1980 Ayahuasca was
still not yet on the playing

365
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,680
field for the most part. Just
early mushrooms certainly were.

366
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,500
I understood LSD to be more
powerful than mushrooms. So the

367
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,060
primary reason, though, is that
my work was based upon Stan Grof

368
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,140
work, and I trusted Stan. I
trusted his research, and Stan

369
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,720
did most of his work with LSD.
So that's where I dug in. I dug

370
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,700
in there. Later. After I
finished my 20 year journey,

371
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,100
I've done many psychedelics.
I've done mushrooms and five MEO

372
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,560
and salvia divinorum and San
Pedro, different psychedelics in

373
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,900
Ayahuasca, which are beautiful,
and they've taught me a lot, and

374
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,420
I have a certain sense of that
each of these psychedelics

375
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,440
impact the spectrum of
consciousness, or open some

376
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,880
portion of the spectrum of
consciousness. The the kind of

377
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,080
contact I experience with
Psilocybin, for example, is very

378
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,720
body grounded, very emotional.
Body grounded. LSD tends to be

379
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,640
have a high cosmological ceiling
tendency, certainly at high

380
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,080
doses, it tends to push the high
ceiling, whereas Psilocybin is

381
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,520
much more grounded earthy in my
earthly existence.

382
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,000
Manda Scott: Yeah, and it's
seems to me, it's more to do

383
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,920
with opening doors into the rest
of the web of life, rather than

384
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,740
necessarily cosmic awareness.
Not that the two are mutually

385
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
exclusive, but there's, as you
were saying, there's a tilt one

386
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,640
way or the other tilt. Yeah, I
want to move towards the future

387
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,140
human. But just before we go
there, I'm wondering how was it

388
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,140
taken in academic circles when
you wrote these books? Were

389
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,800
there people who then came to
and went, Yes, I've been wanting

390
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,260
to do this, or I have been doing
this, and thank you for opening

391
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,440
the doors. Or were there others
for whom the door was now shut

392
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,340
and you your access was denied?
How did it land with your

393
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:31,700
people?

394
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,480
Chris Bache: My work has been
well received in the

395
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,240
consciousness community and in
the academic community. They

396
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,180
don't even know I exist. For the
most part, it's been ignored.

397
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,340
There hasn't been a single
professional review published of

398
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:53,800
my work out of a hardcore
academic philosophy journal or

399
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,240
religious studies journal.

400
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,540
Manda Scott: But you must have
friends who could publish in

401
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,340
those journals. You must have
ways into that if, if people

402
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,900
wanted to, is it just not worth
their career to do that?

403
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,139
Chris Bache: You know, I just
one of the things I decided

404
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:15,299
early on in my career was not to
try to address the reservations

405
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,899
which were abundantly clear to
me coming out of the traditional

406
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:24,259
academic mindset. I decided that
if I tried to justify the method

407
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:28,639
and justify the experiences to
my colleagues, it would it would

408
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:32,299
hamper me, it would hold me
back. I just decided to push

409
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:38,479
deeply ahead and let the chips
fall where they may and and I

410
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:44,619
understand how exotic, how
strange my claims are, how they

411
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:48,699
sound to people, right? You
know, raised educated in a

412
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:52,899
traditional environment, and
I've just decided to let that go

413
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:57,639
and let history sort things out.
I am acutely aware that I'm

414
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:01,799
writing not from my present
generation. I'm writing for my

415
00:28:01,859 --> 00:28:08,279
for future generations. Who
will, you know, paradigm change

416
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:13,079
take place in evolutionary
context, and so I'm just doing

417
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:17,339
the work and letting other
people sort out what they think

418
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:19,019
it's worth and with any

419
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,840
Manda Scott: luck, I already
give my it to be one of your

420
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,220
students and it sounds like
there are, particularly we

421
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,640
touched on the earlier moments
when you were having what we

422
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,880
would now consider to be psychic
experiences where you knew

423
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,060
things that from non ordinary
reality, not when you're on the

424
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,300
LSD, but just when you were
teaching and then, and then you

425
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,700
had to hold them in, because if
you said something, It was

426
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,980
basically going to blow
everybody's fuses. And there

427
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,460
fuses, and they were going to
wonder how you knew it and

428
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,940
explain how you knew it. But
those students I am thinking,

429
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,900
have been in the in the field of
your awareness, at a point when

430
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,280
you are experiencing, I've begun
to see the world in a different

431
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,520
space. So with any luck, they'll
go off and change the world.

432
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,760
Chris Bache: So I'll tell you
one aspect about that particular

433
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,400
I never let my students know
that I was doing this work, but

434
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,600
I began to find that even though
they didn't know about my

435
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,680
psychedelic work, they began to
have experiences which were

436
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,060
moving, showing that they were
being impacted by my psychedelic

437
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:29,420
work. And secondly, my work was
changing me at a deep structural

438
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,980
level, so that my person became
a lightning rod that was

439
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,780
sparking transformational
insights or breakthroughs among

440
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,040
my students without me
consciously intending it. I

441
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,440
began when I would be lecturing.
I was drawing into my lecture

442
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,360
examples which were purely
random for me, but the examples

443
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,500
I was being told were actually
exactly the same thing that had

444
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,240
been happening to my students
that week, and the thing. Things

445
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,900
I was saying began to touch them
in very, very deep, personal,

446
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,640
intimate places, places they
were wounded, places they were

447
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,140
blocked from going forward. This
became such a common feature of

448
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,360
my work that eventually I spent
a lot of time studying this and

449
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,000
developing an entirely new way
of teaching to take into account

450
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,880
the truths that I was
discovering in the classroom and

451
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:31,220
in my psychedelic work that
revolved around the boundaryless

452
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,360
nature of consciousness. Fields
of consciousness that fields

453
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,080
develop in groups, there's an
energetic resonance which

454
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,700
happens underneath the verbal
exchange of ideas as a

455
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,360
consciousness, directly engaging
consciousness. And so I

456
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,760
published a book in 2008 after I
stopped my sessions called the

457
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,920
living classroom in which I lay
it all out. But I never

458
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,440
mentioned psychedelics, because
the issue is not psychedelics.

459
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,440
The issue is consciousness, the
potential of consciousness. So

460
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,960
if you do very deep
consciousness work without

461
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,260
psychedelics, I think you can
trigger the same things that I

462
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,460
experienced. But eventually,
just recently this actually,

463
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,140
this month, SUNY press is
bringing out a second edition of

464
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,480
the living classroom, and in
this edition, they invited me to

465
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,540
tell the truth about my
psychedelic practice, because

466
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm out of the closet by now.
LSD, in the mind of the universe

467
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,220
was out. So the new edition of
the living classroom makes clear

468
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,580
that it was my psychedelic
practice that was driving the

469
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,320
phenomena that were emerging in
my classes, even though I think

470
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,920
other people not using
psychedelics can experience the

471
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,020
same thing, so that's that's a
whole nother, another aspect

472
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,100
that has to do with integration.
Because integration here means

473
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,760
taking care, not only of
yourself, but taking care of

474
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,860
anyone whom your practice
touches, which for me, included

475
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,020
many of my students, and 1/3 of
the book is just essays that my

476
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,920
students have written, very deep
essays, personal essays about

477
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,700
their own spiritual experiences,
their experience of death. It's

478
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,560
that's a beautiful section of
the book,

479
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,200
Manda Scott: right? I will find
that and put a link in the show

480
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,500
notes. And you were still
teaching the philosophy of

481
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,620
religion at this point you
hadn't branched out into other

482
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,340
things. Is that?

483
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,340
Chris Bache: Right? Yeah, I was
teaching classically Religious

484
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,520
Studies courses, Introduction to
world religions, Eastern

485
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,140
religions, Buddhism, psychology
of religion, mysticism and

486
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,900
meditation. You know, classic
curriculum.

487
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,680
Manda Scott: Gosh, I wish they
were the classic curriculum when

488
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,700
I went through but with my my
senior apprentice. And I don't

489
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,880
work with psychedelics, but we
work, we teach shamanic studies.

490
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,660
And I found, even when I'm
talking about the book in front

491
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,880
of a literary festival, that's
that basically full of ordinary

492
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,300
middle class people who've come
along and had nothing better to

493
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,120
do, and wanted to get out of the
rain, as far as I can tell. And

494
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,000
we end up drawing in examples
that seem to come out of

495
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,300
nowhere. And then someone goes,
Oh, you just mentioned Boston,

496
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,580
and something about streets in
Boston, about which I know

497
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,700
precisely nothing. I come from
Boston, and the streets are just

498
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,080
like that. So so I'm sure that
what you said is absolutely true

499
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,000
and and at a deeper level when
we're teaching a held circle,

500
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,360
then then the resonances move
across the circle, but becoming

501
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,560
aware of these such that
everyone in the circle is

502
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,460
engaging with that strikes me as
a step towards future humanism,

503
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:39,440
if we're I think we're becoming
conscious of the things that can

504
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,460
help us to be different humans.

505
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,780
Chris Bache: Once you understand
how fields work, and once you

506
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,680
develop a protocol that
maximizes potential of the

507
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,860
emergence of conscious of these
consciousness changing fields

508
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,940
within groups, then you you do
it in a way that accelerates. It

509
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,620
deepens not only the learning
experience, but it accelerates

510
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,820
the transformational value of
these exercises for everyone

511
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,320
involved. And this applies not
just to university courses. It

512
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,680
applies in research
laboratories, in boardrooms,

513
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,980
wherever citizens gather in
sustained conversations, which

514
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,180
is where most of our change
takes place, in dialog with

515
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:28,400
other human beings. And so this
is very relevant to the

516
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,440
challenge moving into, yeah,

517
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,420
Manda Scott: yes, so let's go
there. So let's lay out where I

518
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,300
think roughly we're at. And you
can tell me, because you live in

519
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,320
the US, and I'm just watching it
with kind of squinched up eyes

520
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,080
from across the water waiting
for it to come over here. Musk

521
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,840
has already said he's going to
basically buy the next election,

522
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,660
and we have always had the best
democracy money could buy. So

523
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,980
unless we can change the
democratic process, that's it.

524
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,200
So Moscow and Starlink, I've
been floating across substack

525
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,520
watching something. Very
interesting, very geeky people

526
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,100
pointing out how he managed to
steal the election and how the

527
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,860
numbers don't add up. But you
know, if you're going to feed

528
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,800
everything through Starlink, the
person who owns the Starlink can

529
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,340
make it say what they want it to
say. You and I are talking

530
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,440
across many 1000s of miles using
technology that, in the end, is

531
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,320
basically owned by an individual
who might be very interesting,

532
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,720
but I don't necessarily want
them knowing everything that I

533
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,620
think can do. So it seems to me
that evolution only happens

534
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,080
under moments of intense
pressure. I would like this

535
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,320
moment not to become any more
intensely pressurized. Probably

536
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,920
will, but yeah, this is as much
as I ever want. Therefore, can

537
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,740
we evolve our consciousness to
become future humans. And it

538
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,580
seems to me that you have a
doorway and a framework and a

539
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,880
concept within which that could
happen. Does that? How does that

540
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,480
land with you?

541
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,580
Chris Bache: That all aligns
fine, and I think you're

542
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,340
absolutely correct. I'm not sure
that I have a doorway that I

543
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,420
would recommend as such, but I
do think that psychedelics have

544
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,560
entered our historical scene at
precisely a time when we need

545
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,400
more awareness. We need it for
therapeutic, prosperous

546
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,720
processes. We need it for
political processes. We need to

547
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,960
wake up and grow. And so I think
it's historically important. And

548
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,520
there are 1000s and 1000s of
people working conscientiously,

549
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,420
not superficially, but very
conscientiously, working with

550
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,160
psychedelics in order to heal
the accumulated trauma of many

551
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,680
lifetimes and to open up a
deeper communion with the

552
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,040
intelligence that's resides
within the universe to help us

553
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,360
make a transition from a
mechanical, Dead universe of

554
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,100
dead matter to a living universe
that's alive at its core, that's

555
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,920
expressing its intentionality
through the quantum jumps that

556
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,240
take place in our evolutionary
journey. And I think we are

557
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,880
coming into a quantum jump right
now, in a nutshell. Well, let me

558
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,380
back up a sec. This chapter, the
birth of the future human, and

559
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,940
everything that it contains is
completely came into my work by

560
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,460
complete surprise. I thought of
myself doing the work I was

561
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,460
doing for personal
transformation, personal

562
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,080
healing, maybe even personal
enlightenment. But what happened

563
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,680
is that the method was so
powerful it pushed beyond all

564
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,940
those categories, and I had to
reframe my understanding of the

565
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,340
boundaries of conscientious
psychedelic work in a way that

566
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,200
dropped the model of personal
transformation and opened up

567
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,360
into a model of collective
transformation. I had years and

568
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,620
years of experiences where the
shadow that I was engaging was

569
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,600
not my personal shadow. I did
that work, but this was a

570
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,740
collective shadow. The pain and
the excruciating suffering that

571
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,260
I was processing had to do with
the pain of my entire species.

572
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,340
And there that I came to
understand that there is a

573
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:20,900
collective psyche that that
holds the trauma of humanity's

574
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,760
history, just as our individual
psyche holds the trauma of our

575
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,440
individual history, and this
collective trauma and collective

576
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,820
pain encumbers the free
functioning of the collective

577
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:39,140
psyche, just as our individual
trauma encumbers our individual

578
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:46,420
health and well being. So by
doing this work, I began to

579
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,500
understand that something in the
universe was using my sessions

580
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:56,560
to make a small contribution to
healing the collective psyche in

581
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,620
order to make it more available
to the influx of energy from

582
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:07,620
divine consciousness to allow it
to manifest more completely in

583
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,460
humanity.

584
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,120
Manda Scott: Now that that bit,
can you just say that again?

585
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,320
Because I think that's really
important. It's not that it's

586
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,320
that opening of the door to
something that's trying to come

587
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,340
in. Is that what I just heard
you say, can you just repeat

588
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,320
that? Because I think that needs
emphasizing.

589
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,340
Chris Bache: I think we're
living at a time of ascending

590
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:32,120
spiritual energy. There's, it's
almost like there's an influx of

591
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:38,600
higher light energy, spiritual
energy, pushing in on us and our

592
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,440
the pain of our history, the
karma of our narrowness of our

593
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,460
smallness of our trying to live
within a framework of individual

594
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:55,180
ego, at cost of anyone else's
well being, keeps us locked away

595
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,720
unsen insensitive to this
incoming light and as. In any

596
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,760
mystical development before
there is a breakthrough into non

597
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,360
dual or unitive consciousness,
there is a dark night of the

598
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,860
soul where you have to undo, you
have to let go of all of the

599
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,940
obstacles, all the blocks. And I
think this is happening at a

600
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,980
collective level, not only
inside intense psychedelic

601
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,720
sessions, but everywhere. If
you're doing past life therapy,

602
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,760
many of the lives that come up
to be cleansed or not

603
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,660
necessarily your personal former
lives, but they can be lives

604
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,600
within the system social
movements to end child abuse, to

605
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,640
End Abuse of our daughters, to
end racism, to end speciesism.

606
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,360
These things are tackling. These
movements are tackling pains

607
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,680
which are much deeper than
simply our personal pain and we

608
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,420
are. The whole system is kind of
straining against the burdens of

609
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,000
the past in order to open
itself, to take in more

610
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,440
powerfully, the energy of our
future, the light of our future.

611
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,660
So So in that context, in the
middle of this work, I began to

612
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,800
receive visions that were
stable, they were consistent,

613
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,120
and they stretched over several
years. They were dropped into my

614
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,280
sessions about where humanity is
in its evolutionary journey,

615
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,600
where it's going, and there was
a message of we were coming into

616
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,800
a time of radical, Pivotal
breakthrough, a before and

617
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,060
after, time that the past would
become quickly irrelevant,

618
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,100
because something fundamentally
new was emerging, but it never

619
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,600
showed me. For years how nature
was going to accomplish this. I

620
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:53,680
had no idea. And then in 1995
years later, I had a fundamental

621
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,000
experience where and I was
working at very deep levels. By

622
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,860
this time, I was into the
diamond Luminosity material. But

623
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,700
this session took me and it
broke me open. It dissolved my

624
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,620
mind into the species mind, and
then asked the consciousness of

625
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,780
the species. And I understand
how radical an assertion that

626
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,520
is, and I don't take it lightly,
but the species mind opened into

627
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,660
it took me into future time. It
took me into what I call deep

628
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,280
time. And in that future, I
experienced the death and

629
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,540
rebirth of humanity. I
experienced humanity coming to

630
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,440
an absolute breaking point, a
point of breakdown, an

631
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,560
unraveling of fundamental trust,
fundamental convictions within

632
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,820
our culture, a deep,
systematically, systematic

633
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,860
breaking down until the entire
planet, it seemed, was faced

634
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:56,500
with the task of mere survival,
just trying to survive. And it

635
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,800
looked like it was an extinction
event. At first it looked like

636
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,200
that was it. We were we had
overloaded the system so badly,

637
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,960
we had overdrawn the ecological
balance sheet of the planet, so

638
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,100
badly that we weren't going to
come out of it. But then what

639
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,940
happened in the visionary
experiences? Just when things

640
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:24,200
were at their worst, we began
things began to get lighter. We

641
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,820
and people who had been brought
to their knees, began to stand

642
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:35,420
up, and it began to reconstate.
And as we reconstulated After

643
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,020
these series of crises, and I
don't know how long they will

644
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,720
last, I think of this as kind of
a three generational pivot. I

645
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,140
can't imagine it lasting less
than that. It seems to be the

646
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,780
21st Century is a major pivotal
point, because we know by by

647
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,920
2030 2040, 2050, we're going to
be getting into worse and worse

648
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,460
and worse. Yes, environmental
crises. And I think what ha what

649
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,720
I think is happening is that by
the time we go through this

650
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,700
crisis, will we will crack open
something so deep in the human

651
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,320
spirit, so deep in the human
psyche, that what will emerge is

652
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,600
a literally transformed
humanity, not simply transformed

653
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,620
individuals, but a
transformation of the

654
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,300
fundamental substructure of the
human psyche. I think of this as

655
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,500
a shift in the plate tectonics
of the collective unconscious,

656
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:38,240
so that every human being born
after this period of history

657
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,820
will be experiencing
consciousness within the context

658
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,260
of a collective psyche that is
different than how we were

659
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,080
experiencing it in the 19th and
20th century

660
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,320
Manda Scott: now, or for a long
time before that, within our

661
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,460
time before that.

662
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,180
Chris Bache: Yeah. Now, there's
another theme that came in where

663
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,880
it gave me some. Of the details
of what the future human is, and

664
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,840
and then other sessions, I was
taken far into the future and

665
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,800
experience the this archetypal,
new archetype of the future

666
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,500
human. But in a very profound
experience, I had an experience

667
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,560
of, I believe in reincarnation.
I My first book was on

668
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,260
reincarnation. I think the
empirical evidence for

669
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,080
reincarnation, from a
philosopher's perspective, is

670
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,680
overwhelming. That's how I'll
put those cards on the table.

671
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,560
It's always been part of my
thinking while I went into these

672
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,620
sessions based on the evidence,
not because of religious

673
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,240
beliefs, and I experienced
reincarnation dynamics many

674
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,800
times in my sessions, not only
my personal reincarnational

675
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,000
history, but I experienced
reincarnation as a dynamic

676
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,940
process for the entire planet.
The entire species is pulsing in

677
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,140
the rhythm of reincarnation. And
if that's true, that

678
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,840
reincarnation is a basic fact of
life, then we have been we have

679
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,400
been building the future human
for hundreds of 1000s of years,

680
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,900
we have been growing bit by bit,
bit by bit, bit by bit. We

681
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,260
remember our former lives,
usually when we die and we

682
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,600
return to the domain of the
soul. But I think we are coming

683
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,280
into a point of history where
the soul is actually coming,

684
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,200
becoming conscious inside our
historical existence. And the

685
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,120
way I experienced this was one
day in my session, former lives

686
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,580
were coming into me, just coming
into me. And it was like

687
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:42,640
wrapping bright white light
filament around a kite spool.

688
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,360
And there came a moment where
they seemed to hit critical

689
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,100
mass, and when they hit critical
mass, they fused into one, and

690
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,660
when they fused into one, there
was an explosion of diamond

691
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,380
light from my heart, and I was
catapulted into a state of

692
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,320
consciousness where I was an
individual, but I was far beyond

693
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,320
Chris Bache. I was an individual
like I had never known

694
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,000
individuality before. And I came
to call this the birth of the

695
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,900
diamond soul. Now many people
are experiencing this. They give

696
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,860
it different names. How I call
it is simply my way of

697
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,540
languaging at the birth of the
diamond soul. And I think what's

698
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:28,400
happening is that the soul,
which is the consciousness that

699
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,920
holds all our former life
history, is waking up inside our

700
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,320
historical existence and is
supplanting egoic existence, so

701
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,420
that we have lived egoic
existence for 1000s and 1000s of

702
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:49,120
years, but now the ego has
driven the planet into red line

703
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,980
conditions, into unacceptable,
stressful conditions, and now we

704
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,080
either grow up or we go extinct.
And what growing up amounts to,

705
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,960
I think, is owning the deep
history and the deep

706
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,100
consciousness, which is our
truer nature. It's all divine,

707
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:14,340
of course, but the form of the
Divine is our soul nature. And

708
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,780
it's not just individuals, I
mean, who are waking up, but now

709
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,660
nature is putting enormous
pressure to wake up the entire

710
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,240
species. The entire species is
becoming a species of Christ, a

711
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,040
species of Buddhas, a species of
Prophets, of great spiritual

712
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,780
saints and sages of of history.
That's the pivot we're trying to

713
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,340
make. We're trying to make the
pivot of growing up, taking the

714
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:49,540
long view, the seven generation
view, really looking at and when

715
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,320
the soul wakes up, of course,
the whole our whole history

716
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,040
becomes kind of dynamically
alive within us. We have been

717
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,320
male, female, we have been every
race on the planet. We've been

718
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,040
every religion on the planet,
all of these relative

719
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:10,200
Manda Scott: on the other
species, absolutely.

720
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,260
Chris Bache: And so I think
that's what's happening. And I

721
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:20,660
think we are being brought to a
critical choice point driven by

722
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,220
the ecological crisis and the
other systemic crises which are

723
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:31,400
contingent upon the economic
realities of the past. We're

724
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,020
coming into a meltdown point of
those realities, a choice point.

725
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,260
Manda Scott: So definitely, I
totally take what you're saying,

726
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,500
and I would agree with it, if
somebody is listening to this

727
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,320
podcast, pretty much, by
definition, they still have an

728
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,900
amount of resource and
privilege, because they have the

729
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:55,420
time and the resources to do
that. And I hear you that this

730
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,860
is perhaps a three generation
span, but I'm wondering where

731
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,280
we. Are in those three
generations. We might not be the

732
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,460
first or the three generations
alive on the planet. At the

733
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,640
moment, the kind of Boomers, Gen
X, Gen Z, but then all the

734
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,660
others that we've got, more than
three generations alive, anybody

735
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,200
listening, wherever they are in
the span of age or gender or

736
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:21,320
race, what would you recommend?
As clearly, we don't have a

737
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,620
formula go and do this and this
and this, but the concepts

738
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,700
within which they could
prioritize their life, this is

739
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,760
where this is going out on New
Year's Day. So what do we do

740
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,020
between, what do we create as
our soul, as in s, O, Ul,

741
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:41,320
priorities for 2025, that would
help to move this process

742
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,520
forward. Yeah, a

743
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,600
Chris Bache: couple of quick
background assumptions that I

744
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,380
make. One is that this is a
transition which will take the

745
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,820
entire resources of the human
family. So there is no one

746
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,780
formula. It'll take everything
we have, everything we are.

747
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,040
It'll take scientific knowledge,
economic knowledge, political

748
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,700
skills, educational skills,
medical skills. It'll take

749
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,620
everything we have to move us
through. Second thing is, my

750
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,960
assumption is, and this is based
upon years of studying the past

751
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,260
life literature, that each one
of us has chosen where and when

752
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:26,420
to incarnate with a certain pre
vision of what we're getting

753
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,080
into and what will be the
dominant themes of that

754
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,740
incarnation and the resources
available within that

755
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,940
incarnation, that this is part
of our incarnational psychic

756
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:44,800
makeup, And that means each one
of us is already positioned by

757
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:51,040
the soul, by our soul, to make a
contribution to this transition

758
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,300
that we are coming into. So it's
not a matter of looking around

759
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,020
outside of oneself or somewhere
else. It's a matter of looking

760
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:04,020
deeply into where we are, what
we are. The key question is, not

761
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,360
so much, what can I do? The key
question, I think, is, will we

762
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:15,000
have the courage to do what is
within my reach to do? That's

763
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,200
the key question. If everybody
does what is within their reach

764
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,200
to do, we will make it through
this now, going one step beyond

765
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,460
that. There are many people, I
think, who are giving us good,

766
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,980
wise elder advice on how to
engage this moment in history,

767
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:40,240
how to move it forward. Very
simply put, I believe one of the

768
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,820
ways to do this is to become
what you believe the planet

769
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:51,520
needs right now, to become it in
your own personal life, to be to

770
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,800
internalize the beliefs, the
habits of mind, the generosity

771
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,740
of heart, the clarity of our
thinking and our social skills

772
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:06,480
and social community networks to
become what the planet needs. If

773
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,100
you have a clear understanding
of what the planet needs, and we

774
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:16,380
begin to do that, then we become
kind of a microcosm of the whole

775
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:22,280
evolutionary pivot and what is
alive within us stimulates and

776
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,140
activates what is the people
around us who are struggling to

777
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,620
do the same thing? So we're all
in this together. Our arms are

778
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:34,700
all interlinked. One cell
awakens another cell.

779
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,420
Manda Scott: Yes, the field
effect you were talking about

780
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,440
earlier. If we can come into
alignment, connect to the web of

781
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,760
life. Ask, what do you wanted me
and be that? Yeah. Then that in

782
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,880
itself, ripples out, and it
stops our head minds having to

783
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,440
plan, which seems to me quite a
letting, letting heart, mind

784
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,420
lead and head mind follow, is an
inversion of how we got here,

785
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,080
but seems to me quite important.

786
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,440
Chris Bache: For example, we
think that the future human, the

787
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:09,300
planet, needs more of a heart
based epistemology, a heart

788
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,380
based source of action. And so
to put the heart mind kind of

789
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:19,020
ahead of the mind, mind the mind
head mind, that's a reading of

790
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,800
what's emerging, of what we need
to do, right,

791
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,080
Manda Scott: right, and the and
our understanding may yet

792
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,540
evolve. I wouldn't say that's
necessarily an end point, but

793
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:31,400
it's it's a starting place to
move from here. This is Chris

794
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,060
learning

795
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,960
Chris Bache: deeply biomimicry,
learning the rhythms of nature,

796
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,320
learning what's alive and what's
in the in the physical world, in

797
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,700
the animal world, in the world
of insects, everything around

798
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:47,440
us, understanding how we have
created imbalance, how we can

799
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,640
restore systems, how to create
harmony with those systems, how

800
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,760
to learn from the engineering
that nature has already

801
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,180
accomplished through billions of
years of evolution within those

802
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,920
systems, so many ways.

803
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,800
Manda Scott: Yes, and, and I'm
thinking healing the trauma, if

804
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,560
Francis Waller is right, and we
are the trauma culture and the

805
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,920
indigenous peoples are are more
whole version of humanity. We

806
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,180
have 10,000 years of ancestral
trauma and potentially previous

807
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,280
life trauma. And it seems to me
that I end up talking sometimes

808
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,280
with people who are fixated on
healing their ancestors, and I

809
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,640
am increasingly feeling that if
I can heal in the moment, that

810
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,180
that ripples up and down the
timeline, that time is not

811
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,200
necessarily one linear thing
chucked into identical portions,

812
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,240
but that healing now, if I can
become a fully realized human

813
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,780
being, yeah, that ripples to my
parents and their parents and

814
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,180
their parents all the way back
down the line, and I don't know

815
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,360
how physical descendants, but
down a spirit descendant line,

816
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,740
and that that saves me feeling
that I have to heal 10,000 years

817
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,900
of ancestors, which is a big
Ask, and quite demoralizing. How

818
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,620
does that land?

819
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,760
Chris Bache: It lands Well, now
within a reincarnational

820
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,860
framework, we add the writer
that we were our ancestors. So

821
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:15,660
we can think of our ancestors in
this way we were our ancestors.

822
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,900
So when we're healing our
ancestors in part, we're healing

823
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,180
our own lineage. But anybody
worth their salt, any mother,

824
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,860
any father worth their salt, who
sees a child which is not their

825
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:33,740
own, in need, in pain, actually
reaches out to help heal that

826
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:38,000
child. So healing, once you
really immerse yourself in that

827
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,340
process, the boundaries of
healing. Expand that, healing

828
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,760
the trauma of ancestors, healing
the traumas of your neighbors,

829
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,800
healing the trauma of actually
creating traumaless societies

830
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,720
for our future children. It's
it's all good work. It's all

831
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,900
hard work, and it's the work of
the hours, right?

832
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,460
Manda Scott: And people, I have
a suspicion, are going to be

833
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,400
emailing me afterwards, asking
where they can get enough LSD to

834
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,300
start on the process. Read the
book first people, because Chris

835
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,240
did things that the rest of us,
I don't necessarily think we

836
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,900
want to do, but psychedelics are
big now. Is it your belief that

837
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,460
everyone should be within a
structured and held way and with

838
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,700
suitable reflection exploring
psychedelics. Or is it that a

839
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,180
critical mass does that and the
effect rolls out to the rest of

840
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:32,540
us?

841
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,100
Chris Bache: I don't think it's
wise for everybody to have a

842
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,540
value that everybody should try
psychedelics. Get into

843
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,500
psychedelics. Psychedelics are
basically amplifiers of

844
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,100
consciousness. They amplify
consciousness. What you do with

845
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,760
those amplified states of
awareness in those precious

846
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,540
hours really determines the
value how you use them. You can

847
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,140
use them recreationally. You can
go to a Grateful Dead concert.

848
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,720
You can talk with some friends,
or you can use them to expose

849
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,740
your shadow, to heal your
shadow, and to move into deeper

850
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:13,140
cosmological exploration. But
many of us are carrying tensions

851
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:18,240
within our psyche which should
not be amplified, and this I

852
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,580
mean Carl Jung would listen to
people's dreams on their first

853
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,400
day when they came to work with
them. And he wouldn't work with

854
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,900
some people because he knew that
they were not ready to undertake

855
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,980
the depth of work that would
emerge working with him. And I

856
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,140
think this is true for
psychedelics. There are some

857
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,800
people who should there are a
lot of people who should not use

858
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,560
psychedelics. The circumstances,
the patterns of their

859
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,180
consciousness. Currently, it's
too strong a medicine. They need

860
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:56,740
a gentler way in, slower way in.
But among people who are, say,

861
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:01,140
basically healthy, a healthy
psyche we're not caring.

862
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,820
Manda Scott: Do you know anyone
who has a healthy psyche?

863
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,660
Chris Bache: I know somebody
have a healthier psyche.

864
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,120
Manda Scott: Yes, yes. I'm
thinking of a lot of my friends

865
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,580
who are just really wounded
guys. I think a lot of people

866
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,340
that I know have have healthier
psyches. But I think all of us

867
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,820
are carrying quite deep, frozen
hearts still.

868
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,020
Chris Bache: And if you go in,
if you're working, choose to

869
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,380
work with psychedelics, I would
say, very controlled

870
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:27,980
circumstances. You know, you
really want to batten down the

871
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,100
hive just carefully before you
set out into the deep water.

872
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:38,060
Very conscientious control of
dose, first, purity of

873
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,900
substance, because that's always
an issue. And, you know, pure

874
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,420
substance, because a lot of crap
comes in. What you get on the

875
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:49,240
street, pure substances, careful
containers, therapeutic

876
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,260
structure, you know,
therapeutically monitored,

877
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,820
structured experiences. Groups
are, I don't think it's good to

878
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,580
do what I did to work solo. Uh,
it adds unnecessary burden. It's

879
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,600
good to have a group, even

880
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,540
Manda Scott: though you were
held by the person who held you.

881
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,900
Chris Bache: I was held by I
wasn't totally alone. I was held

882
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:14,760
by my wife, uh, Carol, that my
manager was a PhD psychologist,

883
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,440
but it wasn't healthy in the
sense that I didn't have a group

884
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,760
that I could share my
experiences with beyond that

885
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,240
inner circle, I wasn't able to
talk about it and to take in

886
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:31,640
other people's experiences until
way too far down the road. So

887
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:37,160
you know, Ayahuasca communities,
Psilocybin communities, where

888
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,440
people can work, journey
together, process together, be a

889
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:46,300
mirror to each other. Help
expose the shadow in their post

890
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,860
session personalities. The
greatest danger of working with

891
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:55,540
psychedelics is psychic
inflation, right? You can think

892
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,080
that because

893
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,960
Manda Scott: you have become God
now I can tell you everything.

894
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,100
Chris Bache: Yeah, exactly, we
just because you've had a

895
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:06,360
special experience, you think
you're a special person, and you

896
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,180
know it that's just a big
fallacy.

897
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,020
Manda Scott: Yeah, there's
Ayahuasca is in the incoming

898
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,600
administration in the US, or at
least not Ayah scares, but

899
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,900
people who have taken Ayahuasca
in the incoming administration

900
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,340
in the US, and, yeah, yeah. I'm
sure they're wonderful human

901
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:28,760
beings, but breaking everything,
yeah. And I think one of the

902
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,720
things that I heard from an
Ayahuasca who has spent very

903
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,180
large amounts of time in the
forest is that Western people

904
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,300
tend to want to come and do it
and go away again, and don't

905
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,420
want to spend the weeks and
months of really getting to know

906
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:48,760
the plant and letting go of the
ego. It's, yeah, it's a process,

907
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,760
not an event, long process.
We're not used to that in our

908
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,120
culture.

909
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:54,939
Chris Bache: And let me
recommend a book on Ayahuasca to

910
01:01:54,939 --> 01:01:58,539
your read to your audience, and
that is Bill Barnard's book

911
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:03,479
published by Columbia University
Press, which is insignificant,

912
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:07,499
and his book is liquid light.
And Bill is a university

913
01:02:07,499 --> 01:02:11,879
professor at Southern Methodist
University. He had several books

914
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:16,799
under his belt. He's a very well
recognized philosopher of

915
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:21,019
religion. He has a book on
William James, a book on Henri

916
01:02:21,019 --> 01:02:26,179
Berkson, but the book liquid
light tells a story of years and

917
01:02:26,179 --> 01:02:30,559
years and years decades of going
down to South America, living in

918
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,459
the Santo dynamic community,
working every sabbatical and

919
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:38,659
every vacation with his teachers
there. And it's a it's an

920
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:41,979
analysis of the scientific
dynamic community, and it's also

921
01:02:41,979 --> 01:02:46,419
an analysis of his own
experiences in the Santo dynamic

922
01:02:46,419 --> 01:02:50,679
community. So it's another
academic becoming

923
01:02:51,399 --> 01:02:54,759
autobiographical without being
trapped within his personal

924
01:02:54,759 --> 01:02:58,899
story. And it's specifically
focused and he is a beautiful

925
01:02:58,899 --> 01:03:03,599
writer, and his experiences are
very powerful, brilliant.

926
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,960
Manda Scott: I will find that
and put it in the show notes. I

927
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,020
could go on forever we are
heading towards the end of time,

928
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,520
the end of our time, not
necessarily the end of all time.

929
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,600
A number of questions with all
of the coders of what we just

930
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,520
said, it strikes me that you are
probably familiar now with an

931
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,420
emerging network of people who
are working together with a

932
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,040
variety of different psychedelic
substances. Are you seeing

933
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:37,400
networks of consciousness such
that people are this is about to

934
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,420
sound really flaky, but a lot of
the push that I'm getting is to

935
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,060
do the work so that I can
actually connect with all of my

936
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,640
students in the dream in a way
that we're both fully aware of,

937
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,040
not I just get an email going. I
saw you in the dream last night.

938
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,080
You did this. I think, well,
that's really nice, but I have

939
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:56,260
no awareness of that that we
move to methods of human

940
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:01,440
networking that are similar to
but beyond the digital

941
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,800
networking that we just moved
into within the last 20 years.

942
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:07,320
Are you seeing anything
approaching that? Or, if not,

943
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,800
would you like to speak to what
is happening in terms of a

944
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,380
collective community, if
anything?

945
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:20,420
Chris Bache: Yeah, well, first I
want to own my limitations in

946
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,420
that even though I've published
this book, and even though I

947
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:27,140
speak at some conferences, I
don't speak at most psychedelic

948
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:31,400
conferences, because my work is
pretty radical, and the focus on

949
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,540
the psychedelic renaissance
right now is on therapy and

950
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,560
careful scientific studies
demonstrating The therapeutic

951
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,000
efficacy of psychedelics, and
that's perfectly fine. That's

952
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:47,500
that's where we need to be. But
there the movement is not yet

953
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,580
pushing the cosmological
territory that I've pushed in my

954
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,000
work.

955
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,100
Manda Scott: Yeah, it'll get
there. Must be somebody

956
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,040
somewhere that can't be that
just you did it well,

957
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:00,060
Chris Bache: like Bill Barnard,
and there are people, but. I

958
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:05,940
think a lot of it is still
underground at this point. So I

959
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:10,560
am aware of certain trends in
the Renaissance community and in

960
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,620
the psychedelic community, but I
I don't have a Catholic,

961
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:19,320
comprehensive breadth of access
to the what's happening. So I,

962
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:24,620
you know, I worked in isolation.
My work is unusually intense and

963
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:31,820
extreme, and I live basically a
pretty quiet life around that.

964
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,260
But what I do see, and there are
some people doing, as you're

965
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:43,180
describing, cultivating kind of
communities of paranormal

966
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:48,700
contact within the dream state,
extended dreaming, doing

967
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,800
different things. There are
people who are working in

968
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,940
meditation, trying to integrate
psychedelics into meditation

969
01:05:54,940 --> 01:06:01,680
circles. There's a lot. There's
a lot going on. A lot moving. I

970
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:07,440
think the internet is a physical
manifestation, in a sense, the

971
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,580
the hard wires of an emerging of
this emerging field

972
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:16,920
consciousness. So that even if
we don't accomplish these

973
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:20,360
networks psychically, we
certainly can. We're on a

974
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,960
network right now. We're, this
is a global network that we're

975
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:24,560
part of.

976
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:26,780
Manda Scott: It is but somebody
could pull a plug on it

977
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:32,240
tomorrow, if China or Russia or
somebody decides to just switch

978
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:36,620
it or monitor it such that it's
not safe to say anything outside

979
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:40,600
a certain narrow bandwidth, it
could vanish. The freedom that

980
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,260
we have just now is not, is not
a given, I would say, whereas if

981
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:47,680
we could talk to each other
without needing the internet, it

982
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,000
would be quite hard to interfere

983
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,940
Chris Bache: with that, it would
be great that the complication,

984
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:55,480
of course, is the clarity of the
transmission, the purity of the

985
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,900
transmission, because the
personal psyche throws up all

986
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,280
sorts of filters. Yeah.

987
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,620
Manda Scott: Ego gets in the
way. Basically, head, mind gets

988
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:10,680
in the way. Yeah, okay, I think
we never got to. Actually, you

989
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,500
said, I'll come to it later. Of
why I stopped. Did you feel that

990
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,320
you covered that? Did you want
to cover that? If not, is there

991
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,660
anything else that you feel we
could usefully cover in the time

992
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:21,080
that we go,

993
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:24,200
Chris Bache: that's actually
might be a good place to wrap up

994
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,580
some of the discussion, because
it's relevant to where we might

995
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:35,780
go. I stopped for two reasons. I
stopped first because my

996
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:41,680
physical system that my subtle
energy system, my Prana or qi

997
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:46,660
energy system was running so hot
after all these years of

998
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:52,900
practice that it was producing
certain physical symptoms that

999
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:58,000
was leaving me continually
physically uncomfortable, and I

1000
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,680
describe these in The book, but
basically I understood enough

1001
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,060
about chronic energy and
Ayurvedic medicine and to

1002
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:10,680
understand what was happening,
and I was just running too much

1003
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:15,420
energy. But that's not the major
reason I stopped. The major

1004
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:20,600
reason I stopped was heartache.
That is, it was getting

1005
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:25,820
increasingly difficult to come
back from the deep states of

1006
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:32,300
ecstatic Transcendence,
immersion in the divine fabric,

1007
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:38,120
to come out of that, back into
my time, space, reality. And

1008
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,020
there are beings. There are
great beings who are able to

1009
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:45,220
sustain that those
transcendental states in their

1010
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,540
time, space personality, they
are great masters, and truly,

1011
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,560
all honor to the great masters.
I'm not one of those beings.

1012
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:57,100
This is a path of temporary
immersion that's different than

1013
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,260
the path of contemplative
presence. So I can go into those

1014
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,260
states, but I have to come out
of them, and eventually coming

1015
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:12,420
back out just became too painful
of a separation, so I stopped,

1016
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:15,420
and I knew I would be stopping
for the rest of my life, because

1017
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,560
it takes years and years of
momentum to develop the energy

1018
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,260
to break into these high, high
energy states I could, if I did

1019
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,980
a massive dose of LSD right now,
I would not be able to go back

1020
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,880
to where I was working at the
end of my 20 year journey. Yeah,

1021
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:36,440
so I knew I was stopping for the
rest of my life, but it was

1022
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:41,920
important for me to stop, and I
had to first learn how to manage

1023
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,640
the heartache, and then to begin
the process of working the

1024
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:52,600
slower process of integrating
those living memories, actively

1025
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,440
living memories, into my
physical existence, which

1026
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,680
conversations like this actually
helped me do. So it's a very

1027
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:05,100
it's. Healing for me to talk
about these things with you so

1028
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:10,860
and the way that applies to
maybe some of your listeners, is

1029
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:15,360
to be careful about how much you
bite off in your sessions,

1030
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,040
because even if you're really
committed to conscientious

1031
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:23,600
integration, you can bite off
more than you can chew, or more

1032
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:29,840
than it's wise for you to chew.
So I think we can learn a lot

1033
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,660
from the contemplative
traditions. It's one of the

1034
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:36,620
advantages I had going into this
work. I was teaching courses in

1035
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,160
mysticism and meditation,
teaching courses in Shamanism

1036
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,260
and Buddhism. So I understood
the literature of mysticism. I

1037
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:49,060
understood the practices of
mysticism, the purification

1038
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:53,680
processes, and Ian and I tried
to use those processes in my own

1039
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:58,480
work. And there's a lot of
wisdom there. So it's it serves

1040
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:03,240
you to be well read, and I think
to recognize the limitations of

1041
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:09,240
any one incarnation. I think
that in some ways, I went to

1042
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,860
places that were so deep, it
will take me not just one

1043
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,460
incarnation, but multiple
incarnations, to truly integrate

1044
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:23,120
them. And by that, I mean being
able to manifest those levels of

1045
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:27,080
a consciousness inside my
physical consciousness,

1046
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:28,160
comfortably,

1047
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:31,460
Manda Scott: okay, right? Yes,
yes.

1048
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:35,900
Chris Bache: So I would
basically hate for anyone to try

1049
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,900
to do what I did and get into
trouble and hurt themselves.

1050
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,280
That would just break my heart.

1051
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,280
Manda Scott: Yeah, yeah. I think
we've, we've got the health

1052
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,180
warnings fairly clear on here.
If you're going to work with

1053
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,340
things, work with somebody who
knows really what they're doing.

1054
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:56,500
Me and my apprentice are working
to find people that we can pass

1055
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,740
people on to, because we get
emails saying I took substance

1056
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:02,220
X, and basically I'm having a
psychotic breakdown. What can I

1057
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:04,740
do? And we're shamanic
practitioners. Actually, it's

1058
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:07,920
not our field, so we're trying
to pass this on to people who

1059
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,440
can actually help, but they're
few and far between, because

1060
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,960
there's a lot more people who
think they can help than the

1061
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,120
ones who can actually help. So
take great care, find test your

1062
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,460
people out before you decide to
do something that is

1063
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,900
irreversible. I would say it's
really clear. And then do the

1064
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,080
work beforehand, and do the work
during, and do the work after

1065
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,520
after, to integrate and
integrate and integrate and do

1066
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,000
it because you're doing it in
service to life, and not because

1067
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,060
you're trying to make your ego
feel happy. Yeah, strikes me as

1068
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:40,520
a quite important one. Have I
missed anything out on the

1069
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,760
Chris Bache: health world? I
think it's great. And if you do

1070
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:46,480
your work well, one of the
things that happens is you lose

1071
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,160
all fear of death. You once, you
transition several times into

1072
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,540
that reality. You know, in your
bones, from your own experience,

1073
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,840
that death is not an end of
anything. It's simply an end of

1074
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,760
an incarnational cycle, and
there is absolutely nothing to

1075
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:06,180
fear about death. Death is
homecoming, all of the Hollywood

1076
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:09,720
bullshit that are thrown up at
us for, you know, dark places

1077
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,080
and demons and ghosts and all
this stuff, it's just nonsense.

1078
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,640
99% of people die and make a
transition into the light

1079
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,040
perfectly naturally and
comfortably. If you're afraid of

1080
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:27,200
dying, you've got your entire
metaphysics upside down. Death

1081
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,940
is homecoming. Death is the end
of your this matriculation. It's

1082
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,960
the harvesting of your life.
Birth should be mourned. Birth

1083
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,300
is where the work begins. It's
like being a freshman in

1084
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:43,300
college. It's hard. Graduation
is wonderful, right? And when

1085
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,960
you lose your fear of death, and
you begin to understand the

1086
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:54,880
deeper, meaningful challenges
which are embedded in our time

1087
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:01,320
space experiences, then the
whole, if you lose your fear of

1088
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,220
death, your whole game of life
changes, because death is what

1089
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,920
people fear more than anything
else. And if you don't have that

1090
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,700
fear, then you're you're going
into a different lifestyle, a

1091
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:15,300
different way of living, a more
joyful way of living.

1092
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:20,099
Manda Scott: Yes, yes. Thank
you. Thank you. That feels to

1093
01:14:20,099 --> 01:14:23,419
me, a fantastic place to end.
Does that feel good to you? It

1094
01:14:23,419 --> 01:14:27,259
feels good to me. All right, in
that case, Chris, thank you so

1095
01:14:27,259 --> 01:14:29,659
much for coming on to the
accidental gold podcast. This

1096
01:14:29,659 --> 01:14:33,559
has been an absolute delight. I
have enjoyed every moment, and I

1097
01:14:33,559 --> 01:14:35,599
think what a way to start the
year.

1098
01:14:35,659 --> 01:14:38,299
Chris Bache: Thank you. Thank
you, Amanda, and thank you for

1099
01:14:38,299 --> 01:14:41,499
your work. We need all of the
awareness that we can bring to

1100
01:14:41,499 --> 01:14:44,559
ourselves, and you are certainly
bringing awareness to many

1101
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:45,819
people. Thank you. You.

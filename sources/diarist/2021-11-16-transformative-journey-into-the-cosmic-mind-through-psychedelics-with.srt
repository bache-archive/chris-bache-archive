1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,300
Vanese McNeill: Hello everybody.
This is vannice McNeil from

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,220
MAGICAL EGYPT, live. And today I
have a very special guest with

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,620
me. Chris is one of my favorite
people in the entire world. I

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,020
think that he has some of the
most important knowledge to

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,620
share with us, as well as
wisdom, and I'm also now

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,280
declaring that he's a prophet as
well. So welcome, Chris,

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,120
Chris Bache: happiness. I don't
know about the Prophet part, but

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,540
okay,

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,260
Vanese McNeill: well, sweetie, I
have to say things have got

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,820
interesting since we've talked
last, right?

11
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:48,279
Chris Bache: Yeah, yeah, the
turbulence of this century is

12
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:51,939
certainly increasing, isn't it?

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,040
Vanese McNeill: It is indeed, my
dear. It is indeed, but it is

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,040
necessary, if I understand you
correctly.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,120
Unknown: Well, you know, as I've
written about in my book LSD, in

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,520
the mind of the universe,
there's a chapter on the birth

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,960
of the future human, where I
summarize all the visions that I

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,800
was given through many years of
doing the deep psychedelic work

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,500
that I did. And I don't know
whether it is necessary, but the

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,020
vision simply showed me that
humanity was coming into this

21
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,340
period of profound spiritual
awakening, a major spiritual

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,600
turning point, a tipping point,
a bifurcation point that would

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,960
really change human history. But
then it also showed me that

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,140
going into this period, we were
going to be going through a

25
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,760
period of tremendous suffering,
a falling apart, an unraveling

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,280
of civilization as we've known
it, and that. But coming through

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,000
this, we would be changed
profoundly. We would tap into

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,260
levels of our core and actualize
potentials. That were really

29
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,420
have been realized only by
relatively few in history, but

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,740
now must be realized by the
entire population, a shift in

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,580
the collective psyche, not
simply our personal psyche. Now,

32
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,640
whether this is the suffering is
inevitable or meant to be or

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,700
something, I don't know. I only
report the visions that it's

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,540
going to be there, but it's not
going to be terminal. It's not

35
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,400
going to be extinction. It's
actually labor, and labor

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
results in a birth, and a new
birth is coming for the human

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,600
family. I

38
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,720
Vanese McNeill: mmm and labor,
why it's not fun is necessary

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:56,500
for this birth. And I also
believe that holding our hands

40
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,720
through this process, and that's
why I'm talking to you today, I

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,780
can see I'm breaking up. Am I
breaking up? My dear, can you

42
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:03,960
hear

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,180
Chris Bache: my end? Am I into I
hear you now?

44
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,520
Vanese McNeill: Okay, great. So
to the end of holding our hands

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,620
through this process, I would
love for you to share with us

46
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,640
all today a little bit about the
course that you have coming up.

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,740
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to share the screen. All

48
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:36,080
right, okay, okay, so tell us a
little bit about this wonderful

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,860
Chris Bache: well, you're
breaking up a little bit, but

50
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm going to assume that I can
just go ahead and talk now. You

51
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:54,280
know, I spent, after doing this
deep LSD journey for 20 years, I

52
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,420
spent another 20 years thinking
about my experiences, digesting

53
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,680
them, processing them, and
eventually writing down the

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,680
story of this journey in my
book, LSD in the mind of the

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,200
universe, or as I prefer to call
it, diamonds from heaven. And

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,520
now that this book has been out
about a year and a half, I'm now

57
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,540
beginning have been invited to
roll out this course with the

58
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,880
shift network, where we spend
seven weeks on the material

59
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,780
covered in the book. Everybody
who signs up for the course will

60
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,520
receive a free e copy of the
book so that they can read the

61
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,300
chapters as we go through them,
week by week through the course.

62
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,120
It's basically simply, I'm
inviting people to join me in

63
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,160
this journey to through our
conversations, through my talks,

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,300
through the Q, amp a, through
some visualization exercises,

65
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,300
inviting people to come with me
on this long journey spiraling

66
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,320
deeper and deeper into the
universe. Now I don't think my

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,120
experience. Experiences are
special or unique in this way,

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,140
many of us have deep psychedelic
experiences. I've tried to put a

69
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,640
lot of energy into clarifying
the concepts involved, and now

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,600
these experiences that the
course is built around are not

71
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,780
primarily personal. When I wrote
the book, I dropped out, a lot

72
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,800
of my personal experiences.
Tried to focus on the

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,520
experiences that were universal,
that were really addressing the

74
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,960
human family as a whole, are the
deep structure of the universe

75
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,300
as a whole, not my own personal
little garden of it. So in this

76
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,740
discussion, we go in layer by
layer, stage by stage, following

77
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,060
the rhythm of the journey
itself, the cycles of death and

78
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,800
rebirth, a death at one level of
reality followed by a birth in

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,280
another level of reality,
acclimating to this new level of

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,240
reality, learning the rules
they're receiving teachings.

81
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,320
There another round of death and
rebirth a couple of years later,

82
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,700
entering a new level of reality,
the same thing, repeating

83
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,880
itself, learning what's
happening there, learning what's

84
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,260
going on. And my hope is that by
taking this journey with me,

85
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,420
will generate a lot of value in
our conversation, in our

86
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,100
discussion, in the clarification
we can bring to really thorny

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,040
issues about why life is the way
it is, what is the purpose and

88
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,420
goal of our existence? And I
know it sounds grandiose to sort

89
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,680
of bring those categories in,
but I think if we my basic

90
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,400
understanding of psychedelics is
that it allows us to enter into

91
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,320
deeper communion with the
intelligence of the universe,

92
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,880
and that when we do that, the
universe will speak to us, it

93
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,180
will teach us, it will take us
in. It'll it will give us a

94
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,660
sense of the larger landscape.
And so I don't think that

95
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,980
anything I'm sharing is in any
way unique. I think it shows up

96
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,360
in the work of other psychedelic
assists Psychonauts. It shows up

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,440
in Stan grofs work. It's just
laid out in the very carefully,

98
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,720
man careful manner, and it allow
us to discuss some deep topics

99
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,860
that are you don't find
discussed very much. So that's

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,900
that's my hope for the course,
that's the agenda.

101
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,200
Vanese McNeill: I think it
sounds amazing, and I am very

102
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,080
blessed to have kind of a cheat
sheet here. But before we

103
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,860
actually go into that, I think
your point is is very important.

104
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,620
I think that for those who have
not read Chris's books or or at

105
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,800
least or possibly even not seen
a video, Chris's journey took

106
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,540
him through a personal journey,
a kind of expanded into

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,620
masculinity, or the male
journey, expanded into a human

108
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,060
journey, and the expansion just
kept going on. And so for most

109
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,260
of us, we

110
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,520
Chris Bache: you're breaking up,
back up and start again. For

111
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,660
most of us,

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,680
Vanese McNeill: oh, for most of
us, we barely get out of our

113
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,260
personal journey. I am so sorry
that this is so unstable,

114
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,560
sweetie. Why don't you give us a
taste, because you're not

115
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,800
breaking up. Give us a little
sneak peek.

116
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,380
Chris Bache: Well, we're going
to start with the first module.

117
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,200
There's seven modules. The first
module is going to be on

118
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,920
methodology. We really I'm going
to lay out the method, answer

119
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,620
people's questions, address
their misgivings about

120
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,160
psychedelics, explain what
psychedelics do and don't do,

121
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,580
and in specifically address the
particular protocol, which I use

122
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,420
because it was an extreme
protocol, a protocol that I

123
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,960
don't recommend, that others
adopt today. I would be gentler

124
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,320
if I were doing it again, but
it's an extreme protocol, and we

125
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
need to really address the
method as we move into then we

126
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,920
move into what happened when you
follow this method. The second

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,500
module is going to be on the
crossing the boundary of birth

128
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,420
and death, a letting go of our
egoic identity, time, space

129
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,120
identity, a process of
purification which culminates in

130
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,300
ego, death or the destruction of
the now, the destruction of the

131
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,960
consciousness that holds our
experience inside time and

132
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,660
space. And when I say
destruction, I don't mean that

133
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:38,480
we're going to permanently
damage the ego, but basically,

134
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,420
we have to allow the ego to fall
aside if our consciousness is

135
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,620
going to enter into dimensions
of the cosmos which are larger

136
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,920
than time and space and are
larger than our historical

137
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,780
experience of time and space. So
we talk about ego death in this

138
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,920
context, and then in that same
module, I'll be talking about.

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,420
The ocean of suffering work,
because I found that in my

140
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,740
experiences, at least working
with very high doses of LSD,

141
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,780
after I went through ego death,
I began to get in, drawn into

142
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,080
another round of purification of
dying. And it was not personal.

143
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,360
It was collective. It opened up
into 1000s and 10s of 1000s,

144
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,860
hundreds of 1000s of human
beings and 1000s of years of

145
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,300
time, it became a fundamental
riddle for me. It took me years

146
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,480
to figure out what was
happening, and the conclusion I

147
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,860
eventually came to is that this
purification process was not

148
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,140
aimed at my personal
transformation, but rather the

149
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,000
universe was using my sessions
to bring about a healing of some

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,040
aspect of the collective psyche,
some way of letting the wounds

151
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,160
of history, all the wars and all
the terrible things we've done

152
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,620
to each other and we've
experienced together droughts

153
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,480
and famines, that these wounds
still live within the collective

154
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,660
psyche, and somehow, by opening
up to these living memories in

155
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,480
my sessions, these these painful
memories, were being lifted from

156
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,740
the collective psyche. So we're
be talking about that, looking

157
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,240
at the material, looking at the
concepts that are involved. So

158
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,660
that takes us up to module two.
In module three, we then follow

159
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:35,240
the process into a deeper level
of reality, into archetypal

160
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,720
reality, into what I've
differentiate my experiences

161
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,500
there in two levels, which you
might call the Jung Ian level

162
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,880
and the Platonic level. The
lower subtle level is the kind

163
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,960
of quasi Jung Ian level where I
had experiences of the human

164
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,080
family as a unified single
being, similar to Jung's concept

165
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,000
of the collective unconscious,
that all of our minds were part

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,800
were fractal components in a
single mind of the human

167
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,940
species. Even our bodies were
cells within the body of the

168
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,420
human species. How I handled my
diseases had an impact on how

169
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,640
the human family was learning
and handling its diseases, how I

170
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,540
handled my pain, psychological
pain, was related to how the

171
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,480
human species was being able to
hand handle its pain. So this at

172
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,400
the and I say quasi Jung Ian,
because I didn't engage any of

173
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,560
the archetypes that Jung talks
about, wise old man, wise old

174
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,160
woman. But it was this
experience of over and over

175
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,380
again, focusing on the one human
family, then at a higher level,

176
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,820
moving into what I would call
the quasi platonic level,

177
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,860
engaging archetypes that were so
far removed from time and space,

178
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,920
so far beyond any our any
conventional categories, that I

179
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,880
literally could not wrap my mind
around them. I could not see

180
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,600
them as they were in and of
themselves, but I knew I was

181
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,400
engaging vast cosmic forces that
were responsible for creating

182
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,860
the conditions inside time and
space, even time and space

183
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,580
itself. I call this a quasi
platonic level, because Plato

184
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,600
envision the archetypes as
eternal ideas in the mind of an

185
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,920
unchanging God. That's not how I
experience these beings. I

186
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,880
experience them as vast, huge,
living, dynamic beings that

187
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,240
lived in a different order of
time and a different order of

188
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,240
space than we do inside time and
space. So after spending then

189
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,040
two years or so exploring this
reality, I went through yet

190
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,960
another death and rebirth, and
we go into the fourth module,

191
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,620
where I think I've got the
modules listed right here,

192
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,020
oneness, fundamental, the
blessings of oneness, of moving

193
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:15,300
into causal reality, beyond
archetype of reality, and in

194
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,120
this level of reality, the world
lives and breathes This one. As

195
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,840
Plotinus says, The World
breathes this one. All the

196
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,620
components of the world are
there, but the fundamental

197
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,140
experiences, experiencing the
world as a unified reality, all

198
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,880
of its life forms, cells within
this unified reality, all the

199
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,120
galaxies, cells within this
unified reality, experiencing

200
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,380
emptiness of self, what the
Buddhists call Shunyata, to

201
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,360
experience being alive in a
world, but absolutely no self in

202
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,260
me, no separate self, no
separate self in any part of

203
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,560
reality, experiencing the primal
void ex. Experiencing an ocean

204
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,160
of cosmic love pouring into me
just multiple manifestations of

205
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,980
of oneness, permutations of
oneness, going still deeper,

206
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,440
another round of death and
rebirth entering into the

207
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,420
diamond Luminosity material, the
diamond Luminosity is what I use

208
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,280
as a term. I use to refer to a
state of consciousness that I

209
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,840
entered into in the last five
years of my work, extremely

210
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,780
clear. The most striking
characteristic is, first, it's

211
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,940
just pure light, all light,
realm of pure light and clear,

212
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,340
clear, beyond imagination, just
clear, clear, phenomenally

213
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:54,400
clear. Where the joy came, not
from anything that happened in

214
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,060
this state or from anything I
experienced in this state, but

215
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,540
the very state itself, the
clarity and of this state, the

216
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,820
absolute freedom, the sheer
bliss of the freedom in this

217
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,280
condition, I think this is what,
as a professor of religious

218
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,340
studies, the closest thing I've
been able to find to this

219
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,220
condition is What Buddhism calls
Dharmakaya. In Buddhism, there

220
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,240
are three kayas, Dharmakaya,
sambhogakaya, Nirvana, Kaya,

221
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,440
three different dimensions of
reality. Dharmakaya is the

222
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,540
deepest. It's called the clear
light of absolute reality. It is

223
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,440
the light out of which the Big
Bang emerges. So in the last

224
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,260
five years of my journey, 26
sessions, I entered this reality

225
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:53,260
four times when I touched it.
The first time, it was so

226
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:59,260
powerful and it was so it filled
me with so much joy and ecstasy

227
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,840
that I completely lost interest
in any of the earlier levels of

228
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,000
reality that I had explored. I
lost interest in personal and

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,920
collective and archetypal, even
the bliss of causal level

230
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,120
reality. This was different.
This was a higher order. It took

231
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,820
me about a year of very intense
work, lots of purification

232
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,900
before I was able to go back
into this deeper state of

233
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,640
reality, and I went back into it
over four years, only four

234
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,400
times. The next module has to do
with the birth of the future

235
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,520
human, which we mentioned before
that it is a chapter where I

236
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,180
gather together years of
visionary experiences that I was

237
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,640
given about where humanity is in
its evolution, about the turning

238
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,380
point we have come to my sense
is that we can no longer afford

239
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,860
to live on this planet As a
species of egos that emphasize

240
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,120
our separate, private existence,
where some can lose and some can

241
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,380
win. We need to grow up. We need
to grow up into our next

242
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,420
evolutionary expression.

243
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,620
Over and over again, I was shown
these visions that this is

244
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,500
what's happening. Nature is
taking us through this. We are

245
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,820
going through a tremendous
pressure cooker. We're going

246
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,660
through a transformation that
will result in the birth, not

247
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,720
simply of a higher civilization
or a more ecologically in tune

248
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,560
economy, but literally this. We
are going through a series of

249
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,100
crises that we're going to shift
the architecture of the

250
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,900
collective psyche, so that all
human beings born after we go

251
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,520
through this process will be
born in the context and be

252
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,680
operating in the context of a
new collective psyche, of a

253
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,780
different collective psyche, a
more evolved collective psyche

254
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,760
for our species, the birth of
the future human, which I also

255
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,720
conceptualize as the birth of
the diamond soul. I think

256
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,680
reincarnation has been taking us
toward this point for 1000s and

257
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,440
1000s of years. Gestation is
long. Birth labor is quick. The

258
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,700
gestation which has been
developing within us, has been

259
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,720
developing through death and
rebirth, reincarnation, dying

260
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,500
and being reborn, dying and
being reborn, incremental gains,

261
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,800
incremental gains as we grow.
But there comes a time when the

262
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,320
soul, which holds all of our
experiences from all of our

263
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,440
lives, which is our natural
state of consciousness when we

264
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,880
die, and the ego, which is the
small consciousness we're born

265
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,520
into when we incarnate, back and
forth between ego and soul, ego

266
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,920
and soul, there comes a point
where sooner or later, the soul.

267
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,080
So the consciousness, which
holds all our of our memories,

268
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:12,240
fuses and integrates into one
and becomes conscious inside

269
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,200
time and space, not outside time
and space in the pure,

270
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,980
beautiful, pure paradise or in
the garden or in the heavenly

271
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:26,780
realms, but awakens inside time
and space. And this is what I

272
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,960
call the birth of the diamond
soul. When this happened to me

273
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,880
in my sessions, all my former
lives came together, they fused,

274
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,140
and they were catapulted. I was
catapulted far beyond my

275
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,420
ordinary capacities, and I think
this is simply what's happening

276
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,260
to the entire human species. I
was given the gift of getting a

277
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,000
taste of what's in the
evolutionary works for all of

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,560
us. We are coming into a hard
labor. We're coming into a time

279
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,200
of unraveling. We're coming into
a very, very difficult time. But

280
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,200
my experiences in my sessions is
that we come through this human

281
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,540
beings do not go extinct, but we
give birth to a divine child. We

282
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,380
give birth to the future human,
to the birth of the diamond soul

283
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:24,020
in history. The last module in
the course is on coming off the

284
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,040
mountain. It's about
integration. It's about how do

285
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,080
you integrate such extreme
experiences? Now, as long as

286
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,280
we're working about in a
therapeutic model, then we have

287
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,940
therapeutic models for how to
integrate the various content

288
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,300
that emerges in our on from our
unconscious when we're working

289
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,560
at the level of the personal
psyche. If we go deeper and

290
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,100
begin to experience life after
death and begin to experience

291
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,920
the connective tissue, the
intelligence of the connective

292
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,900
tissue of life, we have
spiritual models for integrating

293
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:07,080
and absorbing these experiences,
but when we go very, very deep

294
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,200
into the fabric of existence,
when we go repeatedly outside of

295
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,440
space and time, when we go deep
into the archetypal fabric, deep

296
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,480
into the light which is the
light that underpins all of

297
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,380
reality. How are those
experiences being integrated by

298
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,300
us? Then, what does integration
even mean in this context? How

299
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:38,780
can a finite being integrate
infinite experiences or

300
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,700
experiences of infinity? How
does a time bound being

301
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,560
integrated experiences of
eternity or deep time? So that's

302
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,460
what we're going to be looking
at at the last module we'll be

303
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,340
looking at the challenges of
integrating, not just

304
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,480
integrating individual sessions,
but integrating an entire

305
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,860
journey that explores deep,
Non-ordinary states of

306
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,540
consciousness year after year
after year. Personally, I don't

307
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,920
think we have begun to map what
these deep experiences are doing

308
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,940
to us. I don't think we've
really begun to understand fully

309
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,840
the opportunities that they're
giving us and also the

310
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,820
challenges, the hardships they
bring to us in order to, you

311
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,500
know, come back into time and
space after such glorious

312
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,400
adventures outside of time and
space. So that's the kind of

313
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,460
that's the trajectory of the
course, in a nutshell.

314
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,660
Vanese McNeill: So, Chris, I'm
going to leave my microphone

315
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,340
off, I mean my camera off, as it
might help my interactivity,

316
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:49,600
right? So, sweetie, do you have
a sense of once we integrate the

317
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,920
soul?

318
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,360
Chris Bache: Say again, you're
breaking up once we integrate

319
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,860
the soul function,

320
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,740
Vanese McNeill: how do we act?
What do we look like? Do you

321
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,940
have a sense of that?

322
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,820
Chris Bache: Well, I think we
act like old ones. I think what

323
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,100
we're doing is growing up. We've
we see the prototypes in Jesus

324
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,660
and Muhammad and the Buddha in
some of the great saints of

325
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:29,000
history, whose natural horizons
are so large, whose compassion

326
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,880
is so deep, whose ability to
download information from cosmic

327
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,100
mind is so augmented. And I
think it will look something

328
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,760
like that. It will look like an
older human being, a being who

329
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,800
is steeped in time, who carries
the knowledge of 1000s of

330
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,340
incarnations, just as our ego
carries the knowledge of one

331
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,300
incarnation. I don't think it'll
be a science fiction. Action,

332
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,560
exotic looking human being
growing another set of fingers

333
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,840
or getting a bigger skull. I
think we are it will bring about

334
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,260
deep metabolic changes in our in
our body, but we'll register it

335
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,400
will register first as a
profound series of psychological

336
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,500
changes, changes in our heart.
We will enter into what I

337
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,520
sometimes call the one heart,
the one heart of the human

338
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,360
family, the one heart of the
planet. We will enter into

339
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,740
deeper communion with the mind
of creation, the mind that's

340
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,140
been generating this extra
ordinary Galaxy this planet, all

341
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,700
the life on this planet will be
able to enter into communion and

342
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,980
download information from this
intelligence more easily than we

343
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,320
can do it today. I think this,
this new human being will

344
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,480
actually live in the body
differently and experience their

345
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,340
senses differently. One of the
last gifts I was given on my

346
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,360
journey, actually was the very
last gift given on my last

347
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,700
psychedelic journey, was what I
call diamond vision. My vision

348
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,080
suddenly I was in a condition
five hours into the session,

349
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,880
late in the wind down stage of
the session where my vision was

350
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,840
100 times more acute than it
normally is, where I could see

351
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,820
levels, ingredients of color,
edges of detail, much, much more

352
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,840
fine than I was ever able to see
before. And after about 10

353
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,540
minutes, it disappeared. It
stopped. And it was at that

354
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:45,040
point that I began to realize I
was had been given the gift of

355
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,420
seeing through the eyes of the
future human. We have a tendency

356
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:55,600
to think of our perceptual our
senses as kind of mechanical,

357
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,800
neurologically generated, but I
don't think that's really the

358
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,620
case. Our system certainly uses
our physiology, but as our

359
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:11,280
consciousness gets stronger and
bigger and older, it brings out

360
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,080
deeper and more refined senses,
a deeper form of vision, a

361
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,360
deeper form of hearing, a deeper
form of testing and sensing our

362
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,580
physical body. So I think that
the future human is not simply a

363
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,020
human with a healed heart and an
open heart, and not simply a

364
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,000
human being with an open and
deeper mental capacity, but as

365
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,860
somebody who lives in a deeper
sensory experience, a more

366
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,380
satisfying sensory experience in
their body with all the hills,

367
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,300
or a long, dark history healed
in the body, emotionally,

368
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,940
psychologically and physically.
Yeah, so that's, that's what I

369
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,040
think the future human will be
like. It'll be like a grown up

370
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,200
version of ourselves, the soul

371
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,880
Vanese McNeill: that's
beautiful, Chris, that actually

372
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,040
makes a lot of sense to me. You,
as you pointed out these sci fi

373
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,440
vision of humans, and when you
say also the collective soul, my

374
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,400
mind jumps to the Borg or
something like that on Star

375
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,600
Trek, which does not appear
appealing to me at all. This,

376
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:32,120
yeah, this vision is, is very,
very beautiful. I was reading a

377
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,760
book last night that was talking
about the relationship between

378
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:44,620
sleeping and death. And what
occurred to me is that there is

379
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:52,780
a Mandelbrot type set of
magnification between the state

380
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:59,020
of dreaming and dying and then
the series of dyings that you

381
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:05,520
went through on this journey.
And just like dreaming is a

382
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:12,900
state very much akin to death,
and being alive in the or being

383
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:18,240
awake in the daytime is very
much akin to being alive in a

384
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:25,700
life you just progressed up into
the bigger Mandelbrot sections

385
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,880
of that process, right dying
every time, on a different layer

386
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,720
and a higher register, if you
will. And as a result of that,

387
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,060
being able to kind of access
these larger perspectives. And I

388
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,620
think that one of the fact that
you did that for us is

389
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:57,460
invaluable, because in a normal
waking state with everything

390
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,540
that is going on in the world,
it's very, very hard to. Be in

391
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:06,120
touch with your intuition at
all, let alone having a broader

392
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,360
state of consciousness. And
that's why I think it's very

393
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,680
important for people. And yes,
look, it is your journey and

394
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,360
filtered through your senses and
your experiences. But

395
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,260
fundamentally, there is very,
very precious information that

396
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,680
you have died for and brought
back for us. And if you are

397
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,240
going to share one of those for
the people today who are kind

398
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,480
of, you know, living like out of
all the different levels that

399
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,460
you went through, what a piece
of information would be most

400
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,020
helpful for us today with what
seems to be the bifurcation of

401
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,160
people into red people and blue
people and Vax people and unvax

402
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,480
people and all of these kinds of
things, yeah, what can help us

403
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,440
most today?

404
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,740
Chris Bache: Yeah, good
question. I don't know whether

405
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,160
there's I can think of one thing
that would help us most today,

406
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,460
but so let me just ramble a
little bit and see if we can

407
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,360
move towards something like
that. First, let me mention that

408
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,460
I think this is a personal
journey, and I own it. I accept

409
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,900
the personal nature of the
journey. It's very but I think

410
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,140
it's what happens in one one
serious psychedelic work is

411
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,120
something like the following, my
experiences that consciousness

412
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,900
is an infinite ocean, that
there's an infinite ocean of

413
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,960
consciousness, and my mind acts
as a seed catalyst that

414
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,560
catalyzes a certain set of
experiences out of the infinite

415
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,240
potential of this larger
consciousness. Now, so in a

416
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,140
sense, my experiences in the
psychedelic state are always

417
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,000
participatory. They're always
interactive. My being evoked

418
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,020
certain sets of experiences. It
doesn't mean that I'm simply

419
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,880
reading my own mind in these
experiences, but my being

420
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,000
catalyzes a certain set of
experiences from the infinite

421
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,560
mind. But as I internalize those
experiences, as I let them

422
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,860
change me, as I let them purify
me, as I let them kill me allow

423
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,780
myself to die as I allow myself
to be purified at deeper and

424
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,160
deeper levels. What happens is
the seed catalyst of my mind is

425
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,360
changed, so that when I go into
psychedelic space, the next

426
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,620
time, my mind is a little
different than it was before,

427
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:42,040
and it catalyzes a still deeper
response from the cosmic, the

428
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,300
infinite mind of the universe.
And if you keep this up many,

429
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,820
many years, this very much
matches the experience that the

430
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,540
more you allow yourself to be
purified, the more you allow

431
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,680
yourself to let go of your old
ways of thinking and old ways of

432
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,420
feeling and just go with it.
Just allow yourself to be

433
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,520
solved, to be dissolved into the
winds of the world that the

434
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,620
universe can show you more
because you you are capable of

435
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,020
receiving more because you've
emptied out your being and have

436
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:25,160
been made yourself into a
receptacle. I don't think, I

437
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,480
think the infinite consciousness
is truly that an infinite

438
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,380
consciousness. So even though
there were many homecomings, and

439
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,760
even though there were many,
many deeply soul satisfying

440
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,460
experiences, I couldn't imagine
being more satisfied. I also had

441
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,080
experiences which showed me that
it is truly an infinite world

442
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,440
that I was entering and I would
never be able to get to the end

443
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,880
of it. I could not get to the
end of this reality. It was just

444
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,680
too vast, and I was too small,
even using this very accelerated

445
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:06,360
process. So from this journey, I
bring back experiences that were

446
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,680
given to me by this larger
intelligence, which over the

447
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,420
years, it became clear I was
being given these visions and

448
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,600
trust these experiences and
trust they weren't being given

449
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,420
to me privately, but they were
being given to me so that there

450
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,500
would come a time when I could
do my job as a teacher, just as

451
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,160
I'm an academic, you know, I'm a
philosopher of religion, to

452
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,180
share them with other people, so
that these visions, to the

453
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,540
extent that they truly reflect
universal truths, people would

454
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,760
recognize those universal truths
and they they would find ways of

455
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,100
integrating them into their own
life. So excuse me again. Didn't

456
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,940
turn off my ping

457
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,500
Vanese McNeill: on my phone.
That's okay. Neither did I.

458
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:53,920
Darling.

459
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,200
Chris Bache: So in terms of what
would be useful to people, a

460
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,200
number of things. That come
forward. One of them is to trust

461
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,040
the intelligence of the
universe, to trust the wisdom

462
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,480
that is alive and operating in
the universe. We are taught that

463
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,040
the universe came about by
chance, that that it evolves by

464
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,220
random mutation, screened by
brutal survival of the fittest.

465
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,180
That's not an accurate
reflection of my psychedelic

466
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,720
experience at all. My
experiences is that we are

467
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,740
everywhere, surrounded by orders
and orders and magnitudes of

468
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,580
intelligence, that when you go
deeper into the universe, you're

469
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,260
entering into more and more and
more awareness, more

470
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,120
consciousness, more intelligence
than we generally experience

471
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:52,180
inside time and space, but to
trust the universe, to trust the

472
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,720
universe that has created the
conditions of reincarnation,

473
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,320
where we choose our lives, we
choose the conditions In which

474
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,600
we enter into, even the
difficult ones we we choose

475
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,740
these things to understand
reincarnation, not simply as a

476
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:13,980
personal soul story, but a
collective soul story, a human

477
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,300
family soul story that
incarnates intelligently

478
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:23,600
generation after generation as
we grow as a human family, to

479
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,320
feel that intelligence, to
recognize the intelligence how

480
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,160
it works, to recognize the
intelligence of how the human

481
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,140
family is now being catalyzed
all of us together to bring

482
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,740
forward a deeper form of
functioning, a deeper way of

483
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:45,520
being human on this planet, if
there were maybe only one thing,

484
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,580
if I were to point to one thing
that I wish I could give people,

485
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,220
it would be to lose their fear
of death. I wish I could reach

486
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,740
into my heart and give you this
absolute freedom of any fear of

487
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,900
death. Because if you fear
death, you've got your cosmology

488
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,120
all upside down. If you're
afraid of dying, then you don't

489
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,560
understand that the hard work is
done inside time and space. The

490
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,000
really hard work is done here.
When we die, it's graduation.

491
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,500
When we die, it's it's
homecoming. When we die, it's

492
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:26,360
recess. We get this tremendous
joy. We have so many Hollywood

493
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,360
narratives about the spooky
things that happen to us when we

494
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,480
die, and they're they're just
nonsense. They're just

495
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,680
ridiculous. When you, when you
experience death yourself, when

496
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,280
you are near a person who
studies near death episode

497
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,500
research, and you talk to people
who have truly died and have

498
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,920
come back to life, or who have
been nearly dead and come back

499
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,000
to tell about it. Or when you go
to the shamanic traditions where

500
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,880
death and rebirth is an
understanding, is a deep

501
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,660
understanding what happens in
one's psychedelic sessions when

502
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,180
you've gone through death, many
times, you lose all fear of

503
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,480
dying, because you know from
your own personal experience

504
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,300
that death is simply a
transition, and it's a

505
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,520
transition to a happier place, a
finer place, a place what you

506
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,840
will eventually choose to return
into time space again, because

507
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,000
of the Great value of time and
space, but death is absolutely

508
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,880
nothing to fear. So a
combination of the the wisdom of

509
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,920
the universe, the genius of the
universe, the way that the cycle

510
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,660
of life takes us in and out of
death, many, many times, and in

511
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,700
and out of rebirth, many, many
times, and that there is purpose

512
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,100
in this, there is design in
this. The universe is creating a

513
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,120
species, the likes of which we
haven't even begun to imagine.

514
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,940
It has been billions of years in
the making, and it will continue

515
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,820
to be made for billions of years
more every time we think we can

516
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,600
do it better. If we were God, we
would have designed the world a

517
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,440
little better. We would have
eliminated this or eliminated

518
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,340
that. I think, well, that means
that you know where we're going,

519
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:19,380
and we don't. I think we're just
get glimpses. Even in our deep

520
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,660
visionary states, we get
glimpses of what is being built.

521
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,640
And I think we're going to see
in this century some early signs

522
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,420
of what is being built in
history, in the future, human,

523
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,460
Vanese McNeill: sweet, I can't
agree with you more. And I

524
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:43,900
remember when I was a student
and came up against the great

525
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,420
saints or the great sages that
would choose death rather than

526
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,600
compromising their idea or their
belief, they would literally go

527
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,680
and be burned at the stake
because the importance of that

528
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,980
idea. Idea was so strong, and
they have remained through

529
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:12,060
history as being people whose
messages still resound right in

530
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:18,300
our in our day to day lives. And
what's been very evident to me

531
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,540
is that with this virus that has
occurred that the populace on

532
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:32,540
mass remains very much in a
state of fear of death. And I

533
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:39,800
wonder how an individual that
hasn't been on your journey is

534
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:45,940
able to arrive at that state
without undergoing what you've

535
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,360
taken or what you've gone
through. How do I get where you

536
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,560
are without having 72 doses of
LSD?

537
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,640
Unknown: A number of ways, I
think, first of all, read books,

538
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,300
there are wonderful, wonderful,
very well researched studies of

539
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:14,700
people who have died or who have
nearly died. And when people

540
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,260
begin to read the near death
episode literature, it changes.

541
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,180
I've taught this for decades to
my students at the university.

542
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,920
And when you read the near death
episode literature, it changes

543
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,740
completely how you experience
the or how you anticipate death.

544
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,820
Another body of literature is
the reincarnation literature.

545
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,100
The evidence, which I find is
absolutely, empirically,

546
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,280
overwhelmingly good evidence for
reincarnation. And once again,

547
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,900
it is if there, if we
reincarnate, if there is a mind

548
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,260
which moves through one
incarnation after another in

549
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,840
some way, then it basically
takes away the fear of dying.

550
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,040
You understand that death is not
the end. It's simply the end of

551
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:10,200
one half of a cycle. The cycle
goes from birth to birth, or

552
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,440
death to death, let's say birth
to birth. Halfway through that

553
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,520
cycle, there is death, but there
is activity on the other side

554
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,160
after death, which brings us
back into birth again. We can

555
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,700
study that. Literature, the past
life therapy. Literature, when

556
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:31,220
people actively encounter their
former lives in order to heal

557
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,000
those former lives, the near
death episode. Literature, the

558
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,860
reincarnation literature, it
just when you put together all

559
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,920
these bodies of information
intellectually that should

560
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:51,460
assuage our fear of dying. And
then I think, to spend time,

561
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,980
either in books or tapes or in
person with people who have gone

562
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,020
through whatever spiritual
practice they've used that has

563
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,820
truly dissolved their fear of
dying, to be to spend time with

564
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,840
them, because this is something.
It's not magical, you know, it's

565
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:17,820
not super duper supernatural.
It's simply a kind of opening to

566
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,640
a larger horizon where certain
things don't frighten you

567
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,180
anymore, and it's something
which can be learned, it can be

568
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,980
transmitted from one person to
another, so that it becomes kind

569
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:37,820
of a shared community value. So
I certainly don't think you need

570
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,820
to do what I've done in order to
awaken this sense of

571
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,700
fearlessness confronting life,

572
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,520
Vanese McNeill: that actually
makes a lot of sense, sweetie.

573
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,880
Yes, I agree with you. I mean, I
am rather au fait with the

574
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,880
literature, and it does. I mean,
there is overwhelming evidence

575
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,320
out there. You have a book
Dolores, Cannon's done so much

576
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,080
work on it. There's a lot of
really, really good researchers

577
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,260
that have reported on this. And
then the drew the, I think it's

578
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:15,360
the Druze, which is a culture in
the Middle East where the

579
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,200
children that have been,
unfortunately, they've passed

580
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,480
away as a result of some
traumatic experience, come back

581
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,460
very quickly, and can literally
go and identify their ex wives

582
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,540
or their children. I mean,
that's uncanny, yeah.

583
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,440
Unknown: Ian Stevenson's work, I
think, is a game changer. He

584
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,560
really is the Charles Darwin of
reincarnation. He's given us

585
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:48,100
sufficient hunt cases. Children
have not only continuity of

586
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,940
memory, they can recognize
people from the circumstances of

587
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,900
the previous life. They know
intimate details of the previous

588
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,920
personalities life and the
people they lived with. And.

589
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,080
Were associated with. They
sometimes, and this is a really

590
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,160
fascinating thing, they
sometimes carry in their body

591
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,960
scars that are related to the
death wounds of the previous

592
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,360
personality in their previous
life, so that it not only mind

593
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,060
transfers from life to life, but
in some cases, even sort of a

594
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,860
cellular memory, some transfers
from life to life.

595
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,960
Vanese McNeill: I, as a very
young girl, had a friend, my

596
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,280
father's friend, who had a
constant pain in his right

597
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,740
shoulder, and he went to a past
life regressionist Who told him

598
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:46,480
that he had had a sword stabbed
directly down his body, and

599
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,900
through the process of
acknowledging that he felt a

600
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,220
sharp pain, the things start
filling up from the bottom and

601
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,640
was healed completely as a
result of processing that wound,

602
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:04,500
which is very much like the work
that you're doing, or the work

603
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,600
that you have done for us, it is
akin to the personal work that

604
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,420
we do on ourselves. If we
identify a trauma that's

605
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,500
happened in our life, we look at
it, we heal it. And so you did

606
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:23,600
that for us on many, many levels
of human and cosmic

607
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,280
consciousness, right? So again,
there's kind of a Mandelbrot of

608
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,200
healing that proceeds up and
down this chain. And

609
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,860
Chris Bache: you know, it may
sound exotic describing it after

610
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,360
the fact, but when you're in it,
it feels like the most natural

611
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,240
thing of the world. And again, I
don't think you have to be a

612
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,920
saint to do this things. Any
mother or father worth this salt

613
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,940
when they see not only their
child, but other children

614
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:56,380
suffering, if there's anything
they can do to alleviate that

615
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,060
suffering, they would naturally
do it, because the path of

616
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,880
parents compassion is deepened
by their children to all the

617
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,260
children of the world. So if
you're given an opportunity in

618
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,160
the physical world or in
psychedelic space, if you're

619
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:21,380
given an opportunity to somehow
engage suffering and to bring by

620
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,160
bringing it into awareness, to
heal that suffering. It's the

621
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,220
most natural thing in the world
to do that. I don't know whether

622
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,340
I think that I did this work not
because I had to. I did this

623
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:42,400
work because it was chosen by my
soul before I was born. I think

624
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,860
all of us who chose to enter
time and space during this very,

625
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:53,920
very intense period, in a way, I
think, took on more karma than

626
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,080
was maybe common in centuries
past, that just to be here, to

627
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,060
live in these very, very
challenging times is to take on

628
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,980
heavy responsibilities for the
entire human family. We are

629
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,160
doing this in the physical
world, just as we do it in our

630
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,940
psychedelic sessions. And I
think that we chose it. We knew

631
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,840
what we were getting into, and
we are now here living it out,

632
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,620
bringing it into fruition inside
physical world.

633
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,900
Vanese McNeill: I have always
been a compassionate person.

634
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,800
Chris, I've been accused of
being pathologically forgiving,

635
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:42,220
but I find that in this moment,
my compassion is increasing at

636
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:47,980
an exponential rate like I feel
I can I can see in myself I am

637
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,640
being forced to grow. I'm being
pulled to grow. And I see that

638
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:57,940
happening to a lot of people
around us. So I I concur that we

639
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,820
can all do this work on many
different levels, and it's just

640
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:08,100
important to heal your child as
it is, you know, to do the large

641
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,020
scale work that you did. I don't
know. I mean, it's just again, I

642
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,340
keep coming back to the point
that I really would encourage

643
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:21,860
everybody to either read your
book or to come to this seven

644
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:27,200
week course, I feel that it is
God's work that you're sharing

645
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,440
with us, my dear, and that the
people that come to this class

646
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,760
are going to have a an expanded
understanding of the workings of

647
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,080
The universe and how to be kind
of a soldier in the

648
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:49,120
transformation towards this
diamond human being that we all

649
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,360
want to get to. And the sooner
the better, right? The less

650
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,400
chaos the better. And so that's
why I wanted to take this time

651
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,500
and to kind of share this with
with the people. At fans of

652
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,680
MAGICAL EGYPT, because I think
you know, you're greasing the

653
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,460
wheels, my dear, you're making
it just that little bit easier.

654
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,720
Chris Bache: It is, in some
ways, like being a soldier, but

655
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,040
it is a very different kind of
soldier, isn't it, because here,

656
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,760
one conquers by surrendering
you. You you you confront evil

657
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,680
or pain, and you don't fight it.
You let it in. You surrender to

658
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,480
it. It becomes part of your
world, and then it moves through

659
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,920
you, and it's resolves itself.
So it's a very peculiar way.

660
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,980
It's it's like a woman in labor
doesn't fight her pain. She

661
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,640
cooperates with it. She works
with it. She surrenders to it.

662
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,420
She lets the pain carry her
through the birth process. It's

663
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,240
like that in a psychedelic
session. And you know, this was

664
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,420
a hard book for me to write. It
was hard for me. It took me

665
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,140
years to get my head around
sharing these sessions, because,

666
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,420
you know, they're the deepest
experiences I've ever had in my

667
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:12,060
life. They're the the my
experiences of God. And at first

668
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,260
I wanted to publish this book
posthumously, just wait till I

669
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:21,200
die and leave it behind, but the
mother told me, No, you can't

670
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:26,720
read that, there's not enough
time, we're going into choppy

671
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,760
water. All hands on deck,
please. Thank you very much. All

672
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,360
of us need to show up and put
our gifts forward so that

673
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,380
together we can support each
other, we can nourish each other

674
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,920
and bring this critical period
of history to good outcome.

675
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,780
Bring us through it faster.
We'll go through it faster. If

676
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,860
we go through it smart, if we go
through it with compassion, we

677
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,460
can admit we can reduce the
suffering. It's like, you know,

678
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,620
the global climate crisis, the
conferences which have just

679
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:06,600
taken place, the g20 if we are
smart and take more aggressive

680
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,560
steps, we can minimize we can
reduce the pain and suffering.

681
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,860
If we don't act with
intelligence and courage, we're

682
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,840
going to increase the suffering
later. So we all have options as

683
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,100
we come into this period of
history. We all have options. We

684
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,700
all have choices. We're all part
of the human family dealing with

685
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:30,020
this. And the more we know, the
more we understand, the more we

686
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:34,700
trust, the better our choices
can be, the speedier outcome,

687
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,100
the better world we can leave
for our grandchildren.

688
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,780
Vanese McNeill: Well, we're
blessed to have you, Chris, and

689
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,900
I'm so glad you didn't wait,
because then I wouldn't have had

690
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:48,820
the opportunity to talk to you
and and I think hearing this,

691
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,380
you know, from your own voice,
is so powerful. So I want to

692
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,280
apologize, first of all that my
connection has been so bad.

693
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,940
Next, I want to point people in
the chat, there is a link to

694
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,800
Chris's course that's coming up
again, I highly suggest that you

695
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,200
go. If you can't go, please
share it, just so that we can

696
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,000
have as many hands on deck as
Chris said. And I want to thank

697
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,240
you, my dear so much for your
time today and holding my

698
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,280
breath, you know, surrendering,

699
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,020
Chris Bache: doing what I can.

are curious, wondering, and who

714
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,540
are workers who really want to
bring about a better world.

715
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,720
Vanese McNeill: I'm sure it will
be the best group of people.

716
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:44,980
Darlin, I'm sure we'll come away
with wonderful new friends. So

I'm going to email this to all
the MAGICAL EGYPT people, so

720
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,060

well. So thank you, Chris. You

00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,360
have a wonderful evening, and it
starts on the 17th. Is that

722
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,000
correct? So coming up? Well,
actually, the

723
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:13,620
Unknown: course itself starts on
November 30. Oh, fantastic.

724
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah, there was, there's a an
invitational event, a one hour

725
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,320
Invitational event in which
Steve Dean and I talk about the

726
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,920
course and what it's going to be
that's going to be rebroadcast

727
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,640
on the 16th here. I don't know
whether that's 17th where you

728
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,900
are, but basically the course
will not start until November

729
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,980
30. Okay, every Tuesday for
three weeks, we take two weeks

730
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,540
off for Christmas holidays, and
then four weeks through January.

731
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,320

we'll see lots of MAGICAL EGYPT

Chris Bache: Thank you. Thank
you very much. Vaness, bye, bye.

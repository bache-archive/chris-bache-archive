**Abstract:**

In this Vancouver IONS Community Group session, CHRIS BACHE presents a concise tour of empirical

evidence for reincarnation, beginning with Ian Stevenson’s fieldwork on children who remember prior

lives, characteristic patterns in those cases, and mainstream medical journal responses. He reviews key

critiques, notably Paul Edwards’ objections, and Robert Almeder’s philosophical rebuttals. Bache then

surveys additional literatures: journalistic audits (Tom Shroder), contemporary research continuations

(Jim Tucker), regression therapy (Roger Woolger, Winafred Lucas, Carol Bowman), and between-lives

case studies (Michael Newton). He closes the talk by noting what remains unknown—the “physics” of

rebirth and mind–brain relations—and cautions against overgeneralizing from atypical child cases.

The Q&A explores species-level reincarnation and purification, karma versus growth, aging and the

fear of death, and whether incarnation extends beyond Earth. Bache frames humanity’s emergence of a

“diamond soul” consciousness as a long, collective birth process already well underway.

# Part 1

**HOST:** Welcome, everyone. This is the Vancouver IONS Community Group, and I’m delighted to welcome

back Chris Bache, PhD, to explore another area of his work, which he wrote about in *Life Cycles: A Study

of Reincarnation*. Reincarnation evokes all kinds of responses—belief, disbelief, and curiosity. Based on

my own experience, I’m in the believer camp. Many of you have read Chris’s books and appreciated the

depth of his work.

**HOST:** Chris is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown

State University, adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an Emeritus Fellow at the

Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the board of Grof® Legacy Training. He’s the author of four books:

*Life Cycles* on reincarnation; *Dark Night, Early Dawn* on psychedelic philosophy and collective

consciousness; *The Living Classroom* on collective fields of consciousness in teaching; and *LSD and the

Mind of the Universe*, the story of his 20-year journey with high-dose LSD. He lives in Weaverville, North

Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy, an astrologer and past-life therapist. Chris, thank you for being here.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Hi, everybody. It’s great to see you, and thank you for your warm greetings. I hope we

have some fun today.

**CHRIS BACHE:** A quick update you might enjoy. In 2008 I published *The Living Classroom* without

mentioning psychedelics. SUNY Press is bringing out a new edition—ebook now, hardback coming, and

paperback later. This time they let me tell the full story: I was a university professor taking large

therapeutic doses of LSD, and here is what unfolded with my students, and the field theory of classrooms

that emerged. It’s a joy to stitch together the two halves of my life that had to be separated.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Before publishing on psychedelics, I tackled a more fundamental question that divides

world philosophies: reincarnation. If this is our only life, one worldview follows; if we live many lives, a

different worldview opens. After graduate school I discovered an astonishing empirical literature that takes

reincarnation seriously—none of which had been covered in my courses. Ian Stevenson at the University of

Virginia persuaded me we were looking at a fact of nature. I had to erase my intellectual blackboard and

start over. If reincarnation is real, we inhabit a very different universe than I thought.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Evolution moves group learning forward across generations. At some stage individuality

matures and nature finds a way to carry *personal* learning forward—cascading accumulations of knowledge,

wisdom, and skill. On my first sabbatical I wrote *Life Cycles*. It opens with a chapter on the evidence and

then explores implications for family, relationships, and larger patterns.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I once gave a compact, 35-minute lecture assembling the scientific evidence. I can’t do it

better extemporaneously, so I’ll walk you through that material now, then we’ll have plenty of time for Q&A.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The most important philosophical question is whether we survive bodily death. The next is

whether we live once or many times. It hinges on time. As a teacher, if I give a quiz, I expect one level of

performance; an hour exam, more; a take-home paper, more still. If the universe has a purpose, we must

measure it against the time available to fulfill it. If we live once, the scope is limited. If we live a hundred,

a thousand, or ten thousand lives—if our involvement is open-ended—our relationship with existence and

our sense of purpose change fundamentally.

**CHRIS BACHE:** For the last 4,000 years many religions have tended to devalue physical existence: achieve

enlightenment or salvation and *leave*—escape samsara. That leaves the purpose of the universe strangely

unanswered. But if we return many times, a different story unfolds—one we’re only beginning to glimpse,

just as we’ve only recently grasped the true breadth and age of the cosmos.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Evidence. The book that changed my life was Ian Stevenson’s *Twenty Cases Suggestive

of Reincarnation*. Stevenson—Carlson Professor at UVA—ultimately wrote eleven books, including the

multi-volume *Cases of the Reincarnation Type*, *Unlearned Language* (children speaking languages not

heard in their environment), and his magnum opus, *Reincarnation and Biology* (two volumes, ~2,000 pages)

documenting 187 cases where children’s birthmarks and defects correlate with the previous person’s

fatal wounds.

**CHRIS BACHE:** What do these cases look like? Children—often between ages three and eight—recount

detailed memories of a recent life. They recognize people they’ve never met, navigate towns they’ve never

visited, display appropriate emotional responses to former spouses, children, or rivals, and recall the inner

architecture of homes. In one case a child led family members to a hidden will beneath a kitchen floorboard.

Patterns emerge: average intermission about 2.5 years; average geographical separation about 50 miles;

memories fade as schooling and puberty advance.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Why do some children remember what most of us forget? Stevenson hypothesized—cautiously—

that traumatic, sudden, or unfinished deaths may compress the interval and increase proximity, “pulling” a

return and preserving memory traces. About 60% of cases involve violent death; the rest involve abrupt

endings or strong unfinished business.

**CHRIS BACHE:** How did mainstream medicine respond? *JAMA* wrote that Stevenson had “painstakingly

and unemotionally collected” detailed cases whose evidence is hard to explain otherwise. The *Journal of

Nervous and Mental Disease* devoted an entire issue to his work and editorialized that his methods and

reasoning conformed to the canons of rational inquiry.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The pushback came, too. Philosopher Paul Edwards’ *Reincarnation: A Critical Examination*

accused Stevenson of methodological laxity and implied fraud. More fundamentally, Edwards argued that

accepting reincarnation would “crucify” secular understanding, since it seems to entail collateral assumptions:

that materialism is false, mind isn’t reducible to brain, identity exceeds personality, there is a non-spacetime

domain, death is illusory, and life may have a deeper logic. He deemed these “surely fantastic.”

**CHRIS BACHE:** Philosopher Robert Almeder analyzed the exchange and showed that Edwards largely begged

the question—assuming precisely what’s in dispute, namely that consciousness cannot exist independent of

the brain. If an argument’s premises are met by recalcitrant data and you can’t refute it, refusing assent is

irrational. In short: Edwards didn’t defeat Stevenson; he refused to engage the data on their own terms.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Journalistic audit: Tom Shroder’s *Old Souls*—Shroder, a Pulitzer-level reporter and editor

at *The Washington Post*, shadowed Stevenson in the field and concluded the cases and methods were

compelling.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Continuation at UVA: Jim Tucker’s *Life Before Life* and *Return to Life* present accessible

analyses that address alternative hypotheses (e.g., fraud, suggestion, cryptomnesia, ESP) and show why

they don’t fit the data as well as reincarnation.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Beyond spontaneous recall is evoked memory: regression therapy and related techniques.

Roger Woolger’s *Other Lives, Other Selves* is a thoughtful, clinically grounded treatment; Winafred

Lucas’s two-volume *Regression Therapy: A Handbook for Professionals* collected pioneering clinical work.

Carol Bowman’s *Children’s Past Lives* and *Return from Heaven* arose from helping her own child and then

many families navigate spontaneous traumatic recall and intra-family return claims.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Michael Newton’s between-lives work—*Journey of Souls* and *Destiny of Souls*—found

that in deep hypnosis many clients remember not only prior incarnations but the structured inter-life: mentors,

learning groups, councils, life reviews, and carefully chosen incarnational plans made with collaborators.

Across backgrounds—fundamentalist, atheist, secular—reports converged on a coherent, educative order.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Two further public cases: Robert Snow, commander of homicide in Indianapolis, reluctantly

followed the evidence from an unexpected regression and tracked down *Carroll Beckwith*—documenting

striking correspondences in *Looking for Carroll Beckwith*. Bruce and Andrea Leininger’s *Soul Survivor*

traces their son James’s WWII pilot memories from nightmares to meeting squadron members who validated

specifics, moving a skeptical father to conclude reincarnation best fit the facts.

**CHRIS BACHE:** What we don’t know: the “physics” of rebirth—what the soul is, how it interfaces with

genetics and neurobiology, how learning encodes and is carried forward. We won’t get far while reducing

mind to brain. A post-materialist, multi-dimensional cosmology is needed.

**CHRIS BACHE:** A paradox: Stevenson’s strongest cases show the *tightest* continuity—short intervals,

close geography, vivid memory—liberating our thinking and, ironically, constricting it if we assume they’re

typical. Most intermissions are probably longer and more varied. To fill in the canvas we need additional

bodies of data—between-lives reports, contemplative and psychedelic research—alongside child cases.

That’s where a larger vision of our life cycle comes into view.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you.

**HOST:** Wonderful—thank you, Chris. Let’s open it up for questions. Please use the “raise hand” and

we’ll call on you.

**VICTORIA:** That was lovely. You answered one of my questions about how your view has evolved, but

two remain. First, you speak of species-level reincarnation—given our current situation, could you say

more? Second, what do you mean by “purification” and “detoxification” in *LSD and the Mind of the

Universe*—individually and collectively?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I began my psychedelic work expecting personal transformation, maybe personal

enlightenment. The method dissolved me so deeply into collective consciousness that species-level dynamics

activated. In one late experience, in deep space, I felt Earth’s pulse as a cadence of reincarnation—roughly

centennial. Humanity appeared as cells in a superorganism evolving through individual life-tasks. It was

magnificent—and it underscored that what we think is private is always networked.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Purification shows up personally and collectively. Mystical opening churns the psyche,

bringing distortions to the surface to be seen, felt, and released; then deeper communion becomes possible.

Species-history stores unprocessed wounds—war, plague, childbirth deaths, ungrieved losses—in collective

memory. As we grow into wider identity, this material surfaces for metabolizing. Exponential growth

requires exponential purification. It’s challenging, but it’s how complex systems evolve.

**VICTORIA:** It brings up so much emotion. It feels like patriarchy needs to be released—huge! And what

does that mean in day-to-day terms?

**CHRIS BACHE:** I’ll risk a political toe-stub. We recently faced a choice between very different leadership

archetypes. Collectively we chose nostalgia and retrenchment. That will hurt. Whether faster worsening is

ultimately clarifying, I don’t know. Reincarnation helps me drop judgment: everyone is at their developmental

level, on their assignment. My focus is to do the best I can, with those who see what I see. In nonlinear,

energized systems, small inputs leverage big shifts—the butterfly effect. As the field heats up, individual

impact increases.

**JAN:** I loved the talk. I’m writing a memoir in three parts and trying to do it without blame. I want to

make a difference with my writing, but the world feels chaotic. How do I hold my focus? I’m 83 and

conscious of time.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The writer’s life is a mountain: close the door, open the windows, hold the line. *LSD and

the Mind of the Universe* took me five years at the keyboard and twenty to live. Trust your calling. Go deep.

Offer your best, then let it go without attachment to outcomes. High intention; no clinging to results. Legacy

work matters—especially now.

**JAN:** Thank you. Reading *Life Cycles* earlier might have changed my life, but perhaps I did what I needed

to do to move on.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The pressure cooker is on—and it can catalyze remarkable work.

**CHRISTOPHER:** Thank you for the presentation. As a child I was taught sin and debt; later, karma and

debt. Is reincarnation bound to karma? And I’ve heard karma is lessening—are we paying it off?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Cause and effect pervades physical and spiritual life, but our framing has been too narrow.

If you read only regression therapy, you might conclude life is mostly about fixing what’s broken. But most

souls *pass* their karmic tests. We carry forward not just liabilities but assets—skills, relationships,

virtues. People don’t visit therapists to celebrate victories, so the literature can skew negative.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Religions of the axial age discovered depth states and naturally longed to *stay there*—

to leave here. But as we grasp the immensity of “here,” it makes sense that the task is to *incarnate* spirit,

to bring heaven into body and culture. I see the ego—guardian of a single lifetime—giving birth to the soul

that integrates *all* lifetimes into a fused singularity: the “diamond soul.” That is a different magnitude of

mind—a 100,000-year consciousness. To arrive, we must sweat out divisions—race, nation, class, creed.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In crisis our hearts are broken open. This is a multigenerational task. And when grace

touches us, the Infinite can dissolve karmic knots swiftly. Learn what needs learning; release the rest. As

Robert Monroe glimpsed in a far future, the “bardo” thins as embodiment becomes translucent to diamond

light. As we process our backlog—individually and collectively—transparency increases. With clear access,

no technical or social problem is beyond solution.

**JANINE:** Thank you so much. One person’s experience is another’s “woo-woo.” I’ve had a soul retrieval

that shifted me in two days from overwhelmed to expansive joy—things can happen fast. Also, have you

looked at unified-field work like Nassim Haramein’s?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Your soul-retrieval example maps beautifully: retrieving alienated parts and welcoming

them home mirrors our historical process of retrieving our collective soul. As for physics, I’m happily retired

from keeping up with every thread, but yes—Akashic-field models, field theories, and complexity science

offer fertile ground for bridges.

**NORMA:** I’m studying getting old. I’m losing identity. Each decade I’m a different person. Now I feel like

I’m becoming “people-less.” Dust to dust. This actually excites me.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I resonate. At 75 my skin and bones feel looser; memories loosen too, and egoless spaces

are easier to enter. At the end there’s a great release—light to light. I’ve told my children since they were

small: it’s a great life, and at the end you get to die. Death is graduation, coming home. If I could give one

gift, it would be freedom from the fear of death. Birth is when the hard work begins; death is fulfillment.

**HOST:** A question I often hear: is reincarnation strictly human on Earth, or broader in the cosmos?

**CHRIS BACHE:** My work focused on human consciousness because we’re the greatest current threat to

Earth’s life. Cultures that accept rebirth generally place its beginnings before the human stage—somewhere

as individuality emerges from collective fields in higher animals. Once you reach a threshold, there’s little

point “going back,” except perhaps by special arrangement—the calculus/algebra analogy. As for other

worlds: why not? If evolution operates elsewhere, incarnation likely does too. There are therapists who help

clients integrate memories of non-terrestrial lifetimes.

**HOST:** Beautiful. Any final thoughts before we close?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Reincarnation doesn’t end questions; it begins richer ones. It frees us from the tyranny of

short time. Think in 10,000-year increments. Develop every latent talent. What’s emerging is a luminous,

embodied consciousness—green world merging with light world—an awakened humanity born into history.

When the child arrives, we’ll say it was worth it. And women must lead more fully now; when half of us

shows up wholly, all of us are stronger. Most of the long labor is done. We’re in the last stretch of waking.

**HOST:** Thank you, Chris. And thanks to everyone for being here. *\[laughter, goodbyes\]*

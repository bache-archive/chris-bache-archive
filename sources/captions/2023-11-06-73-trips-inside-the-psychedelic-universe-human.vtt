00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi, everybody.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.840
We're going to have a phenomenal conversation
in just a moment here with Christopher Bache,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.059
who I consider to be, and I know
he'll be blushing if I say this, but really

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.029
a hero
of our times for being willing to take on

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.340
a journey that most of us would not be able
to withstand to find out about the nature

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.340
of consciousness.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.130
The mind of the universe.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.550
In his book, LSD, the Mind of the Universe,
he shares with us his experiences of some,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:39.000
I think 73 different journeys he did with
a very prescribed protocol and with someone

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.050
sitting with him and protecting him over
decades to be able to journey sequentially

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.250
further
and further out into what the future of

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.780
humanity looks like.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.289
So here we go.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.340
Meet Christopher Bache.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.780
If you don't already know him.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.780
Hello, Christopher.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.780
It's so good to see you.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.780
Hi, Regina.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.780
How are you?

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.780
I'm doing well.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.939
I'll tell you, I say that
very sincerely after reading your book

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.160
the other people who I know who've read your
book as well, the question that comes up

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.830
about halfway through is, why in the world
did

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.159
he continue?

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.590
When you went through that much pain,
that much suffering, enough that it took months,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.620
even a year to recover from a journey,
but you would come back, you were relentless

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.189
in your search.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.090
So just set it up really briefly for people.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.150
What made you do this?

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.810
You're a professor of theology, philosophy.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.680
What made you go on this journey starting
way back when?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.811
At first, I think it was a foolish
strategy to push it as hard as I did, but

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.259
I didn't
know any better at the time or I was young

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.000
and stupid.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.840
But I was trained as a philosopher
of religion with a passionate desire to

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.000
understand the deep structure of the universe.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.700
I had studied some of the great minds in our
Western philosophical and Eastern traditions.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.810
When I found this methodology that Stan made
available,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.970
I just decided to push it as long and as hard
as I could.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.420
And there was a great deal of suffering on
it,

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.550
episodically and periodically.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.790
But at the end of every episode of intense
suffering,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.700
there would be a breakthrough into
an episode, a phase of deep ecstatic bliss

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.440
and deep transpersonal encounter.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.120
And the value of those insights and that ecstasy
balanced out, more than balanced out,

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.510
the transient episodes of suffering.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.260
In the beginning, when you first started
the journey, the very beginning part

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.920
was what you title in the book.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.590
And it took you 20 years or so after all these
experiences to

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.650
finally write this book and put it out for
the rest of us.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.659
It was called The Death of Ego.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:56.890
And while you were in the midst of it,
you were saying, 'What was I thinking?'

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.930
So let's just set it up with what that very
first-

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.610
and we only have about 45 minutes,
people are going to have to read the book

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.980
themselves,
we're going to hopscotch through the phases

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.390
you went through.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.569
But let's start with
'What was I thinking?'

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.799
What happens upon the dissolution of the ego?

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.110
If you want to allow your consciousness to
expand into the broader dimensions,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.239
the deeper dimensions of consciousness,
you must surrender the narrow bandwidth of

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.840
your individual body,
mind, ego.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.500
And so this happens slowly or fast, convulsively
or smoothly.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.170
But that identity
that we hold has to be shattered, has to be

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.319
kind of destroyed.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.860
And when it's destroyed, then
your consciousness does naturally expand-

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.060
expands into a deeper register of wider spectrum
of consciousness.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.540
If you do this,
if your journey continues repeatedly, as we'll

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.420
get to,
you go through many such death sequences.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.340
But it's not repeating the original ego death,
the original ego death is kind of the first

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.610
transition from your time space identity into
a deeper spiritual experience of the universe.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.629
Thank you for that.

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.000
And on the subject of death,
as you come to say, toward the end of the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.290
book,
you relished the death process.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.130
By the end, death was something you looked
forward to in each one of these journeys,

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.840
because it freed you so much from all of the
constraints in terms of consciousness.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.560
And so we'll build up to that.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.199
But one of the arts you went through
was you became a woman,

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.390
you started experiencing the life birthing
all these elements of being a woman,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.919
which was part of your identity is to be a
male

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.470
to be an academic, and so forth.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.220
Just briefly, what was your experience?

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.979
What did that do to you
when you suddenly connected with the female

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.910
experience after being male?

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.780
About two and a half years into my journey,
about 10/11 sessions, and the universe put

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.960
me into this situation where I could
experience nothing except from within feminine

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960
identity.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.270
A feminine identity.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.449
And it was a feminine form,
a womanly form that was the exact opposite

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.320
of my own male, academic, intellectually oriented
form.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.800
And it was totally terrifying to experience
myself being me, but not being me within a

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.240
framework that I'd ever known before.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.310
And it just snapped me.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.949
And so when I let go,
and I yielded, then I became hundreds,

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.080
potentially thousands of women, and was given
a journey

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.040
into the world of women under the arm of the
Great Mother.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.210
And it was an ecstatic experience,
a wonderful experience.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.270
In fact, when it opened,
I thought, 'What was I so afraid of?'

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.550
'Why was I afraid of this?

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.910
This is marvelous.'

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.650
And what was the universe was doing was,
it was basically teaching me that where

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.000
I was going, gender does not exist.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.009
So all gender, all roles based on gender and
any aspect of my

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.890
historical personality had to be surrendered.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.820
If I were going to experience more intimately,
what is there in the universe.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.120
So I would ask you this on behalf of the men
and women watching this,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.000
what was the most either terrifying
or irritating and difficult part initially,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.150
being confronted with a woman's reality?

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.270
The most terrifying part
in the beginning was it just wasn't my reality.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.000
It was a reality, but it wasn't my reality.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.500
And I couldn't get out of it.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.410
I was trapped within a
feminine mode of experience that just wasn't

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.720
me.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.410
There was nothing inherently frightening about
it.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:50.110
And then when I let go and flowed with that
experience, oh, what a- it was like having

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.570
half
of the human race open to me that had not

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.360
been
open to me before.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.070
Now I believe in reincarnation
and I believe we've been men and women many

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.070
times.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.629
So there's nothing foreign in that way.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:01.629
This was different.

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.910
This was kind of opening almost into,
I don't want to say an archetypal dimension

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.000
of womanhood,
but certainly to the collective life

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.840
being lived by women in history, in time.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.900
So the joy was just to experience a whole
different way

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.170
of being alive than I had known as Chris Bache.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.770
As the academic as the male engaging in academic
conversation.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.650
And here you're dealing with a very
different kind of connection and flow between

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.650
women.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.849
Yeah, I thought that was fascinating.

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:37.740
It's an interesting part of your book.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.280
I wish every
man could have an experience like this.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.110
It truly, it does change things profoundly.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.069
You know,
and the other way around and women should

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:47.069
have the other.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:51.890
So we understand what each other is
contending with in our bodies in this reality.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.190
So let's move forward to session 11.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.140
And this, there much has happened since then
time has passed,

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.140
of course.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:07.610
But when we go into session 11,
it really becomes about archetypal deep mass

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.139
suffering
that you had to go through witness and experience.

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:15.350
And if you could tell us what that body of
body

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.350
of memory, collective memory felt like and
what it

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.500
looked like to you, that would be helpful
because

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.729
we're still in it.

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:27.970
My transition from an ego
death process, which is very personal related

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.920
to what
came over the next two years.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:38.610
So it's a series of
excruciatingly difficult, horrendous ways

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:45.149
of vast
landscapes of human suffering, war, violence,

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:48.050
just unimaginable suffering.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.089
It was transitioned by an
experience called the killing of the children.

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:54.380
And I just want to mention that because it's
an

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.460
important signal.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.110
In between those two,
I had this experience of being an old woman

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.760
confronting
soldiers who were just killing thousands

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.280
and thousands of children, just smashing their
heads

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.790
on rocks, this terrible, terrible ordeal.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.209
And I think this experience was given to me
to prepare

00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:17.110
for me for what was going to come this ocean
of

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.850
suffering phase.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.130
That is it awakened the depth of
compassion in me, which I think was embedded

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.980
at
a soul level to prepare me to take on the

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.820
work,
which is something my soul had chosen to do

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.900
in
this lifetime.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:37.130
What I learned was that just as
individual trauma gets buried in our individual

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:45.290
psyche and can compromise our individual health,
the trauma of history is buried in the collective

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.660
psyche of humanity.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.690
And so anything which is not
resolved by the species that any one generation

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:58.000
accumulates in these massive memory structures
that I call metacoic systems.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.410
And what I think
was happening was that something guiding my

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.420
sessions
began to use my sessions in order to confront,

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:12.190
absorb and transmute vast territories of collective
anguish

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:17.630
hat were embedded in the collective psyche,
meaning the patient stopped being Chris Bache.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:23.399
And in some way, the patient became some aspect
of the human species.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:28.300
So with that, I want to ask you about something
that's happening currently.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.209
We have all of this
going on in the Middle East between Palestine

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:33.570
and Israel.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:39.950
And we have collective side taking,
we have collective anger, depression, anxiety

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.050
all occurring.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:49.230
And we have a propensity toward people
who have been, have proclivities toward prophecy

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.880
to look at this as the end times, whether
it's

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.950
a Christian community waiting for rapture,
whether it's conspiracy groups saying, no,

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.290
this is
a planned end time for humanity.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.589
We get into these end times
stories that start circulating.

00:11:02.589 --> 00:11:05.820
But I want to ask you,
having been through what you went through,

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.329
you have this overlay to it in your psyche
that

00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:09.829
I'd like to know about.

00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:14.790
Could you tell us how you
see these times laid into what you went through?

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:22.271
Jumping many years ahead in my work,
and I summarize my experiences of our time

00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:24.880
in history,
what's happening underneath the surface,

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:29.270
where we're going in a chapter called
The Birth of the Future Human.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:34.940
And there, I was given a number
of visions over many years of humanity coming

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:40.250
to a turning point, humanity coming to a
spiritual breakthrough, an evolutionary turning

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.680
point,
a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.880
psyche.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:51.310
And then eventually, in 1995,
was taken in a very deep experience dissolved

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.899
into the species mind,
dissolved into what I call deep time,

00:11:55.899 --> 00:12:02.820
being taken into the future and where
I experienced a death and rebirth process

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.700
of the human family altogether,
not as an individual,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.350
but the death and rebirth of humanity.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:14.200
It was a global systems crisis that
was seemed to be precipitated by a series

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.960
of escalating ecological crises.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.430
Now, beyond that, I wasn't given any details
about it.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.560
I wasn't given dates.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.310
I wasn't given any specific, nothing about
artificial intelligence,

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.220
nothing about a third world war, nothing like
that,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:37.279
just the experience of the human family going
through a prolonged period of an absolute

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:40.449
loss
of control and a collapse of everything they

00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:43.940
had considered the normal and necessary goods
or

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.170
or standards of their world.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.000
Ever since that time,
I've lived with this awareness.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.800
And for me,
it's not a projected fantasy.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.610
It's not something which I envisioned.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.480
It's something which I experienced.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.949
So for me, I can't, I don't question
the truth of it.

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:05.240
So I experienced this period of history.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:13.279
It's a period of increasing a destabilization
and increasing escalation of conflicts

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:21.610
and breaking down all our norms and our norms
and conflict between races, conflict between

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.160
religions, complex between conflict, between
sexes,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.079
between classes, all the tremendous things
that

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:32.010
we've been doing to each other, terrible
things over thousands and thousands and thousands

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.220
of years.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:39.290
We have to go beyond where we are and
grow spiritually into the next form that's

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.550
emerging,
I think, in an evolutionary sense in the human

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.260
as the human form.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.510
So I think this is what we're going into.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.529
That's why we're beginning to
experience so much destabilization.

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:57.149
And I think what's happening now is not in
any way a final or

00:13:57.149 --> 00:13:59.580
turning point or any final register.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.949
I think we're going we're in a process which
will continue to

00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:07.470
deepen for decades and decades to come.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.690
So this is, I think, just the overture of
what's coming

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.639
and the terrible events unfolding in the Middle
East

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:21.320
and other countries and many African countries,
other places in the United States.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.259
These are bringing to the surface age old
hatreds

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:28.740
and we have to transform these hatreds.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.649
And I don't offer any political social solution
to

00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:35.970
the events we're looking at.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.940
My perspective is not at the ground level.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.490
My perspective is from the
level far above the earth, looking at the

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.779
long
evolutionary trajectory forms.

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:50.040
Thank you for that incredibly thoughtful and
articulate answer.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.029
And now what we'll do, because we did jump
ahead

00:14:52.029 --> 00:14:54.920
a bit there, which we'll work our way back
toward,

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.760
there are some other things in there.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.630
But let's go back now to session number 15,
where you learned

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.680
about karma because all of this has karma
embedded in it.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.339
You learned about the essence of karma.

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:08.870
And tell us what you learned about karma at
that time.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.579
I had already, I mean, I was an academic
and I was a professor of religious studies.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.209
So I had an intellectual understanding of
karma, which is

00:15:15.209 --> 00:15:19.259
simply cause and effect generated by choices
that we make.

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:22.531
There are physical cause and effect processes
and there's

00:15:22.531 --> 00:15:25.209
psychological cause and effect processes.

00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:30.480
And in the traditional worldview
of karmic thought, every choice we make sets

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.899
in
motion a series of events, which eventually

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:35.630
we
received the consequences of, we received

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.360
the effects of,
and by receiving the effects

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.459
of our choices, we learn from those choices
and we make a new set of choices.

00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:49.620
What I learned in session 15
wasn't so much a theoretical interpretation

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.750
of karma
because I had that.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:57.180
It was a seeing and being shown the karma
of my particular life.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.100
I went through a series of sessions for a
year,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:06.060
over and over again for seven sessions,
where I experienced the entirety of my life

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.170
from beginning
to end as a happening, as a totality,

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:12.950
as a finished complete totality.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:18.040
And this is my first entry
into what I came to call deep time.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:24.369
And in that context, when I looked at relationships,
the relationships around me, my people,

00:16:24.369 --> 00:16:31.040
when I that I was working with in
my professional life, I could see how deeply

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:39.519
embedded they were in a deeper series of karmic
causal processes that my position in history

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:40.970
was not accidental.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.790
The people I was with were not accidental.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.779
It was a meaningful fabric.

00:16:47.779 --> 00:16:52.070
Then the question became simply,
how do you respond most effectively

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.270
to a meaningful fabric that your life is part
of?

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.950
Okay, that brings us to something that
I wasn't going to ask you about, but it seems

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.529
like the
right point.

00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:07.260
You just spoke about every decision
we make has an effect.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:15.350
And so yesterday, two days ago,
a book was released by Dr. Robert Sapolsky.

00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.500
And it has to do with the science of living
with

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.579
no free will, the title, something like that,
as I recall.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:27.560
But essentially, he came to the conclusion
that there is no such thing as making a decision

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:33.100
in free will, that we're machines,
and we cannot lay anything that we do upon

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.429
ourselves any more
than we would any other machine.

00:17:36.429 --> 00:17:38.760
So I would love for you to respond to that.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.299
Well, I haven't read that book.

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:41.299
- of course.

00:17:41.299 --> 00:17:43.170
And so no, just came out.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.170
Yeah.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:49.130
And, but that's a very familiar position
among my philosophers in my department,

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.840
among philosophers in general.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.850
And it derives from a
vision of the universe, which is based upon

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.800
a
19th century metaphysics, which sees the universe

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.720
as a machine, as a deterministic machine,
and all the parts are determined by the larger

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.380
movement
of the whole.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.890
And we have no freedom.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:11.830
But I think that's a deeply outmoded
and outdated vision of reality.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:17.860
We're now looking at a quantum world,
we're in a world which values indeterminacy,

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.890
that there is much more flexibility in the
system than

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.350
we had previously thought.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:29.360
96% of the entire
of reality is dark matter or dark energy.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.100
And we don't know anything about it.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.809
I think if we just step back,
it's clear that much of our psychological

00:18:34.809 --> 00:18:38.610
life is clearly highly conditioned.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.860
But within that highly conditioned context,
we make choices and the choices we make

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:48.100
can increase the conditioning,
or it can reduce the conditioning.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.100
Exactly.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:56.039
And we can increase our freedom,
but nobody exists in pure absolute freedom,

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:59.289
except perhaps the awakened, the fully enlightened
beings,

00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:03.780
but we can increase the freedom by skillful
choices.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.910
I hope you're enjoying this video because

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.390
Thanks.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.720
I was very disturbed because the media picked
right up

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.701
on this and he got a loudspeaker off of this
one.

00:19:32.701 --> 00:19:38.730
I thought, this is so archaic and essentially
saying we have no self responsibility either.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.770
Oh yes, we can't take credit for the best
of us, but we also don't take credit for the

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:44.770
worst of ourselves.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.640
So we have no part in what we do as acting
as machines.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.450
I thought like you, how outdated is this?

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.850
Considering the quantum reality that we're
becoming aware of.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.090
So one thing I wanted to read out of your
book because

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.030
your talk is this feeds into it the notion
of us.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.190
We have a soul.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.350
We have something that transcends this physical
reality,

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.409
which that author does not recognize, by the
way.

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:15.289
So you in when at the end of the karma it
says energy started must simply complete itself

00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:17.340
and that's the nature of karma.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.960
So then I go into this area that I chose
where you're defining the soul itself because

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.990
a lot of people wonder what is it I'm made
of?

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:31.680
You know, at the most the most etheric, most
sublime part of myself.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.350
It says a story of individual consciousness,
ultimately sourced in the creative intelligence

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:43.080
of the cosmos, systematically moving back
and forth between the physical universe and

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.700
a surround metaverse in a long journey of
self development.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:53.000
I think that's one of the best definitions
of soul and the one I probably relate most

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.090
strongly to in my own system of understanding.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.760
Anything that you care to add to that so
people can understand that this soul is here

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.419
for expansion,
experience, choice, and anything

00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:12.650
you'd like to add to that in terms of what
you came to understand is what our soul is

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.179
and what it's here to do.

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:20.809
Just as we have a center of integration that
integrates all of our experiences from this

00:21:20.809 --> 00:21:26.500
lifetime and we're not quite sure how to
describe that or what it is but we know what

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.039
it feels like and what we can understand it.

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:35.279
The soul is simply a center of integration
that integrates all of our experiences from

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:39.770
all of our lifetimes and our times in between
our lifetimes.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:44.080
So it is a center of integration that is a
learning system,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.170
is part of a learning system
which is continuously growing, continuously

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.140
expanding and deepening.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:56.600
If we ask what is the essence of what that
consciousness is, classic spiritual traditions

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:02.350
have said the essence of every individual,
the soul, is the essence of the totality.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.160
Atman is Brahman.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.940
The essence of the soul is the essence of
the divine.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:13.130
For me, the form, in my deepest experience
of the form

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.480
of the soul and the form of all, reality is
light.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.409
It's light but not light as we experience
it

00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:24.929
in the physical world, a much more profound
form of light.

00:22:24.929 --> 00:22:34.279
It is light but it is light which is self-aware
and learning over vast epics of time and continuing

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:41.140
to evolve as it learns and I think we are
coming in the time to a transformation which

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.450
is going to change.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:50.010
I think we are actually giving birth to the
soul inside time and space.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.960
That is usually we die, we expand to the
soul, we incarnate, we contract to ego, we

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.880
die,
we go expand to soul and if we just keep

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.570
that up for a few hundred thousand years,
sooner

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:11.809
or later I think the soul, the integrated
consciousness we return to when we die,

00:23:11.809 --> 00:23:16.870
manifest or wakes up inside the individual
human being

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.240
and that's what I call the birth of the diamond
soul.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.250
Literally wake up inside physical existence.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.580
I think that is the challenge that we are
facing in this century.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:34.260
We no longer have the luxury of trying to
run this planet based on the experience or

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.919
the psychological structure of individual
ego.

00:23:36.919 --> 00:23:40.919
The ego is a magnificent entity but it is
limited,

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:44.830
it is cut off from each other and from the
larger universe.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:51.900
We need to grow up fast and grow up in this
case is to awaken to the soul that we already

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.900
are but we haven't experienced fully inside
time and space.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.300
Well that is an understatement.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.920
Yes, we do need to wake up fast.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:10.450
Now we come to a point where you had a session
and after that you did not have another one

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.670
for six years, you quit for six years.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:19.090
Just briefly a synopsis of the session,
why you stopped for six years and what happened

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.409
when you picked it back up because that's
the fascinating part to me.

00:24:22.409 --> 00:24:28.150
I stopped for six years because my wife who
was my sitter asked me to.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:34.320
Too many things were coming up out of my sessions
that were very novel and disruptive

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.929
and she just wanted the whole thing to slow
down

00:24:36.929 --> 00:24:39.980
and she asked me to stop so I did.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:46.720
And then when I resumed I always knew I would
resume and when I did resume six years later

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.600
I had my wife's support and she continued
to be my sitter through all of the remainder

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.679
of my sessions.

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:56.330
So it was kind of a husband-wife negotiation.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:02.159
Yes, and the other part I found interesting
is that when you pick back up six years later

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:05.890
you're being picked up at the exact same spot
you left off.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.570
That was striking because I was in the middle
of the ocean of suffering work so I was going

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.029
to see horrendous suffering.

00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:18.730
Six years later, different period of my life,
different expectations in different astrological

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:24.669
aspects, my sessions began exactly where it
had stopped and continued to deepen the ocean

00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:27.190
of suffering for another year.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:32.280
Meanwhile, but in the ecstatic portion of
my sessions, when I had stopped I was doing

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.780
this,
you know, experiencing the whole of my life

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.320
from start to finish, boom.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:43.650
Now I left all that behind and I was going
into subtle structure reality and being given

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:48.350
a crash course in cosmology, how the universe
works.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:52.000
And then we start going to lessons 25-26.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.149
I was absolutely fascinated with.

00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:59.289
I just, I was trying, but I was trying to
read into it through my own lens and filter

00:25:59.289 --> 00:26:05.279
of understanding and that was you were out
in the cosmos and you started encountering

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:14.220
vast beings, vast beings that were almost
like galaxies in of themselves.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.310
And none of us have ever seen this or felt
this or experienced this.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:23.150
Maybe just give us a glimpse into what
seemed to be the makeup of these beings,

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.059
but the thing that fascinated me was that
you said

00:26:26.059 --> 00:26:32.820
these beings live through humanity,
experienced through humanity, love through

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.140
humanity.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.289
Fill us in.

00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:41.530
I've often had kind of reservations about
that particular line in my sessions,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.350
but I kept it in because it's in my original
notes.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:52.429
When the ocean of suffering came to a culmination
and exploded me into a deeper level of consciousness,

00:26:52.429 --> 00:26:57.290
the distinctive quality of
this level of consciousness is two things.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:03.260
It was incredibly old, ancient, ancient,
beyond anything I'd ever imagined before.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.840
Very, very old.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.800
And it was more real than time and space.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:14.520
So I was being catapulted in what I eventually
came to understand as archetypal reality,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:20.289
which is a level of reality
which historically exists before time and

00:27:20.289 --> 00:27:24.779
space exist and
contributes some of the fundamental structures

00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:26.790
of time and space.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.560
So the vision here is that all of reality
emerges out of a primal one, which starts

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.640
as
a void and manifest in the form of the Big

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640
Bang.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.549
But in between the one and even the Big Bang,
there are many gradations of being,

00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:43.539
many unfoldings that take place of the divine.

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:48.279
Though I don't like to use that word because
we have so many connotations of the divine.

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:50.390
I want to go with that.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:57.529
And there are many, many layers and our
lower levels are sourced in the actions of

00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:59.950
higher levels.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:06.130
And so I was encountering these, I don't know
whether to call them beings or principles,

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.029
but vast, vast beings.

00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:14.070
Other people have experienced them too,
because I think it's a universal structure

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.390
we're bumping into.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:22.039
The very best my mind could do to give it
form was to see them as galaxies because

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:26.510
I've watched the Hubble telescope in the James
Webb.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:30.279
And we see these galaxies that are billions
and billions of light years across.

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:33.190
So big we can't even imagine them.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:39.169
And my mind was using those images just to
give a picture to these beings that were not

00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:43.220
galaxies, but they have that massive scale.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:50.890
And these beings were part of the process
of creation, creating the time and space and

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.410
some of the structures within time and space.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:57.690
And far, far, far down the line, we have human
beings.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:04.220
And the insight here was that in some way,
all of human beings

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:10.519
and actually all of existence was an expression
of the intentions

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:15.570
of these deeper cosmological principles and
cosmological beings.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:21.179
In some way, I'm not sure that I got all of
the pieces lined up correctly there,

00:29:21.179 --> 00:29:26.980
but I do think that all of human experience,
male,

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:35.000
female, all versions of human experience are
aspects of a species intelligence.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.399
And that species intelligence is an aspect
of

00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:44.340
a planetary intelligence, which is an aspect
of a solar system and a galactic intelligence.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:53.399
And there is a way in which these deeper
intelligences manifest as our lives and they

00:29:53.399 --> 00:29:59.280
are
experiencing the world as we experience the

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.630
world and
they're experiencing the adventures that we

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.480
are having as we have them.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:10.160
So that would bring us to the question then
that our experiences and again, we're looking

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.270
at everything.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:15.520
We're all watching this through our mind,
through an egoic lens, all the filters of

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.659
our past.

00:30:16.659 --> 00:30:20.419
So each one of us is hearing this the way
we will hear it.

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:27.679
But it makes us wonder if we're kind of the
end toward the end result of these vast systems

00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:32.529
of consciousness, intelligence, desire and
creativity, how much of what we're expressing

00:30:32.529 --> 00:30:35.030
in the world is sovereign at all.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:42.730
Well, you know, when I experienced this
embeddedness in these higher orders of creation,

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:49.179
I never experienced it in any way being manipulative,
and I never experienced it as

00:30:49.179 --> 00:30:56.130
being representing a compromise of my individual
agenda, individual freedom.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:08.640
I experienced this downward flow of causation,
but as part of a profound, gracious, compassionate,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.880
intelligent process which was giving me and
all

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.919
of us opportunities to grow and develop that
we

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:17.230
might not otherwise have.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:23.399
So it was, we live in
a conditioned universe at levels upon levels

00:31:23.399 --> 00:31:25.720
upon levels,
and at the same time, it's a creative

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.030
universe which is constantly manifesting new
levels,

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:33.070
new things emerging out of our fundamental
deep structure.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:41.279
And I just experienced this as I was seeing
a complexity that had always been there,

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:43.059
but I had not appreciated before.

00:31:43.059 --> 00:31:46.799
So whatever is happening has always been the
way it's happening.

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:51.950
It says that we're beginning to be aware of
what's happening.

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:52.950
Thank you.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.779
It gives us, each one of us, we could just
go over this

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:58.809
piece over and over and try to get our minds
around the vastness of it.

00:31:58.809 --> 00:32:01.559
Thank you for that,
and also for sharing that it was filled with

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:02.559
grace.

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:05.419
I very much appreciate that part of the story.

00:32:05.419 --> 00:32:10.701
And another one we move on to is
purification through reincarnation, but we're

00:32:10.701 --> 00:32:15.649
looking at
groups of people, tribal, epoch periods of

00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:21.450
history are involved when we're looking at
reincarnation, purification through

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.559
reincarnation as groups of people throughout
history.

00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:28.000
Can you just talk about what that looks like
a little bit?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.950
Well, my focus was not on groups of people,
but on all of humanity.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:37.299
When I moved into the archetypal domain,
I moved into first an inguent counter with

00:32:37.299 --> 00:32:39.350
these cosmic archetypes.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.390
And then I was dropped down into what you
might

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:45.880
call more of a Jungian level of archetypal
reality,

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:51.820
where I experienced all of humanity
repeatedly as a single organism.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.039
And I was shown,
given many lessons over the next year,

00:32:56.039 --> 00:33:01.650
that each of our minds were like a fractal
spark within a species mind.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:07.779
Each of our bodies were
cells within an integrated body of humanity.

00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:10.389
And
so there was a continuous flowback system

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:14.840
between
from the whole of humanity into the specificity

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.710
of each of us individually.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:21.230
And then the choices that we were making were
flowing back into the

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:26.559
collective, very similar to Rupert Sheldrake's
Morphic Fields theory.

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:30.789
We tend to incarnate during different periods
of history to purify

00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:33.539
a previous period of history, but we're doing
it together.

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:37.630
We're doing it as a species,
you know, and as almost soul and tribal

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.270
geographic groups.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:44.539
One of the things that happened in this
period is that I began to experience, have

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:48.110
certain
visionary experiences of the entire human

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:52.289
species
incarnating as a single organism.

00:33:52.289 --> 00:33:56.390
And each of our
individual lives were cells within that organism.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.200
Previously, and I had written a book on
reincarnation, previously, I had always thought

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.320
of reincarnation as a story of the individual
soul's journey towards enlightenment.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:12.730
But now,
I saw all of our individual journeys, an aspect

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.879
of its collective journey.

00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:20.690
And so what each of us
were dealing with was not just personal, it

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.200
was also collective.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.129
It wasn't just this century,
it was an expression of something taking place

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:27.839
in a larger pattern.

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:34.570
And I think I was given this
teaching, which went on for a long time, years,

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:38.460
in order to prepare me for what was beginning
to unfold,

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:43.859
which is this deep revision of
the where humanity is in its evolutionary

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:47.050
story,
challenges we're beginning to face, and the

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:51.480
death and rebirth and the birth of the next
iteration

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.310
of human consciousness, soul consciousness,
diamond soul.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.369
We're going to get to the diamond
soul in just a moment.

00:34:57.369 --> 00:35:00.380
I just have one more
question I wanted to ask you before that,

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.770
because
this is a big one for a lot of people watching

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:03.770
this.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.040
You had assumptions about reincarnation,
we all have assumptions about everything.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.260
You
were learning, you know, this has been your

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.430
life's
path is studying this.

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:15.770
One of the things many
people watching this have in common with what

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:22.190
your previous belief was, is that to reach
oneness is the end of the road.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:26.380
The notion of oneness is
the end of the journey.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:32.810
Can you tell us what you
discovered when you finally found that oneness?

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:34.430
Oneness is a profound truth.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:38.930
I mean, it is an
absolutely foundational, profound truth, which

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:45.430
is kind of a seminal understanding that runs
through all the world's spiritual traditions.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:51.820
It's kind of a bedrock, because oneness brings
us in touch with our essential nature, which

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.560
is
underneath the variability of our surface

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.650
nature.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.369
Oneness generates deep compassion.

00:36:00.369 --> 00:36:03.160
When you have
experienced oneness, you are naturally going

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.040
to be
gentle with everyone around you, including

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040
yourself.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.329
You'll be compassionate beyond measure.

00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:13.569
And
to experience oneness is a profound step in

00:36:13.569 --> 00:36:15.370
our spiritual journey.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.550
But I don't think it's the end step.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:23.680
Sometimes the end step is described as
dissolving into the primal void that precedes

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.600
even the manifestation of the physical universe.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.970
But in my experience, even that is not the
end step.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.030
Should I give one comment that you made?

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.740
You said it does not exhaust all cosmological
truths.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.740
Yes.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.740
Yeah.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:44.470
And oneness is a profound
stage in our development, but the universe

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.780
has
been evolving for 13.7 billion years.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.590
It's going to continue to be evolving
for billions and billions and billions of

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.590
years.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.990
An individual and a species awakening to the
truth of oneness,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.880
that's a profound turning point for that individual
in

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.650
the species life.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:05.490
But the evolution continues,
challenges continue.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.840
It's not simply that
we achieve oneness, we awaken, become spiritually

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.829
realized, and we leave the planet, we leave
the

00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:16.840
system and go into some type of off-planet
paradise.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.589
Oneness is a profound stage in our journey.

00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:22.170
I would start sounding like science fiction
if

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.021
I were to try to share some of the things
that

00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:29.190
I've been shown about the magnificent being
that

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.890
human humanity is evolving into.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:35.990
Please go there,
this audience is open to science fiction.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:42.480
The future human, which I think we are giving
the process of giving birth to in history,

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.060
the form
I've described it as the birth of the diamond

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.110
soul.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.030
This is a, the future human is not simply
a

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:57.220
human being with an open heart, a healed heart,
and an expanded heart, which holds the entire

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.380
world in compassion.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:04.819
And it's not just an open mind,
which is able to take in and enter into

00:38:04.819 --> 00:38:07.180
deeper communion with the intelligence of
the

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:12.329
cosmos and incarnate that intelligence within
their own being.

00:38:12.329 --> 00:38:16.190
But it actually transforms the fundamental
physiology

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:20.900
of our body and our a sensory experience.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:26.010
We have a tendency to have
mechanistic understanding of sensation.

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:30.640
The eyes, light comes in, brain processes,
senses, touch.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.579
It's kind of very mechanical, but in my
experience in the sessions, it's not quite

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:37.180
that simple.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.510
The more conscious we are and the more
conscious we consolidate, and I'm talking

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.630
about not
consciousness, which is collected over

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.900
experience over thousands and thousands of
years,

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:53.030
but the more consciousness we consolidate,
it not only heals our heart and opens our

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:58.250
mind,
it enlivens senses so that our eyes are in

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.130
the process,
our visual experiences in the process

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:07.060
of becoming hundreds of times more sensitive
than normal today.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:12.319
Our taste, our touch, our sexuality,
all the physical senses are in the process

00:39:12.319 --> 00:39:14.160
of
being transformed.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.880
And if we ask how far can this go?

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.369
You had an experience where you didn't understand
what was going on,

00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:24.920
as I recall when I read the book,
where you were looking at something,

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.520
but it didn't look as you normally saw it.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.390
I think you were looking at your hands.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.510
Is that correct?

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:35.450
It was the very last session that was the
73rd session,

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:41.720
and I was at the end stage of that
session about five hours in, and I was given

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.119
an experience that I came to call Diamond
Vision.

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:47.690
All of a sudden, my vision was a thousand
times

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:50.050
sharper than I'd ever known it to be.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.420
I could see things,
I could discriminate colors and shades and

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.420
textures.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:40:00.700
I was looking at my hands and I was able
to see every pore at the base of every hair

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.700
follicle.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.280
I mean, it was just amazingly detailed.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.280
I could
see dust floating in the air with great precision.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.849
I could count leaves on a tree.

00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:14.119
And then after
about 10 minutes, it disappeared.

00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:17.749
And I was back
to my ordinary, perfectly focused vision.

00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:20.020
And
that's when I understood that I was seeing

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.971
through
the eyes of the future human, that the future

00:40:22.971 --> 00:40:27.200
human is a transformation of our physical
sensations

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.940
of our entire, so our entire existence is
being polished, evoked, brought forward into

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:38.060
deeper
forms of manifestation by the universe.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.240
This is so beautiful.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.710
And that was, as I recall,
it was sessions 71 through 73, where you were

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:47.170
shown
that this human being, this vehicle,

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.860
is designed for rapid transformation.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:56.090
And please expand on that
a moment before we come toward our close here.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:41:03.420
Well, in the 70th vision, I was given what
I consider the last great vision of my journey.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.410
After that, it was kind of wrapping it up.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:09.220
But
in that journey, I was taken deeply into deep

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:14.090
time
and given three core experiences.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:20.170
And one of
those experiences was an insight into how

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:24.089
it is
that humanity is actually built, designed

00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:27.040
for
accelerated evolution.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.160
And it's basically we have
the surface of our being is reincarnation,

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:36.589
we incarnate, we learn, we grow, we change,
we make decisions, we incarnate again, different,

00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:38.040
this is that part.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.470
But underneath the incarnate,
there are incarnating self, there is a deeper

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:47.170
structure,
which holds all of our incarnational memories,

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:53.510
and is the fundamental blueprint,
in a sense, from within which we act and behave.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.810
So that all of humanity is growing and
changing, growing and changing.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:02.829
And there is a structure
to the collective psyche, a very specific

00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:05.840
structure, which is accumulating and storing
all

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.440
this information while we change individually,
this

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.200
deeper than individual structure is holding
it.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.450
And periodically, that deeper structure goes
through a change of a pivot.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:20.950
It's what I call
a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:21.950
psyche.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:24.869
I think it's the genius of creation that we
learn at

00:42:24.869 --> 00:42:29.210
an individual level, but it collects at a
deeper level.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.849
And periodically, that deeper level changes.

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:38.849
And after that shift takes place,
all individual experience is based on that

00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:41.080
changed
fundamental psyche.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.590
So that after we go
through the birth of the future human, all

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:48.250
future
incarnations of all beings, all human

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.579
beings, will be operating out of transform
this new

00:42:51.579 --> 00:42:54.220
fundamental collective psyche.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.630
And it's going to continue,
it doesn't stop.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:01.349
So individuals learn and grow,
it's collected at a deeper level,

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:06.920
and that deeper level learns and grow like
Rupert Sheldrake talks about morphogenic fields.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.869
And it's an ongoing, continually evolving
process.

00:43:11.869 --> 00:43:14.160
And you know, I've interviewed many, many
people

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.190
over the last 20 years in this particular
role.

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:22.890
And I do also interview people who channel
other beings from other times in spaces.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:26.030
And one thing that has come up repeatedly
is that

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:29.559
what humanity is moving toward, it's a total
overlay

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:36.590
with what you're saying, is to this expansive
being, this refined being that incarnates

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:39.859
into
the physical body, who's operating through

00:43:39.859 --> 00:43:43.690
the heart center, as the primary influence
of

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:44.690
intelligence.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:50.770
And that we, this is a species
that can end up and will end up being a model

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.980
for other species throughout the universes.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:57.790
Is that how you saw it too, once we can embody
all of this?

00:43:57.790 --> 00:44:03.079
You know, there was just one
piece, one line in all of the sessions that

00:44:03.079 --> 00:44:05.319
seemed
to indicate something like that.

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:12.910
What I intuited was that Earth was a hothouse,
a form of consciousness that would in time

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:17.580
be exported to other solar systems in our
galaxy.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:20.950
I don't think we're the origin of all life.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.200
And I'm sure that there is evolution taking
place

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.720
in highly developed forms in all sorts of
solar systems

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.130
and other galaxies.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:34.880
But at least here, we seem to be growing something
which is destined, it seemed to me, just that

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:39.390
one inclination seems to be destined for more
than planet Earth.

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.550
Well, I just wanted
to say you have validation there from other

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.800
sources
who have given that information through to

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:46.800
us.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.800
It's a while getting there.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.800
We just have to trip
through these times.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.400
Again, I can't thank you
enough for the courage it took you.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.859
We didn't
talk about what you went through, but I mean,

00:44:56.859 --> 00:45:00.829
we're
talking about life wrecking consequences of

00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:04.410
taking
such high doses of LSD that you say now was

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.630
really insane to have done, but you didn't
know any better.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:08.660
You lived through it.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.300
Thank God, because it really pushed you out
there.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.170
I truly do not, I do not recommend it.

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.550
I'd be much gentler if I were doing it again.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:23.770
And I recommend a gentler protocol if you're
going to work with psychedelics.

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:24.770
Yes, yes.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:26.900
And you say that repeatedly in the book.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.880
So I recommend for people to.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.480
really dive into this
We just touched a few places in the book.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.190
There's so much more connective tissue to
this story of the human,

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.660
the collective human being.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.809
And any final thoughts
you want to leave us with today before we

00:45:43.809 --> 00:45:44.809
sign off?

00:45:44.809 --> 00:45:54.030
First, I want to thank you for helping bring
the message from this work forward.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:56.609
Psychedelics is simply a protocol.

00:45:56.609 --> 00:45:59.590
It's a new methodology for accessing these
deep states

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:04.099
of consciousness,
but it's simply a modern version.

00:46:04.099 --> 00:46:09.650
We have many protocols that have been accessing
these deep states of consciousness.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:10.910
Psychedelics
are not important.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:13.510
They're not the
signature of this work.

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:15.309
They're simply an amplifier.

00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:17.630
It's consciousness that does the work.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:23.410
It's consciousness that if we use these sessions
skillfully, it's consciousness that really

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:26.160
does the work that opens us to these things.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.660
So I would really, at the end,
I would de-emphasize the psychedelics and

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.839
emphasize
the consciousness which psychedelics amplify

00:46:34.839 --> 00:46:37.200
And there are many ways to reach that.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.349
Again, Christopher, thank you so much.

00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:44.660
And I look forward to meeting you in the flesh
in the Gaia Studios where we'll go over this,

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:48.650
but start filling in some of the pieces
we weren't able to get to today.

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:49.650
Okay?

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:50.650
Thank you, Regina.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:51.750
And I look forward to that too.

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.750
Thank you.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:54.849
So everybody, again,
the title of the book is

00:46:54.849 --> 00:46:59.200
LSD and the Mind of the Universe,
Christopher Bache.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.359
And I can't recommend it highly enough.

00:47:02.359 --> 00:47:06.559
It'll take you to places that you never dreamed
existed.

00:47:06.559 --> 00:47:09.290
So until next time, thank you for joining
us here on

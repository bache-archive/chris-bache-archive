      <p>so thank you all for joining I will give a short outline of tonight that you know we have two and a half hours together which is a great amount of time and you will see the time will pass as fast as you entered now so um tonight we start with an achievement a meditation to just settle in with the theme we um yeah we just programmed for this for this wisdom Keepers Gathering um and of course we're gonna we're gonna look ahead to uh the upcoming uh hour to hour and a half with Chris and Dwayne so what are their backgrounds and why they're here and you're gonna see they're coming from two different angles two different perspectives two different um paradigms I would say and this is a beautiful dance we're gonna encounter what are the possibilities especially creating a new mindset as humans a mindset of the whole universe because it's not about the technical logical evolution of the world leaders you're going to create a diminishing of greenhouse gases you're going to drive your electric car you're gonna put more trees in the ground you are more kind to your neighbors where that's the start where the mindset starts and after on an hour and a half a dance with Chris and Dwayne sounds like music in my ears um we have the last 45 minutes half an hour to look ahead for creating more circles as a as a community as a human family to create and to practice this new mindset so we're gonna we're gonna guide you through this step by step and um please sit in your comfortable chair have a good evening and before we start I would like you to close your eyes trust us

open up your eyes and going external to all people who joined this Gathering feel free to make some contact with the people look at the thumbnails the faces and before we're gonna introduce Chris and Dwayne I want to thank you um for all the donations there are a beautiful amount of the donations done as a gift for the choosing life project we're gonna hear more about it from from Dwayne I think uh so thank you for that and I also want to take a moment to introduce Mayo my co-host during the wisdom keepers every month and I want to say that also Melanie is one of the the hosts but she can't contribute tonight because she has a course running so Mayo before we go to Dwayne and Chris and we're going to open up please feel free to share something from your site your microphone is still off um everyone thank you so much for taking the time for being here with us can you hear me now fantastic it is so important to have these conversations within ourselves but imagine the power of sharing our ideas and connecting from a human stance and these conversations although they're mediated through this platform right it's technology that is provided us this sense of community even though we may be continents away or as boss's beautiful depiction of our neighborhood in our house and wherever we may be this what we are doing and what we just did to that guided meditation is truly Beyond it is combining our energies into one Essence into this Consciousness so it is so important to have this meeting to have more conversations in your neighborhoods with those around you so that you can share your reality and how we can co-create that reality together so thank you so much for being here we look forward to Growing With You to having perhaps a a meeting that is face to face one day a wisdom Keepers face to face but for now let's sit tight and enjoy the ride tonight's competitions are going to be very much expanding our universe into what we can do as human beings here now and today so that we can come together as one species in order for us to thrive as a whole so thank you so much for being here taking the time thank you Maya um yes before we're going to start um with Chris and Dwayne we're going to introduce them of course and I'm going to also highlight why we are here together also with Chris and Dwayne um I invite you if you have the feeling you want to write something down something like a question something like something coming up an emotion or something you feel in your system you want to write it down feel comfortable to do so um it's handy at the second part of the wisdom keeps Gathering that we have a q a and a sharing part where these things can be shared and feel open to do so and feel that this environment is reliable and you can trust this environment so we're here with a good heart that's what I want to say we were gonna see if we're gonna use a whiteboard to share all our information or to have more like an integration of uh the things coming up uh we're just gonna feel uh organically if this is going to happen so if I'm going to show up a whiteboard I'm gonna explain how we're gonna use the Whiteboard but we're gonna see okay um before um this idea of asking initially Chris and afterwards Dwayne came up as well in my mind in our minds and it's it's a beautiful coincidence they're both at this Gathering and would like to introduce them both uh from from the heart um and From perspective but I want to say something personal because since I started I'm I'm I'm I'm a background medical doctor and ENT doctor train ENT doctor and then I'm more like opening up which is I think more like a calling into into life more in uh Integrative Medicine and now I'm into the Grove Legacy training for uh trans person psychology and psychedelic therapy and that's where I met Chris uh Chris I was at your beautiful course from The Shift Network LSD in the mind of the universe and it opens something up about how are we going to take care of this planet and of this universe because it's all integrated and it's all uh it's a one life system or one or a whole world system so that's thank you for that that's what I want to share personally and it um until now and after my own psychedelic experiences it's getting deeper and deeper and feels like we're creating a tribe where these important things can be shared but it's creating a mind shift by itself so thank you for that and maybe it's it's beautiful to start with You Chris because the initial Outreach for us um via email to you and then Dwayne craymond uh Chris your professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious study and your specialized in the buddhistic studies of the Youngstown State University but you're also related to the California Institute of integral studies and also in the advisory Council of my training Grove Legacy training uh I know you're also related to The Institute of noetic Sciences so you're you're not retired or Emirates uh professor at all your full uh alive and contributing to the Mind shift which is which is happening uh you're an author of several books uh the latest um it's on my desk every day and I would really recommend if you're not in LSD or you're not if psychedelics you have to read it because it's it's very much important information which is in the book you wrote several books I'm not going to highlight them all but LSD in the mind of the universe your latest book and for me it was transformative so thank you for that um and in this book you described your Empirical research you did it on your own with your former wife um with 76 deep high-dose LSD sessions in which you entered the the non-holiday states of Consciousness and you encountered a vision of our impending Global crisis and also the birth of the future humans so these Visions are of importance because this comes from a field which we are not so much aware of it this is beautiful information so thank you for being here and thank you for contributing to uh to this Gary it's a pleasure to be here boss and then Dwayne um during the course of Chris LSD in the mind of the Universe um you already mentioned Chris Dwayne's work and after the course I went through it and your last book Dwayne um choosing Earth was mind-blowing for me it's so full of information and you're an author of several books which are all important for us humans but choosing Earth and you can find in the chat box already the link to choosing Earth's website and also the book and you can just download it by PDF so thank you for that thank you for opening up Dwayne um in the early 70s you worked as a senior staff of the member of the presidential Congressional Commission on the American future of yeah of the of the the last uh 30 years of the last century so the 70s until 2000 an important position and you were also acknowledged for this deep work as a social visionary exploring the deeper trends that are transforming our world and you will recognize for this for an international award a peace award a recognition of this this global vision and consciousness of lifestyle that contributes to our more sustainable and spiritual culture so it's an honor having you here um I would like to open up the field for you both to to start with our yeah main question of the evening how can we create as humans um a new mindset which transforms our Global crisis or can we can we transform the global crisis or have do we have to go through it with a new mindset so can we start from there and then we'll see how the dance will evolve thank you for being here you both it's a pleasure to be here everyone Buzz thank you for the invitation you hear my voice is a little rough I've just come down with the cold I would have canceled except this material is just too important uh to let go of the opportunity to talk about it and I wouldn't pass up an opportunity to to talk with Dwayne I'd have to be near dead to pass up this opportunity we've been friends for oh over 20 years 25 years now and uh it was first our research and our writing which brought us together but then as we got to know each other personally and understood the human being behind the research the Friendship has just deepened into a deep lifelong Brotherhood now how Dwayne and I have thought about today is basically first of all I want to say a talk is just an opportunity to get to the Q a because the Q a is where the juice really is and I'm really looking forward to that that part of our discussion and I know Dwayne is too but in terms of the talk we see this as basically a conversation an opportunity for Dwayne and I just to to sink into conversation and have the kind of conversation that we have Sometimes When We Get Together um and so I thought we might Begin by just kind of affirming some common ground that Dwayne and I share first on I'm a philosopher of religion I've been an academic all my life and in in Northeast Ohio Dwayne is a a social activist a Visionary social activist we've both written books we've both been completely committed to our lives project and we both share coming at it through overlapping means we both share I think a common vision of the universe that can be reached intellectually and can be reached experientially and that is a vision of the universe that is saturated with intelligence orders and orders and Orders of intelligence and also the intelligence behind the Manifest Universe the intelligence out of which the universe sprang in the Big Bang and continues to unfold and be nourished by this fertile ground of existence this is common ground for Dwayne and I also common ground is the sense that our East our nature our Consciousness if you just sit quietly or if you amplify Consciousness if you sink into Consciousness you sink into your personal unconsciousness and then you sink into what Jung call the collective unconscious and if you just keep going you sink eventually into a level levels of consciousness so deep they go beyond the species they go beyond time and space and one can enter into deep communion with I think what both of us think of as the mind of the universe both the Manifest universe and the universe behind that manifests the universe and Dwayne and I both share the conviction that this intelligence is profoundly wise he asked me before we got started how would you describe the IQ of the universe boy that was that stumped me for a bit and I had to think in terms of an IQ on the order of millions and billions because I mean look at this is the the intelligence which has manifested everything we see around us as far as we can see and as deep as we can see how could we possibly measure the depth of that of that uh intelligence and compassion and that's a kind of gets to the tricky Point part because it's easy enough to see the the intelligence when we just look at DNA and we look at the structure of stars and galaxies we can see layers and layers of intelligence manifesting but compassion on the surface life is hard life is and one could easily conclude and I understand you could conclude that me life is basically generated by a mean son of a I mean it hurts us so much it it just hurts so terribly and in order to see the wisdom of the universe and to see the compassion behind this the hard conditions in which we live you have to look very deep you have to look much deeper than sensory Consciousness you have to much deeper than the workings of the personal and Collective psyche you really must look very very deep deeply I think it was ramakrishna when he was asked um when he said once in order to see God you must be willing to look evil in the face and in order to see the wisdom of the universe you must be willing to sit deeply with the pain of existence and there's nothing Dwayne or I will say today that would dilute set aside sublimate or in any way side step the Deep suffering that it takes to live fully an embodied spiritual existence right so this is just a warm-up exercise and I what I want to do is toss it to Dwayne and we're going to toss it back and forth and then we're going to move towards this topic of the times that we're living in the crisis that we are coming into the depth of that crisis and what we might do to move through this crisis with courage and to actually accelerate our way through it so we can get through it within with intelligence and with compassion and exploring what the universe wants of humanity at this hour what Humanity what the universe is inviting Humanity to become because both of us share the vision that we are coming to a trigger point a triggering point we're coming to a bifurcation point where Humanity either makes the next step in its long evolutionary Journey or we probably go extinct because we can't survive on this planet in these conditions staying at the level of Consciousness that has brought us here we either grow up as Twain says or we die and that means this Extinction or potential Extinction is an enormous evolutionary accelerator so with that let me hand it over to my brother Dwayne thank you brother Chris uh Chris is one of my dearest dearest brothers and friends and I am so grateful for the lifelong uh the journey that we've shared with our mutual interests depth looking at the nature of the universe and where that is leading us as we move into this dangerous and transformative time for Humanity and creative time and the um the passions that are present are really come passions the presence of suffering in the world is a catalyst for our pushing back on ourselves and Awakening freshly uh to where we are and where we might be going uh from here so um I appreciated boss saying that he was a Doctor by training and early on in my life I was going to become a doctor but I encountered the violence of the Vietnam era and I shifted over a period of time from physical healing to now social healing and uh that's one theme I would really like to explore and underneath the social healing is our connection with the aliveness of a living universe and that is where Chris and I have found common ground and common uh passion in our mutual explorations of that possibility that reality so um let's let's begin Chris right where do you want to start dig in well um I think it's important just to acknowledge where we are right now that the crisis of transition isn't something that's in the future it is happening right now um the head of the United Nations uh recently said um humanity is on a climate Highway to Hell we're on a climate Highway to Hell and that's just looking at the climate crisis uh we're also on a an extraordinary uh path of extincting a huge proportion of the plant and animal species on this Earth it's estimated by the end of this Century a million species different species a million species will be extinct we're impoverishing the Earth right now it's extraordinary uh we're also in a time of overshoot we're way uh overshooting the resource base of the earth we can't continue as we have it's estimated that the Earth will carry roughly uh 2 billion people uh into the far future and right now we have eight billion people so if we take that to heart it means that we're roughly 6 billion people over the carrying capacity of the earth and so we are in for a rough ride a rough initiation if you will moving from our current condition of overshoot and collapse the extinction of species the climate catastrophe resource depletion and all the rest and come to some new healing and some new healthy relationship uh with the Earth and uh and our ability to live into the far future so that's a yeah let me ask you a question that I know is on people's mind and I know your answer to it I suspect but the question is this can we avoid this crisis now if we really get off our butt and mobilize can we stop what's happening and uh bring this under control what do you think no it's uh too late uh had we started a half century ago when I began my research on all of this in the early 1970s there was an opportunity that time to pull back take a look at where we were headed and choose a new pathway but we have used up that half century uh to just consume ourselves into a corner if you will and so now we're up against it and we do have the forces the factors that I was just mentioning overshoot of the Earth's resource base a climate catastrophe that's growing Reese uh the species being extincted at an extraordinary rate and so on and so on now is the time for our decision now is the time for choice and um so this is where we're looking at at this not as theoretically in the far future but as right now we're up against it and and now is the time for a new understanding of who we are where are we who are we where are we going from here those are the core things we need to begin digging into now not only philosophically but but practically realistically as a species so let's begin that inquiry yes and the depth of the destabilization that's coming at us has already started we see a deep unraveling in many areas of the social fabric we see our political discourse becoming increasingly polarized we're moving in the direction of fascism on one side uh totalitarianism on other sides repression of discourse denial of facts of science it's getting harder and harder to to assume any kind of common ground which are all symptoms I think of the fact that the ground is Shifting out from underneath our feet it's like we're in a slow-moving earthquake that's building up year by year and it's just shaking our systems to its foundations and if you're if you just look at the research as Dwayne has done and many of you have done if you look at the research you can just see that the foundations of our culture are just going are shaking beginning to shake more and more and we're going to live through this Our Generation my children's generation your children's generation your grandchildren's generation it will still be deepening during these decades ahead it's hard to Envision just how bad it's going to get when I think about this my heart explodes with pain everyone I sit with who really looks hard at the data their heart explodes in pain and they would do anything to not have to go through this but this is what we're this is what we're going into and that means I think it's particularly important that we understand what is happening that because if we don't understand this at a deep structural level if we don't understand the evolutionary challenge that we're facing we're going to give way to despair we're going to give way to theodices which are which are really deeply demonic and problematic we're going to give way to a political uh destructive philosophies so we have to understand this deeply I'll pass it to you brother yes okay here's what I I have encountered over the last oh roughly 40 years uh speaking to people around the Earth and often before I give a talk I will ask an audience a Sim one simple question and the question is this if you look at the entire Human family and you look at our behaviors what is the life stage of the Human family being expressed by those behaviors and I give an audience four possibilities one that we're behaving like toddlers two that were behaving like teenagers like adolescents three that were behaving like early adults and four like Elders four possibilities toddlers teenagers adults or elders and I've asked this and I've been very surprised that around the earth it doesn't matter who I speak with it might be a church group it might be a college audience it might be a business community and so on it doesn't matter one response comes back again and again and again roughly three quarters of every audience I've spoken to over decades has one response and they say we're behaving like adolescents and like teenagers there's no hesitation regarding that that answer and so if we are in our adolescent stage as a species what will it take us to move then into our early adulthood and in many ways that's what we're looking at right now the fire of initiation that will push us into a new sense of ourselves a new sense of of the universe in which we live and a new sense importantly of The evolutionary journey in which we're involved so um that is one key framing for me it's that we're in a rite of passage it's it's a time of initiation of our species and all the suffering all the pain that we're experiencing right now as a part of that pain that every adolescent as an individual goes through in different ways but nonetheless we we don't move into our early adulthood without going through the fire of initiation and so okay let's accept that that is how Evolution Works uh we are pushed outside of the nest of our comfort zone and into this transforming future and as an extraordinary future that lies before us and without a sense of where we might be going we're going to be reluctant to go there so one thing I appreciate about Chris and his look at his exploration of the birth of the future human and my own work that's what we're looking at what is the maturation of the species about where does that take us in terms of our relationship with the universe our relationship with other humans our relationship deeply within ourselves so that's a conversation that Chris and I have had again and again over the years so clear Chris your turn to give a deeper context to Dwayne's observations I want to point to his second book Awakening Earth where he describes the the the stages of human evolution in terms of the conscious capacities or the levels of consciousness that human beings have evolved over our long evolutionary story and I think if I have this right Dwayne you correct me you say in the book and by the way if you get the book read the book start at the epilogue read the epilogue first and then read the book because the epilogue gives you the ex experiential insight into where the book came from but late in the book he says we could go through these last three evolutionary stages in as little as 500 years and given that we're talking about tens and hundreds of thousands of years leading up to that point we're talking about that would represent an enormous acceleration an exponential acceleration that we're entering into so very intense but exponentially sped up yes Wayne indeed we're moving into a time obviously of intense compression this is going to be a heated Journey a heated compression of humanity uh in the fire of initiation that we're already beginning to experience right now as we look beyond our nation-state boundaries to the Earth as a whole system and we're seeing this will not hold this will not carry us even to the end of this Century so uh we are in compression times and we are going to be pushed outside of our our usual circumstances and uh and and into new conditions as a species not simply as Nations uh but as a species as a whole and that's already beginning to happen right now and so that will be the Catalyst I think for Rapid acceleration of The evolutionary potentials that are already surfacing and and this Gathering is one expression of that the rule of psychedelics for example and being a catalyst for awakening us to a new uh domain of understanding of ourselves and the human Journey so um here we go as a species Into the Fire and into the initiation and hopefully into our higher Humanity yeah and in that context I want to put on the table one fundamental Axiom of my thought I know Dwayne shares this Axiom and I suspect probably everyone in this group does too and that's the concept of reincarnation and so this was my first book on which I chose to write on reincarnation starting with the empirical evidence which I believe is just overwhelming and I came to this conclusion as a philosopher of religion so when I look at the world and I see human beings I don't see them the way that most people see them I don't see old people as old people and young people as young people I tend to see souls and there are old souls and small young bodies and there are young souls in Old withered bodies but the important key here is understanding that Evolution that reincarnation is is a higher order of evolution it's one of the fundamental truths of a self-manifesting self-evolving universe and so far we've been telling the story of of reincarnation saturated by the perspective of theologies and philosophies which have been individually oriented so we tell the story of reincarnation in terms of individual Evolution the Soul's Evolution over countless lifetimes the Soul's Awakening eventually into individual Enlightenment but it's basically been strapped to a metaphysics which focuses on individual individual human beings and that's not that that's false I think that's really true but we're missing something deeply if we think if we stop there when we understand that not just we and everyone we see around us is evolving but every human being on the planet is a reincarnating essence then we begin to understand that reincarnation is a collective driver it is not just an individual driver it's not just about personal salvation or personal transformation it is an evolutionary Drive of the highest magnitude and I'll shift just for a second and say if you ever read my book diamonds from heaven or as a publisher named it LSD in the mind of the universe there's a section there where I report I record the experiences that kept opening up and tearing me open and showing me the entire universe the entire species pulsing in and out of time space every hundred years or so just the entire species pulsing and evolving together all of our individual karmic agendas being woven skillfully intelligently into a collective karmic agenda and the collective karmic agenda be informing all of our individual karmic agendas so that it became impossible to separate the evolution of the individual and the evolution of the collective and that became one of the fundamental core themes of my second book Dark Knight early Dawn where I'm talking about the Dark Knight not of the individual soul of the indiv you know the Dark Knight that the Mystic goes through before Spiritual Awakening but the dark night of our Collective Soul so that we I began to understand for my sessions that all of our individual work serves not only our individual development but it also serves directly immediately our Collective development and there are no such things as personal problems which are not also Collective problems try and think of one think of any personal issue that we may be dealing with and try to find one that isn't echoed or reflective of a collective issue in our culture so I'll just pause there hand it back to you Dwayne well Chris held up a book or two I you know I I can't let that just pass without holding up one of my own and it released very directly to what Chris is speaking about right now uh that a reincarnational perspective how can that happen well here's a book that I worked on for 30 years uh the living Universe uh the universe uh according to modern science and I have encountered this so many times that is it considered non-living at the foundation's dead at the foundations and as far as modern consumer Society is concerned it's all this dead matter and empty space and people like Chris beige come along and they say wait a minute no I've I've explored the deeper reaches of the universe it's a living system in that living system life can re connect with itself it can evolve with itself and reincarnation then is is not losing the thread of our existence as we move through multiple cycles of life in this larger aliveness so we can after a bit maybe begin to explore the foundations of a living universe and that perspective uh but I I want to give Chris a chance to perhaps integrate that connect the living Universe with the uh evolution of life through that living system well in that context I just want to sort of say something which is hard and consoling at the same time and that is from a reincarnational perspective we're always popping into time space and we pop out of time space into a spiritual meta Universe we pop back into time space we pop out of time space and from this perspective what is death and all of the Enlightenment Traditions all of the you know the The Awakening Spiritual Awakening Traditions basically say the same thing birth is not the beginning of our life look carefully and you will find in your being in your physical body and in your mind the evidence of a range of experience that far predates your physical body death is not the end of our existence because we now and particularly if you study with people like Michael Newton and his work and life between life and past life therapy we have an abundance of evidence that there is a continuity of Consciousness that predates us and post dates our individual life that we so when we talk about the deaths that are coming I mean we have to really relate to it at two levels and both of them are fundamentally true and to diminish either of them I think would diminish the truth of our situation one of them is the death of a human being is a painful horrendous terrible experience we are ending a life cycle every death is the ending of a precious cycle of life and that hurts like hell and then another perspective we can also say that in a deeper perspective no one dies Cycles end Cycles begin but the Consciousness which is alive within that organism within that being is not extinguished but simply paused while we go home we recalibrate refresh rejuvenate and then we enter back into The Fray so this is on the one hand consoling because it tells us that death is not the end on the other hand if you look at it really carefully it means that this pattern of leaving our loved ones behind and coming back into new configurations and leaving and coming back into new configurations this very difficult and demanding Dynamic of constantly shredding in some ways the social fabric the family fabric our individual fabric is part of the ways that way that life's works we have to look deeply to understand and when we look deeply we begin to sort of see that the Universe thinks in very different terms than we do it thinks on a time frame much much larger than we do it's just things on a scale a completely higher order of scale we have to learn to think as we have to learn to think like a mountain we have to learn to think like the universe we have to learn to really kind of think large and think deep and look at every human being we see as a precious soul who is a companion on this long journey whatever our short-term relationship with them are underneath We Stand Together in this long evolutionary trajectory working for the collective good of our planet of the entire Human family and if people don't have this commitment to the Human family if they have only a commitment to their own personal life or they even their own personal family understandable but I feel sorry for them at a deeper level because to be committed to something large is to is to activate and to acknowledge that in ourselves which is large and therefore to be committed to your species to be committed to your generation to be committed to the planet to be committed to the other forms of life that share this planet with us these are an expression of a maturing soul a young soul is small right a maturing soul is large when we look at Gandhi Martin Luther King great Souls which hold large swaths of humanity in their heart those are the symptoms of a maturing soul right Gwen well so well said Chris um that's a part of growing up a maturing soul is to grow into the reality that we do have a soul and to keep the fire in the soul alive so that we can grow into this future that you're speaking about and I I I've often wondered why doesn't the larger World recognize what we're speaking about right here this is the wisdom that's known through history and and across cultures uh where is that uh wisdom uh today and um you know I'm I'm reminded from the American Indian tradition of three Miracles uh that's that's helped to reveal this the first miracle is that anything exists at all anything exists at all that's a miracle the second Miracle is that living things exist like plants and animals and the third Miracle is that living things exists that know they exist and that have the capacity to explore the nature of that existence now we tend to get so enamored with the third Miracle that's that really elevates uh our capacities as a species and we tend to then forget the first miracle that anything is here at all and one thing I appreciate about what Chris is doing with his life and his journey is not only speaking and learning about reincarnation and the individual soul or and our and our movement through time but also the nature of the universe that would carry that process the first miracle and uh one thing that we love to explore is the nature of the first miracle that the universe is itself a living system and and we are beginning the The evolutionary journey of learning how to live in that larger aliveness now that's an extraordinary transition from living in a dead universe and it's really dead matter empty space well what do we have here nothing more than our physical body a bit of uh biological aliveness it's here for a short time well what do we do with that emphasis short well we consume as much as we can to get as much pleasure as we can for a short while before we're thrown into the mystery of non-existence Chris is talking about a different Journey he's saying wait a minute wait a minute we're alive we're deeply alive the universe is a living system we're moving through that larger aliveness and what we're trying to do here is move beyond the consumer Society that's over consuming the earth move into a greater wisdom that says look at who you are sure you are a physical body but beyond the physical body is the body of Consciousness that lives in our living universe and that's who you are more deeply more profoundly and by growing into that whether we encounter that aliveness through the Psychedelic Journey the meditative journey and so on uh that is who we are at a more foundational level and that is what Chris is pointing to and that is what I am working with as well with my own life yeah you're pointing to me Dwayne but you know come on brother you wrote the book The Living Universe you're the one who really really spent all those years looking at the scientific evidence trying to Marshal the kind of evidence that would convince my atheistic philosophy department where they just reject all of this out of hand because they're committed to a materialist perspective and I'm presenting them evidence for reincarnation they're saying oh that's a nonsense because we know it all reduces to brain and we know where that comes from and you know you're the one who took that on and you just laid out this hammering the evidence and the evidence and then also drawing upon cross-cultural testimony from multiple continents that are basically testifying that to the deeper mystery to the deeper intelligence which we can experience yeah that's what my philosophical con colonies you know they're so skeptical about ooh experience no no no no but it's like come on I say let's Let's Get Serious a philosophical Revolution begins with the question what is it possible for a human being to experience right yes yes they're telling me you can't experience the things you say you're experiencing and I'm telling them come on I got we have a method we have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people who have used this method of done LLC Psychotherapy we've pushed these boundaries we have long now longitudinal studies that are showing us what happens when people do these things you can't dismiss that and say oh no that couldn't be real because my metaphysical view says matter is the only reality and you're talking about things that are not materially based right right yes so you know you're knocking on their door hard brother I want to bring in um look let's look Beyond philosophy because that's thinking a lot Chris uh let's look at the direct experience you know the Psychedelic experiences direct it's immediate you don't think about it you're just overwhelmed with the direct experience and encounter uh with life in a different in a different mode or different Manner and um so let me share just in a briefly um my experience in parapsychology almost half a century ago the U.S government began the very first research by the government into psychic so-called psychic potentials um and to me they're not I don't like the word psychic I like the word it's alive and to what extent can we relate to and experience the aliveness of the living universe and what does that reveal to us and there were two things that came back after three years of involvement in in-depth research there at the engineering laboratory of the Sanford Research Institute um so I had the extraordinary opportunity just extraordinary for over a three-year period funded by NASA the space agency to begin to explore our intuitive capacities and they wanted to know they said look if if there's an astronaut on The Far Side of the Moon is there any way to intuitively understand their situation uh can our intuition uh reach behind The Far Side of the Moon and get valuable and meaningful information about their condition well that was the premise that launched uh this three years of inquiry that after uh three years I dropped out because it was taken over by the CIA because it was so compelling the information coming back that it was taken over by the Central Intelligence Agency and it continued for another 20 years so but in the first three years it was public information and here's what was learned from that first is that uh there are two aspects to our our intuitive potentials one that we can receive information uh Way Beyond uh what we can reach through our uh normal perceptual capacities of the physical body and then secondly we can extend our our energetic impact on the universe Way Beyond uh the the close-in reach of our of our body as well and so the receptive side was what is sometimes called remote viewing and that was interesting but the expressive side which is sometimes called psychokinesis a mind manifesting in matter really took me into the realm of a living universe and exploring the Ecology of uh the living universe and how we can do a dance uh with that universe and and expands ourselves to our really our the larger selves that we actually inhabit and so we have a physical body but that body is a an anchor for an unbounded awareness an unbounded Consciousness that reaches out without bound into the larger universe and Beyond and so we are bounded for a short while then as Chris has mentioned that boundary gives way we the body dies with the Consciousness that was carried along through the body does not it migrates it moves into the into the larger Realms of the universe and I don't presume to know what where we're going with that but I do presume to have unshakable confidence that we are learning to live in this larger aliveness and that is the core Journey uh that we're about right now as a species and to the extent that we think what we're doing here is is learning to consume more so we can be happy with the material things that we have we're missing we're missing what this is all about we're you this is a place to learn about who we are beneath and behind and Beyond the physical body to recognize that we're a part of a journey of aliveness that as Chris has said has had infinitely deep Origins and that has infinitely deep potentials moving into the further uh future boy do I want to jump on that hard I I want to look at this idea of as we develop our potentials as we make this Turning Point as we kind of mature as a species what kind of human being are we becoming what are the potentials that we are activating and I think it's far far beyond what we are seeing even in the science fiction literature which so much looks like cops and robbers in space you know software beyond the traditional pictures but I want to hold that for a little bit and I want to build up to that little bit and so I'd like to up the ante in a different way I'd like to talk more directly about psychedelics you ready to make that pivot sure okay now this is something that both Dwayne and I share and I suspect if we had a show of hands we'd get a pretty high showing of people who have used psychedelics responsibly in this room as part of their own personal History part of their spiritual practice history just as we if we ask people how many people do yoga and I've done meditation we'd have the same type of thing for our generation psychedelics is part of the the Arsenal of spiritual of not only spiritual healing healing the soul but uh becoming more aware of what our lives are about and what life itself is about so let me just speak personally for a minute I was brand new professor fresh out of graduate school red Stan Groff's work immediately I felt like I saw my life vocation in front of me I had to do this type of work it had been made illegal this was 1978 right so it had been made illegal in 1970. I loved teaching I didn't want to lose my job so I basically developed us a sideline to my career I was a traditional in many ways not I hope not too traditional but I was an academic I was teaching courses at the University sitting on committees writing papers doing all that stuff but in my nighttime job I began a systematic course of using a psychedelic protocol that I inherited from Stan Groff totally internalized internalized sessions rigorous lying down eye shades earphones sitter all that stuff you know you know the drill unwisely I will admit now I chose a protocol after three sessions of working with very high doses of LSD because I was in a hurry and I thought this would get me where I wanted to go faster I thought it was about personal Awakening personal Enlightenment yeah come on they'll be harder but I'll burn off my karma faster let's get there let's put the metal to the pedal to the metal let's go well I turned out turns out that was completely wrong on so many points the goal was not personal Enlightenment and if you work with very very high doses like I did and you do it in a controlled burn situation in a very carefully situation when you start shattering the boundaries within a few years I was dealing with experiences where clearly what was driving my sessions and what was driving the purification and transformational process in my sessions was not my personal development it was not my personal healing or my personal transformation but my work had gotten sucked into a larger historical drama of our Collective development and so much of the healing that took place in my sessions were not about healing crispace or even crispacia's soul but it was trying to engage and heal some aspect of the Human family and for years and years has kept repeating itself entering deep into pains which are stored within the collective Collective unconscious Aggregates which are stored from all the Wars all the all the unhealed traumas of all the wars and all the abuse and all the droughts and all the men versus women violence and race versus race violence and so on and so forth all of that trauma which is not resolved at the end of any one lifetime is accumulating in the human psyche and for us to make this evolutionary pivot we have to heal Humanity we have to heal the being which for me is a single being the human species as a single being in which we are all cells in order for this entire being to make the transition that Dwayne has talked about from being an adolescent stage of the Soul development into a mature adult stage of Soul development we have to heal and healing is the first step to establish a New Foundation a new platform where we can then download deeper and more mature and richer energy and light and insight from the universe itself it's like we're we're too we're too dumb we're too fragmented to be able to take advantage of all the wisdom and all the healing that's available to us but as we heal this work as we do this work then we can take in more we can take in uh we can take in more of the light of the universe now I mentioned that just to kind of a preface to where we go when you start shattering the shells that hold our awareness in their fixed and narrow con confirmation we can shatter a shell and usually the first layers of shells people talk about ego death right the death of our individual Mind Body Experience then you wake up into you are reborn into a deeper level of Consciousness and if you push those boundaries if you work steadily at those boundaries eventually that process will do the same type of purification process you'll hit limits and you'll go through yet another death in rebirth but it's not ego death repeating itself it's a deeper kind of dying it's a dying that takes place at the species level it brings you the rebirth that takes place preaches you not into your soul level of individual Awakening but into some aspect of humanities Awakening if you continue to push hard at least it's been my experience that if you continue this process diligently and we'll talk about what that means maybe but if you do this work systematically and you really take care of your body and I don't recommend doing it the way I did it because it's a lot of wear and tear if I knew then what I know now I wouldn't do it the same way again please don't I do it differently I'd be gentler but if you push like this if you keep on pushing those boundaries you begin to enter into a communion with the intelligence that's within the species that's driving the species and it begins to teach you it teaches you what's happening it teaches you where humanity is going now at this point I'll just inject one point and I'm gonna turn it over to Dwayne again one of the things that began to happen about I don't know eight nine years into my work I began to have a series of visions that just were being poured into me and I I think of Black Elk when I try to talk about this because Black Elk when he was 12 years old he had this Visionary experience of the fate of the Lakota people and it shook him so deeply you know he he almost died he was out unconscious for days and days when he came back he was holding this Vision he was so shaken he didn't talk about it for years in my case I was downloading visions of what appeared to be the fate of the human species but it wasn't given to me all at once it was being dropped in peace and pieces over a series of sessions stretched over years and but the fundamental teaching kept repeating itself and deepening itself and the teaching was this humanity is coming to a turning point humanity is entering a very challenging period but a time of profound spiritual fruition we are entering a time that would Mark the beginning and end of History it's a truly an ethical shifting experience we were coming into a time when we would literally begin to wake up collectively and it wasn't about just individuals this is a species-wide Awakening the Dynamics are species-wide the time of individual salvation is over time of collective salvation is at our doorstep right now over and over and over again it was saying this is the massive turning point this is this is where we had been building to this transition for eons it kept showing me a future that was just ecstatic a future if you can imagine of our entire species being a species of Buddhas and Christ and Prophets totally awakened from the soul of our Center but in all these four years never told me how we were going to get there I had no Insight given how we were going to carry make this transition travel as far as we had to travel in as little time as all the research was showing telling us that we had because really right Extinction is pressing down upon us and it's coming hard and fast the crisis was moving in on us right now I share this with you because as I've talked about this and it's in the my book and in LLC in the mind of the universe and as I've talked about this I've had so many people come up to me and say I've had the same kind of Visions that's been showing me the same thing in my deep meditation practice we're coming to a turning point this is a driving force this is a social Collective for us so there's nothing private there's nothing personal about this experience it's not my unique experience I'm simply witnessing to something which many of us have been experiencing and I know that you've been experiencing experience that type of material Dwayne yes indeed yeah well uh let me summarize from from my perspective what we've been speaking about and uh three elements of the come up of that summary uh we're a world a species that's not really recognizing what's going on here um first of all we're not recognizing the nature of the universe in which we live uh the universe is a living system and uh current sign says no it's this dead matter in empty space and we're ready to work with the material dimensions of it all and so on and so on but the deeper aliveness is not recognized uh secondly we don't recognize Who We Are we think well okay we're biological beings and this dead universe and we're making the best of it in a consumer society and no we're not recognizing that we are part of that larger aliveness and thirdly we're not recognizing The evolutionary Journey and and it's Dimensions that we've been speaking about we think well uh we die and the lights go out that must be pretty much it and no uh we're going on and on and on as Chris you've been speaking about the reincarnational universe uh we just need go on evolving through it all so really the transition that I see is first of all threefold uh a new recognition of where we are is a living system secondly a recognition of of who we are as beings we're part of that larger aliveness and thirdly where we're going is Way Beyond uh consumerism and such it's learning to live in that larger aliveness what an extraordinary Journey uh that we would be blessed with the gift of entering into that kind of Journey and you were bringing up the good the question Chris well how in the world do we make the transition the threefold transit uh and understanding the universe freshly who we are freshly and where we're going well um a lot of attention is being put right now on material systems uh well it's a climate crisis so that means too much CO2 in the air which means well we got to cut back on on the cars that we drive and so on it's a material response to a trans material challenge before us and so um again and again people will say well what are you going to do about it and what one of the key things I've been working on for decades is media and why media a media isn't that the problem we've got so much media it's consu is hypnotizing us into a materialistic mindset and all we have to show for it is more consumerism no this goes way beyond that because the mass media is the access to the mass mind here we are on on a call with people in different parts of the world right now and we're beginning to grow uh the the neurological structures of the species as we use the mass media that we have right here to speak with one another and to grow a new understanding a new consensus a new consciousness of who we are as a species so one of the critical elements I feel of a transforming future is to transform our uses of media and this Gathering now is an example and it there are so many more we're exploding into a new opportunity to use the media to reflect to use it to reflect on who are we and then to communicate back well I've seen that mirror and myself in that mirror and I see a new possibility out there and let's begin to evolve into that possibility so we're on the cusp we're on the brink we're on the threshold of using the the extraordinary media potentials that are out there right now two-thirds of the people on this planet have one of these things a cell phone two-thirds of the people on the planet all we have to do is pick up that cell phone and we have access to a majority of people on this planet by the end of this decade it'll be three quarters of the people on this planet have access to the to the uh Collective Mind through one of these so we are over and down right now with the with the tools the capacities to communicate with one another and to and to grow into a new Collective Consciousness uh of of those three dimensions of transformation that were just right on the threshold of pushing against and uh the rules pushing back against us and so it's a learning time for the species it's an Awakening time a learning time a growing time and we're way over endowed with all the tools we need to go through that Learning Journey yeah this is one area where our work is complementary to the other because you are a deeply committed lifelong committed social activists and you understand in ways that go beyond me far beyond my understanding of how this how social transformation can take place what are the roots that are holding us stuck where are the where are the opportunities for facilitating deep social change at a collective level at a practical tangible manifest level my work has been much more internally focused so let me speak to the inside of this process because while my psychedelic experience has been deeply Collective it takes place in one room you know in one house in on one street so it's it's a very different way to access the collective let me tell you the next installment or just point to the next installment into my own Journey personal death rebirth went through that Collective death rebirth went through that began to have these Visionary experiences of where the human species was being taken of this in extraordinary future no explanation of how we were going to get there carried me then passed that into a series of profound mystical experiences of non-duality and shunyata emptiness and you know sort of deep ecstatic Joy then it took me into the diamond Luminosity work which occupied the last five years of my work and in the middle of those of those Diamond new velocity sessions where I was expecting fully to be returned because I was coming back into the diamond Luminosity about once a year about every five sessions purified purified purify bam Diamond Luminosity purify purify purify boom more but I'm in luminosity and I was about I was expecting about time to get back into the diamond luminosity but that's not what happened in what was my 55th session in 1995 coming up on what almost what 24 23 years ago I went through a process where I dissolved completely into the species I just I became hard to imagine but hard to describe I became dissolved into the collective unconscious so deeply that my individual Consciousness was basically just a slow remnant and I entered into what I call Deep time I'd gone beyond linear time many times before this dissolved me very very deeply into deep time so I was it was a trans temporal experience so I had exploded the boundaries it was transpatial experience it was a trans temporal experience and it took me into the future deeper than I had been taken up to that time and suddenly I began to experience systematically methodically clear Isabel I began to experience the death and Rebirth of the Human family it was like being able to experience a thunderstorm where you can see the patterns you experience the patterns of the storm as a whole and you experience all of the individual drops in the storm simultaneously so it's a both an aggregate but also Collective and I experienced the entire Human family moving into a period of crisis the ordinary structures of our world were being broken down and Stripped Away we were losing control we were being shattered civilization was being shattered lives were being torn apart it was just extraordinarily painful the whole Human family was being shoved to the edge of apparent Extinction and is built and built for a long time in the session and then just when it looked like that was it this was it we were coming to the end of it all it was like a hurricane passing over an island and the worst of the storm passed and things began to get lighter they began to get lighter people began to pick themselves up we began to find each other after this and many many people had died but many survived and as we began to survive we realized we discovered that we had been changed this crisis tapped us into something so deep it drove us so deep into our being that it opened it unlocks something in us we shed things we we just literally we had stripped from us all sorts of assumptions and accumulations that tapped us into what I came over time to think of as the one heart that all of our individual hearts are aspects of the one heart when we began to find each other and meet each other there was a there was a creativity that was catalyzing new social forms new forms of cultural creativity and this created feedback loops where creativity fed new creativity and there was an exponential in growth in levels of awareness that were grounded in new values new perceptions of the good new understandings of human nature new understandings of nature itself new understandings of the Divine foreign this is what I think of what I came to see was this was a forecast not a forecast because I was in deep time which means I experienced this transformation from the perspective in which it was already happening and in the end I experienced it as something that had already happened and something that was yet to happen it was this not confusing but the kind of both and experience that sometimes opens in very deep psychedelic experience it took me about a year to recover from this one session what I the way I put in the book is when I walked around my town in Ohio and I saw all these beautiful beings all these Souls who did not consciously at an individual level know what they were coming into but I knew that at a soul level they knew what they were getting into at a soul level they had chosen to Incarnate at this time in history I just felt myself surrounded by courageous Souls who were entering consciously into this very very intense Century of transformation it was like walking around Hiroshima the week before the bomb dropped everyone around me I saw was entering into this terrible Catalyst of pain and yet they were deep and profound spiritual Warriors it took me a long time to learn how to live with that to hold that but I did and eventually I brought it into dark night early Dawn and then I brought it more fully into LSD in the mind of the universe and that's a perspective that I know I share with you Dwayne yeah it's interesting yeah yeah um as as a long time uh social activist and such I want to bring a another note into our conversation before we we conclude and that is um there are no guarantees here uh we've seen uh the possibilities we've seen the potential we've felt it in our souls and our bones and our being we know that's possible but there's no guarantee we're going to realize that as a species um as I look at the world I see three great possibilities for our pathway ahead one is what we've just been speaking about uh extraordinary invitation uh into greater aliveness and and possibility but there are two other possibilities that are very very real uh one is the future of a collapse and and really the functional extension of the species not their complete Extinction but the functional Extinction were no longer a force and evolution on the earth nor are we connected well enough with one another to make a difference in our Collective lives and build the kind of species body that you're speaking about Chris uh that we could end up just so fragmented and so diminished that we never have the opportunity to uh pull that species body together in its Learning Potentials that's the second possibility a third possibility very real uh we can see now is the authoritar Aryan future we can see that in in Russia we can see it in China we can see it beginning in India and other parts of the world we can see it in the United States for heaven's sakes the authoritarian uh orientation is so strong people are ready to surrender their freedoms and what you're speaking about and what I'm speaking about is claim your freedom claim your freedom to be a a living participant in a living Universe grow into that freedom don't surrender it to the uh to the scientists that look at only a material Universe don't surrender it to the media and the politicians that say no it's just about more and more material well-being for all people on the planet there are three great paths before us and the one that you've been speaking about and then that I have as well is is a narrow pathway I feel into the future and we're going to have to do everything we can as a community not just as individuals but as you say Chris as a community to elevate ourselves so awaken ourselves to grow into that uh future of evolutionary potential to learn to live in that larger aliveness so bless your brother and I thank you so much for your life of contribution and service and that and and that future yeah and you true brother me before as we transition soon into questions and answers which is going to take us into a whole other Journey right with us here I have the view and I think Dwayne shares this view that we have entered this century is a century of Labor we have been gestating the future human from millennia for tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of years we've been gestating it through reincarnation over and over deeper and deeper but now we've come into labor gestation is long labor is short gestation can be gentle and take place while we can keep other things going on on the surface labor is not like that is it labor is intense it requires complete Interruption of Life as we have ordinarily experienced it and we turn deeply within and we are in the process of giving birth to collectively well I'm calling the future human many people have seen this they've felt it they give it different names homo spiritualists homo noeticus all sorts of different names but the fundamental idea is that we are giving birth to a different kind of human being a different level a different a more evolved form of humanity foreign what might this future human look like what is the what is the substance of the future human and here I I go back to the theme of reincarnation I go back to some of the experiences that I describe in LSD in the mind of the universe and there was you know I've done past life therapy before when I wasn't doing the LSD work and I I know about I've been familiarized with about a dozen of my former lives nothing special no one special just ordinary run-of-the-mill peasants for the most part but I had a sense of that you know but what happened in this particular session is that all my former lives began to come back into me they all just started coming in very fast and furious I'd already gone through a tremendous purification process and the death rebirth process but then these lives started coming into me it was like wrapping uh filaments of light around a kite spool each rap was one life and at a certain point they hit critical mass and when they hit critical mass there was an explosion of energy and I've experienced this explosion of diamond light blow out my chest catapulting me into a completely new State of Consciousness and all those individual lies fused into one into a singularity and then a teaching kept on folding and explaining what was going on first the experiences then The Illuminating of the experience but the basic Vision that emerges is this it's a different vision of human of reincarnation than we find in many of the Eastern cultures the classical view of reincarnation is okay reincarnate reincarnate reincarnate get better and better more compassionate more intelligent more this more that growing level by level by level and when you achieve enlightenment when you achieve a realization that you can understand and let your mind sink into the essence of its source and you come to that shattering realization that the essence of your life is absolute is exactly the same as the essence of everybody else's life and the essence of life itself you know Atman is Brahman yes our nature is our Buddha nature when we reach that point classic thinking is okay now we can leave you've achieved Enlightenment you have achieved Moksha Escape you no longer have to be entrapped with an ego but you no longer have to be entrapped within time and space you have permission to leave your work is done but that's not what came forward in my sessions what came forward in my session was the birth of the diamond soul which meant that which was the phenomenon that we are reaching a point in human evolution where we have we have been working and integrating and and getting rid of all of our negative Karma purifying ourselves healing relationships healing the scars which had been torn into our heart healing the social scars healing the the civilizational scars we're working and working that material there Comes A Time when our entire history begins to coalesce in the early stages of that coalescing often takes a form of healing purifying dealing cleaning out the basement so on and so forth but there comes a point when that work is done and all of those lives congeal and there is an explosion of Consciousness where we no longer experience ourselves as a one generational time space 100 year old being we experience ourselves as a hundred thousand year old being we experience ourselves as Souls and not a human being with a soul we experience what a human being actually is we experience ourselves as souls and this is what I call the birth of the diamond soul because we often tend to use the word Soul as the spiritual non-embod the non-physical counterpart to our individual personality that's not the soul I'm talking about I'm talking about the Consciousness that holds all of our farmer lives all of them as one and now what I think is happening is usually we experience that diamond Soul only after we die you know we go small to big when we die ah yeah come back to small we grow some more then we die ah yes it feels so good to be big again but what's happening I think if we keep that up just keep it up long enough sooner or later the soul wakes up inside physical existence and when that happens heaven manifests on earth when that happens Nirvana is samsara when that happens we realize we don't have to go anywhere to experience absolute Bliss and sheer Joy the goal of evolution of spiritual evolution is not to spiritually mature and then leave I understand where that view came from I understand its historical context it makes perfect sense within the context of 5 000 years ago before we understood how old the universe was how big it was and how much intelligence had been sunk into building this universe the goal of our spiritual evolution is to awaken to truly awaken to our soul Consciousness which opens us into a different relationship with all other beings with whom we share this planet and opens us into a different relationship to the intelligence that is manifesting time and space continuously regenerating it the goal is to awaken to that to embody that in our physical being not a disembodied transcendental Awakening but an embodied Awakening and then to bring that Consciousness into the making of History into the making of the planet into the making of a civilization a world which truly does work for all you're here how far can we take this what will it look like it's not going to look like just what it looks like in the very beginning stages what our spiritual Traditions have told us over and over again is that mind creates our destiny as the Mind leads Destiny follows we are creating our reality with our mind when our mind is fragmented and conflicted we live in a fragmented and conflicted reality now this is we have to be careful this is not simply an individual story it's a collective story there's a dynamic feedback between our individual manifestation our Collective manifestation you know but basically we are learning I think how to control the nuclear energy which is the soul the fiery energy light energy which is our essential Divine energy cosmic energy we are learning how to be gods and I don't mean that in any superficial sense we are evolving into a being which truly not only will be at peace with ourselves and at Harmony with each other but a being which has capacity to manifest creativity inside time and space the likes of which maybe today we only know in the mystical literature and the spiritual literature what the Tibetans call the mahasidas the great beings the great beings around who have the capacity to work miracles they have the capacity to manifest Consciousness in ways that absolutely Dazzle our mind and don't make any sense within a materialist scientific perspective because they have gathered so much conscious power that they can Manifest this in a way that bends the laws of physics so to speak and not I suspect what they're doing is manifesting a deeper set of laws of physics that are manifest at a lower energy level this is high energy physics yeah so I think we're coming we're giving birth to the Future human we're giving we're maturing we're growing into a mature adult and if we ask well what does a mature adult look like it's not simply a human being the way we are now with higher values and better values it's truly an awakened human being a soul-centered human being that lives at peace with themselves and at peace with each other and now we pivot and of course this isn't the this isn't the end of the story right let's assume for the minute we make this transition one century two centuries three centuries we make this transition Universe isn't stopping right we're going to be here for millions billions of years right we have at least four billion years before the sun goes Supernova we got to be off the planet about two billion years that's a lot of time you're going this is just the beginning of a transition we're just waking up we're like children in the crib created by the universe waking up into this beautiful room we're just waking up to what we are who we are activating our potential and moving on moving forward that now I I believe with Dwayne that he's right no there's no guarantees here this is we have to put we have to everybody show up everybody has to maximize everything they can do to possibly to make this to get us through this to bring us through this whole transition I understand that and I accept that and I think that's true but I also would like to offer you a slightly different perspective from within my psychedelics experience and I don't know how to reconcile these two but from within my psychedelic experience I've been taken so deep into the future so many times and then my last deep Vision the 70th session was my last what I called it the great Visions deep into the future and from that deep future I experience this transformation as a given as something that we had accomplished not something that was an open-ended possibility but something which we had truly accomplished so from my own personal heart I cannot doubt that we will make this transition I worry deeply about what it's going to cost us how many of our children will die how many of our world's children will die of starvation and you we know what's coming in that way that's what I'm worried about and it's going to take every one of us at maximum exertion to really pull this off and yet we're not driving this right human beings are not driving this nature is driving this the creative intelligence of nature is driving this we didn't give ourselves the big brain a hundred thousand years ago we didn't give ourselves The evolutionary qualities that are embodied in ourselves and our mind and in our physical body some larger process is driving this process the most we can do is cooperate with it to recognize to wake up to see what's happening cooperate with it and to become a collaborator a co-creator of this future human which we will then in our future incarnations incarnate into but I think the shift that we're seeing taking place it's grinding its way forward is a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche it's a shift at the very very deep structure that after we make this shift every human being born will be operating out of a different Collective psyche out of a different level of Soul awareness and that's the work of the hour that's what we and we all knew we were getting into this when we were born we chose to be part of this process and with that knowledge we can relax even while we go to work we can relax in that deeper way of taking spiritual nurturance from the universe even as we go to work and do our best yeah so brother let's open it up and see what these good people uh where they want to go yeah thank you brother this has been a delight to share this this hour with you and um I'm so deeply grateful I just want to say for our friendship over these decades bless you yeah likewise brother yeah as as said from this place what an amazing deep words it's not about the words about the Energy felt during your dance um it's transformative by itself so I'm I'm really I'm really honored by these words and I have thousands questions that I said off your course Chris I gained thousand questions more and now I got 2 000 questions but concerning the time I want to open up your the microphone for um the fellow the the fellow wisdom keepers uh people have questions sharings uh whatever comes up wants to be shared now is the time and the place and our questions as hosts will come maybe at the end so um if you have a question if you have want something to share just open up your microphone and feel comfortable to uh to uh to go I see Todd has got his hand raised well it is lovely to see you both and I would offer that your conjoined Synergy is part of that love that um gives us great optimism for future I'm a painfully optimistic sort because of having tasted that unconditional love and that complexity that's about and so I my Optical unchanged though we do know there's a collective great nde coming for the species but the transformative power is wonderful just to offer some of the small kernels that I see changing is just the fact that we're talking about you know psychedelics are not a Panacea for every individual but they are so quickly entering a wider conversation and to me that's going to be one of the essential tools to help change the Consciousness individually and then of course collectively just as one tiny little nugget um I received email yesterday of a group and some of the folks I know that are deeply thoughtful and deeply committed toward a whole list understanding of existence and they're putting together leadership schools with a psychedelic component to those with a cohort goes through thinks deeply about all the things that you know a planetary holistic Universal idea but with the aid of having that transformative Discovery within and then going forth all together to a with a greater understanding and to me that's was unheard of just a few few years ago let alone a decade or two and so for those to me are those moments of showing that there are so many folks working toward a greater understanding that that will get here even though there's going to be great pain before that's manifested on a wider scale so anyway thank you for your work and I share your optimism and it's unshakable damn it and how could we not mention this great book by Dwayne choosing Earth and there's a film that he and Colleen have created there's a course which they have created there are no number initiatives and Grant I'll let you talk about this but this is an extraordinarily powerful book and one of the things I love about it he's given it away it's like too important to try to make any money off it he's been giving it away and if you get it in the PDF form all the references are hot linked so you can pop right right right into one article after another one Research Institute after another it's all hot linked and you can move right into it and go very deeply Dwayne uh the one thing I would say moderating my optimism this book looks uh oh 60 70 years into the future and I've been doing Futures research for a half century truly and uh this book is the accumulation of that half century of work and um I want to be optimistic but boy I'll tell you uh it's Fierce the world is coming down on us now not 10 years from now but no um and we could run through the elements once again but the reality is we're up against it now and it requires our courage now it requires our our Collective Consciousness now it requires a new media to reflect back to us new possibilities new priorities New Perspectives on on where we are who we are where we're going now so to the extent that there are people watching and this program now get on with your work get on with your life choose the freedom that you have off your creativity to our wounded world to move into this more transforming future so um thank you you bet yeah I see a hand of uh Henrik you can open up your mind please hey thank you um so I uh came here as someone who's curious and uh so I am going to ask a question at the risk of sounding flippant because I obviously don't have the experience that the three of you have um but I'm just going to ask this question from a position of curiosity and trying to get some clarity so I've heard a lot of things um reincarnation Karma you know the path of the soul is taking the path of humanity going forward uh we come from a source in intelligence uh and it sounds like it's a very profound world view right and I I came from a Christian worldview I am no longer in that world um and my question is what makes you guys so convinced this is actually a reality or this is actually true and it's not just the LSD messing with your heads to be I told you I was gonna be flipping but you guys absolutely good question Lauren absolutely thank you I'll take a shot Dwayne then you take a shot yeah okay Ken ring founder of near-death episode studies founder of the Journal of near-death studies uh good friend long friend he and I he yes in question of being acid Harden pushed it hard and uh we had a back and forth dialogue and it was so rich we decided we'd publish it so if you were to go to medium.com there's an article that you can track down by that it's a knit it's a dialogue between Ken and I and the title is our deep psychedelic experiences trustable how do we know that I'm just not picking up on The Echoes of my personal mind or I'm picking up Echoes of the collective psyche are there criteria that we can use to evaluate these experiences and I just lay it out as clearly as I can Ken punches at me I respond it's a good dialogue it's a really important question are they trustable right uh there's not a simple answer to that question you really have to kind of take it and look at it deeply as you go through it because it's not enough to say experientially they're trustable there has to be more meat on those bones it has to be more more substances and I think there is I think we do have some empirical evidence that these experiences are verifiable and are trustworthy some of them not all of them but then there are other ones which begin to look at cross-disciplinary coherence that adds another layer of trustability it's yeah it's an important question what I would emphasize is that I would never say the things that I said today if I were speaking 30 years ago now because if you take a look at my scholarship and I know Dwayne scholarship it's not just that we're sharing ex Visionary experiences we've done our homework I don't offer reincarnation as a philosophical or theoretical perspective or based on an experiential perspective I did my homework I looked at all the available evidence for reincarnation I looked deeply at Stan gross work and the available evidence and support of the of the hypotheses and the cosmology that he's presented in many of his books so it's a combination of rigorous scholarship which has lots of different aspects to it and then carefully recorded uh offered psychedelic experiences and what we find of course is there's a the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work is essentially the same as the cosmology that emerges in other deep contemplative mystical Traditions it's not a new cosmology it's simply a new way of accessing that same fundamental Court worldview yeah Dwayne yep let's see that's a really important question uh really important and um I raised you know the book The Living Universe I spent 30 years looking across cultures uh through different dimensions of Science and so on to ask that question is there any agreement as we look around the world through different wisdom Traditions that this is the nature of reality or am I just fantasizing that we're living in this living entity well indeed there's a very strong consensus and um a surprisingly strong consensus um and if we had more time I would love to get into that so first of all um if we look at the world's wisdom Traditions there is a growing consensus about the nature of reality human identity and The evolutionary Journey secondly if you want other evidence um as I said I spent three years in in a laboratory setting with experiment after experiment exploring the intuitive potentials of the human being and that's those are the potentials that are required for us to reach into the larger universe and draw into ourselves the insights that Christians so beautifully spoken of and I assure you that the CIA would not continue the intelligence agency would not continue this work for 20 years after uh they declared it secret they went for another 20 years unless they were getting meaningful validated scientific information about our expanded capacities as human beings so we can go to different sources of of validation and verification but it's there but we're just beginning to accumulate that evidence uh no and that is now being presented to to us and and whether through the Psychedelic vehicle or through the meditation experiences and so on uh but it the the evidence is there and um uh beautiful question though thank you yeah and in addition to that article by Ken and I that dialogue uh you'll see a reference there and you can find it at my website chrisbase.com and you can also see it in academia.edu where I've I've put a lot of my major articles posted you just look up Chris Bish there and there's a section from the first chapter of dark night early Dawn which really drills down on this question and the section is called the epistemic value of psychedelic experience right the epistemological value and I really lean on that and hard so yeah important question yeah I appreciate your your answers thank you very much and uh for Sue please open up your microphone okay I just want to say a huge thank you to both Chris and Dwayne because I think they have the most enormous courage and I feel encouraged to face whatever it is that may be coming our way because they have the courage to go there and detail both Chris through I've read your book so I I know the detail of how much pain you know Collective human or other human human pain that you went through and I just think yeah to have kept going with that we've kept going is absolutely amazing so thank you and for Dwayne to look into the future to see really the terrifying prospects there and still to you know be encouraging us and going forward so I just wanted to say I wonder whether there are collective Consciousness has gone down rather than up which with reincarnation the idea is that you learn something you come back but I personally I feel that the goddess culture is going back to pre-history had a lot of very high Consciousness going on you know minoan civilizations Etc and I kind of feel that through our materialism our Consciousness has has kind of gone down become more limited so I suppose I wonder whether the idea of reincarnation taking us forward how that could fit to a a kind of decline in in Consciousness and and awareness of who we are in a living Universe because I think there were cultures in previous times that had that sorry I'm going a bit crazy on this thing on my screen stop but um so just I'll be interested in what you thought about that brain you want to start on this one and I have a very simple uh response to that uh we have just become a collective species civilization only in the last few decades uh with with the growth of the mass media uh in the post post World War II era we are becoming a collective entity a collective being if you will that's not to diminish the the wakefulness of earlier uh people and civilizations but it's rather to recognize this is a new Epoch a new era a new condition of the whole Human family being pushed together by multiple crises the you know we went down the list the climate crisis the species exhibition all the rest we are being compressed and squeezed as a species to awaken in a new way though and we did not have those pressures in earlier times at a planetary scale and that's where we are now so this is a very unique situation it's not to diminish the past but it's rather to awaken to the challenges of the future I'd suggest a very simple analogy it you can look at it in the context of meditation but also in the concept of physiology if you fast for health if you go through an extended fast a safe fast and you're doing so for health what we find is that after a day or two you begin to have all sorts of flu-like symptoms you know you just feel miserable you feel terrible your nose is running and all this stuff and then after several days you move through that and then you enter a period where you begin to feel better than you had when you started same thing happens in meditation you meditate in order to feel better so you quiet your mind you get very still you fast your mind and what happens your unconscious begins to throw up all its garbage I mean it's just all the pain start coming up and all the emotions start coming up and you think what the hell why this is getting worse not better but if you hold it it event actually works its way through and you begin to move into a deeper State a sense of well-being understanding that reincarnation is happening not just individually but it's happening collectively one of the ways of understanding some of the rhythm of the epics that we've moving into or have been moving into is that Humanity has begun to detoxify itself literally I think souls are taking into their incarnations into their current incarnations and it has been for some time more karma than they might have in earlier Generations in earlier centuries they are literally stacking up more Collective and individual Karma to work on in their lifetime and if you looked at this only from the outside you would think that these we are kind of devolving because we're dealing with more and more basic problems and more Elemental problems but again from an evolutionary perspective If We Hold this if we hold a perspective like on meditation like on fasting we are clearing this past humanity is clearing its path and it looks maybe like things are getting worse but I think what it is is we're getting down to business we're getting onto some serious business and we are healing that past but the only way to heal that past is to confront it is to let it into your awareness we heal the past by expanding our Consciousness and embracing the consciousness of it and likewise socially manifesting states of states of awareness in our culture where we heal the racism we heal the genderism we heal the speciesism by holding that in our awareness and saying no we're not going to do that anymore we're not going to rape our daughters anymore we're not going to behave towards people of other cultures and other colors the way we've done in the past we're going to move into this into a better world so it is a complex picture but I think from a deep enough perspective it can begin to make more sense you okay I would like to add something as a holistic doctor as well because from a biological perspective um as you see our brain developments during Evolution I think trauma has a major effect especially the collective trauma which made us during Evolution less receptive for the collective view instead of um yeah seeing live is separate and we're now waking up of these um Collective trauma and the healing as you said so I think there are several aspects which are very coming together on a biological but also in the social but on spiritual level which comes together which give us deeper insights at these evolutionary swings during our last decade so thank you um but David uh saw a hand of you please open up your microphone David you're not Audible New York yeah I'm okay now yeah I want to thank you both so so much that we're so moving and I want us to be moved tonight I mean out of this I want us to be taking some action I'm 80 now I know I'm in the Final Phase of my life it might go on 20 years or whatever whichever way you look at the mathematics I'm in the Final Phase of my life I don't have children so I haven't passed on genes but I've been thinking recently it isn't only jeans at this moment the important thing is passing on memes I'm going back to Richard Dawkins original formulation of that he was looking for um a sociological a social thing that was transferred and it's the memes that we now pass on to Future Generations that are important and what are those memes for me is unconditional love I can't go through the story of how that's come up in my my my life I did my as a very mature student I did my masters in Consciousness and transpersonal psychology on the title of from Fear of the other to unconditional love I really looked into the nature of it but how do we move how how do we move from here we've got a prevailing ecosystem of memes which are separation which and with separation comes um you you have to make up for this emptiness somehow as you say we are we are the one at our deepest levels so separation leads us to Greed and all all the things that are happening and so that's a prevailing ecosystem how do we change it and sometimes if you have a prevailing ecosystem which dominates there can be niches in that Eco system where new cells conform and I see as a and like this is a cell here tonight and I'm a Consciousness only person I think the nature of reality is consciousness and I think we underplay the value of this a zoom meeting for example we think we're all in separate places we are but Consciousness itself is non-local there's no separation between our minds at this moment if we were in the same room your words Chris and do it um doing that they would be sounding the same in our heads whatever the medium of transmission so right now we're not separate here we're not separate now we we can communicate mind to mind and sometimes um species um have different phases of their their of their individual Evolution right like a fungus can have a place as a Spore and then it can come to Earth and then form and I think there's a great possibility in doing you were talking about this the of the the medium right like this that we can form these cells of spores at the moment so we're ready to come to Earth and we can begin to come to earth now and I hope out of this meeting tonight there will be a few people I want to be part of cells now looking at how we can transform I I haven't had a psychedelic path I took I took acid once 50 years ago um a new girlfriend introduced me to it and it blew my it blew my mind if I could have continued if I could have got standardized Doses and proper supervision I definitely would have continued but I probably wasn't um ready for it at that time but I I know that the power Captain one that one experience it it you know it changed a lot of things for me so what I would like to do is uh maybe the convenience of this meeting could I'll put my email address and if anybody wants to form a cell to write to take up some of the themes we've been talking about I would love to be part of that so and I want it I want us to move from tonight so thank you both very much of such a stimulating and motivating tool uh thank you David and how do we change how do we move forward and when I when I'm asked that question in public lectures I say read Dwayne elgin's book talk to Dwayne Elgin so Dwayne this one's yours thank you both uh David uh first thing I would say is that uh separation is is uh is now breaking down and um like it or not we're being pushed into a sense of uh Unity as a species organism and we need to step up to take care of uh the emergencies that surround us now so first of all the separation is true and it has been really Amplified by a consumerist materialist mindset but that mindset is breaking down it that is the mindset that's creating the the crises that we're facing right now so um the first thing that needs to happen is we withdraw legitimacy from that mindset that world view that Paradigm and we are we are withdrawing legitimacy from that paradigm if you look at the young people on the planet surveys show a reason Global survey showed that 57 percent of young people feel we are doomed quote we're doomed that's what they were saying 57 now the politicians are certainly not saying that the uh the corporate uh people are not saying that typical uh academics are not saying that religious leaders traditionally are not saying that but it is servicing in the world nonetheless because that is the reality is breaking you know separations breaking down those legitimacy of the old institutions is is declining and so we have an opportunity to choose new Pathways ahead personally institutionally collectively and so this is a an extraordinary time in human history when when we do have it we have freedom there's this interval of Freedom that we have to make choices Anew and we didn't have that like when I'm 80 as well David and uh so when I was young boy there were not there wasn't the freedom to make those kind of choices but there is now and so uh this is an Awakening time uh for the Human family instead of time to use the media and and the computer systems and all the rest create new memes create new memes uh for a possibility that's what Chris is doing that's what I'm doing and it's clearly it seems what you're doing as well keep going uh we're just getting started here keep going let me add a footnote to that when I was doing my psychedelic work I never let my students know about it never talked about it I mean I taught psychedelic research I taught Stan Groff's work but I never let them know that I was doing this work personally I only a few people and a few friends in my department knew what I was doing so I had these two separate sides of my life I had a silo where I did my psychedelic work and then I'd come to campus and I would be doing my ordinary teaching work but what I found was that the deeper I went in my psychedelic work the more the effects of that work began to spill over and show up in my classroom that my students were being impacted by my psychedelic Journey even though they weren't being impacted they weren't knowing about it they were I wasn't talking about it it wasn't a physical impact there was a thought of a psychic impact uh I began to find that there was a porosity where I was beginning to have access to aspects of their life where in my personal experience I was just answering a question I was reaching into the fertile void of my imagination to answer a question that a student was being asked but then I they would come up and tell me that the answer that I had given was an actual reflecting actually what was happening in their life that week this time and this was this was rattled me so badly that I began to have to study what the hell's going on here how can my personal work be producing these Collective manifestations and I I worked on this for a long time and eventually I wrote the book The Living classroom which is really not so much about teaching it's about the Dynamics of the collective psyche in groups States Of Consciousness there is no such thing as private realization States Of Consciousness are inherently Collective an awakened State of Consciousness naturally distributes out around us it's like throwing a rock in a lake the ripples just spread out when a person begins to throw off the layers of distortion and pain and begin to enter into deeper and deeper states of clarity the people around us are naturally spontaneously and inevitably are affected now there are things that we can do to accelerate and intensify this contagion we can meet online we can we can dissolve distances of thousands of miles by bringing our minds together in this one space and I believe psychically we energize the the field of the smile of this Collective space if we did this once a week every week for several years we would begin to experience an even stronger field because it would be influenced by Rupert sheldrick's work and morphogenetic field Theory not just by the energy of this particular group of people but by all the people who had ever come together to study or to discuss this particular issue that's what I found in my classes too that it wasn't just a matter of my mind can sort of having a a derivative or an impact on the present students but the students and coming together to study these things and to learn these things we're generating a field and this field persisted after the students left and it was reinforced and deepened by the field by the students who came next semester so that there was a learning that was taking place within the semester and there was a learning that was taking place across semesters over years and years so we have the psychic reality that where one of us goes all of us go to a degree but then we can reinforce that by using the technology that reinforces this Collective sharing right and it doesn't have to be simply a psychic distribution it can be a physical distribution and a physical creativity yeah yeah great question David yep thank you thank you I see three three questions also a question in the chat box will uh we'll uh serve for the the the end uh and I want to say this because uh David I want to reassure you this movement will continue and we as a wizard Keepers we already started this this trajectory of this movement so everyone is subscribed uh for this wisdom Keepers or the former wisdom Keepers will be invited for our next wisdom Keepers Circle to keep this alive and doesn't matter where you want to share your um yeah your your future perspectives or your ideas Etc you were more than invited in our next Gathering our Circle will be on the 18th of February that's on a Saturday to have space for everyone to wants to be involved uh to continue with the journey and to learn to grow into maturity so uh great question David thank you um are they regular um meetings how far apart are they so we we want monthly because uh as youngsters we and youngsters I feel I'm almost 50 a male a little bit younger but you are youngsters I I I do my psychedelic training I I do my psychedelic work I'm a doctor I have a retreat center and Etc so monthly basis but there are a lot of groups where you can share in but uh you're more than invited to uh to join and to um to join together yeah I'll come I'll I'll also put my email address in the in in the chat box okay thank you very much I'll let the questions move on yeah perfect and I think it's and that's a that's an indirect question uh or a Council of Elders as we already discussed Chris uh during the the LSD in the mind of the universe course I think it's wise to invite them as well just to open a space for wisdom Keepers to uh to add their wisdoms during the meeting so we can learn and Thrive to get so thank you for that um a question by Todd please fill up okay I'll be briefs and I already had my turn but uh I want to mention to Dwayne um first of all thank you both again for everybody that shows up here for for being part of this living classroom but Dwayne I had captive here and I might have shared with you previously um my son is a college student and several of his friends uh for a recent uh for spring break and we used your book choosing Earth and we had little assignments and play and deep conversation but I what I would offer is that if we're not amongst those of that age group we're not realizing to what degree the Consciousness is already changing amongst those Greeks those folks I mean it's it's palpable different and the questions that they're asking are starting from a higher or deeper level of Consciousness you know I'm not to in any way malign you two lovely 80 year olds but I'm a great fan of the Actuarial tables I mean I think that's our our continuing reincarnation uh blender and so when you see these ones coming up that are having the questions that they're grappling with have already been answered in their mind that previous generations thought were not even questions were valid so anyway I appreciate choosing Earth and there are a lot of good youth out there that are populating further and farther and forward so thank you and good night thank you thank you Tom aren't they aren't they just amazing they are so much farther along the young people are than we were when we were their age I mean it's just it's like when when the going gets tough God sends in The A-Team you know they are just extraordinary in their capacities in their Drive Terry you've got your hand up I do and uh thank the wisdom Keepers yet so thank you for for putting this on and thank you Chris I've been following you a bit over the years and Dwayne um I had never heard of you until I read um choosing Earth so huge gratitude for giving that to us for free really really appreciate that and my question has to do with um the labor pains and the creative intelligence is it is it in the realm of possibility that things like like covet like the climate climate crisis that they're part of the labor pains to bring us into an Awakening an awareness a connection a worldwide Union of of spiritual Souls um to to know to know the truth and to move us forward into a miraculous future yes yes absolutely yes indeed uh the trauma of the traumas of our time are catalysts for awakening and so a trauma is not something to avoid but rather to embrace to learn from and to rise above and so we are being pushed by the traumas of our own creation the uh Speech and Extinction resource depletion uh climate uh crisis and so on these are these are things we're creating but now we're the our Creations are coming back to uh impact us and and to push us into a larger sense of who we are as a species a deeper sense of of what is going on here and where we're going so absolutely this is a part of the labor pains of the birth of a species civilization and soul yes okay thank you yep I really do uh yeah you got it yeah you know what we're seeing going into this Century where we are now decade by decade things are going to be getting worse it's going to be a deeper unraveling uh a deeper falling apart we can see some of the ways in which this is likely to manifest it's going to manifest in ways that we can't anticipate quite yet and it's going to hurt like hell but as Dwayne said these are all these are problems of our own making these are problems of our own making so we're going to have to confront that in us which has made these problems and I again I want to remind you who is confronting this crisis who's going to be going into this Global Systems crisis not human beings the way we ordinarily think of human beings Souls will be going into this crisis each human being carries multiple multiple multiple incarnations woven into the fabric of their psycheon into their body that means that each human being is carrying potentially thousands of years of experience going into this crisis some of those experiences are really negative and kind of you know destructive but many of those experiences are are mature wiser and we if we if the world is at odds with itself our soul is also at odds with itself we're having to come to terms with our own limitations and the important Point here is that what's happening on the world out at large mirrors what's happening in the world intra-psychically the world is trying to become one is trying to confront the limitations of his past behaviors but we carry those that those behaviors we carry those Tendencies inside our psyches so that as the world is struggling to become one we are struggling to become coherent within ourselves and become one soul and I think there is a Synergy there so that the the the drivers of Global Systems crisis in global climate change and and the various uh diseases that will be hitting us and so on and so forth those are driving a global Awakening and simultaneously they're driving an inner internal Awakening so it's a full-time situation all right thank you thank you both thank you Terry it's amazing how two and a half hours um already passed and it feels like we're just beginning and that's it's a beautiful thing and I want to create 10 more minutes for a rounding part as we say psychedelics it needs to be beautifully around before we go I want to invite someone didn't ask a question but feel somewhere deep inside itself want to ask a question to think about it to have this opportunity to ask or to share someone something I want also to give the opportunity to my uh to ask a question from whatever sword it is and I go to the chat box now because I saw there was a question came coming in and I have to see where it is um sorry [Music] um so I can't find the question now I have a question okay so please so I can't find the question in the in the in the chat box now if you have put the question in the chat box please feel open to uh to raise your hand and ask us question uh Lively Mayo please go ahead and then Michelle Sawyer me okay Dwayne Chris I love you guys there's nothing more to say but I love you guys as much as I love everyone else as David said we are Consciousness and even even though we are utilizing some of the systems some of the actual technologies that perhaps might have brought us here in this time in our world faster than in The evolutionary history we are connected and this is what matters the most for me and hopefully for everyone else my question for both Chris and Dwayne Chris you mentioned compassion as well as Wayne you mentioned suffering and in in the other face of suffering there's compassion and with that there is beyond personal compassion and Beyond Collective compassion but what are the three practical steps that we can take today to gain the sense of compassion for Chris and Dwayne what are three practical or at least give us one practical application in a sense I'm looking forward to what does communication how does that play a role in this sharing in this understanding of compassion from our humanness not from the individuality but from the humanness that ties us all into the soul enrich life yeah good question hondoin uh she's asking us to put it on the line here yeah you know give us three specific things you want to take the first one all right golly I'm going to give one that I think uh he would be surprised with so what the heck uh I was going to be a doctor early on in life as I mentioned at the outset and I was thinking about being a vet or a doctor and so one thing that I do when I look at the world and how we humans are creating it I look at animal rescue videos and I tell you if you look at at the uh creatures of the earth and different parts of the earth and you go online and say well dog rescues or animal rescue and the videos start coming up and it just breaks the heart open and and the the love for the well-being of all life not just human life all life is just floods into your heart your soul your mind your Consciousness if you look at the suffering of animals and um and say well it could be better it doesn't have to be like that of why do they have to suffer so much well it it pushes back against us so number one uh I would say go online and just look at videos of animals and uh dogs and cats and so on and and how they're suffering um and this is goes beyond whether we eat meat or not this has to do with life and how it's being lived by the rest of the creature on this Earth uh that we share it with so that would be one it's really really powerful yeah I agreed when the thing that came into my mind first was take some suffering out of the world look at our lives take some suffering out of the world not only just between human beings leading towards a gentler life at a clearer life but towards other species look at how our life is impacting and causing suffering in the world and take it out in in spiritual practice and in Buddhist practice for example the first thing you do when you begin any meditation any practices you cultivate bodhichitta which is the cultivating the desire to save all sentient beings which is you're doing this practice not for yourself the last thing you do at the end of the practice is you do what's called the distribution of Merit you take all the Merit that you're generated with the practice and you give it away you give it away to all levels of the being because this is an attempt to shatter the illusion of individual Enlightenment we do not do these practices for ourselves it's not about personal transformation it's about Collective transformation and in terms of taking suffering out of the world Dwayne how could you not mention here were voluntary Simplicity the first book you wrote right yeah this is this is common sense for a world that's living over its means voluntary Simplicity simpler simple not in order to starve yourself or deny yourself but simpler in order to liberate yourself in order to and to liberate yourself to give yourself options that you don't have if you're committed to complexity affluence and so on and so forth so gentler shared and simpler yeah great thank you so much and and with with that um something that both of you created a an important note on is using media as tool yes how can we utilize the media David also spoke about circles besides watching videos of animals and also the suffering that we have as a world what are some ways that media can impact what what can we build how can we build these these these real connections with other human beings through these vegans are there any projects that both of you are involved that maybe we can jump on or or expand on that brain well great question um the choosing Earth Project choosingearth.org um really is is attempting to do this build networks of of care and compassion for the well-being of all life that's explicit in in the work that we're doing it's not just for we humans it's for all life we all rise or fall together and so um let's build the relationships of awareness of compassion of Love uh on behalf of the well-being of all life and uh it's just exploding uh onto the Earth right now and they're just countless uh avenues for um tapping into the creativity the Consciousness and the care The Compassion it's there and and and we need to meet what the opportunity that's now available uh and I'm thinking of young people as well at the same time and how far along this path they are relative to uh we adults we holders and by the way I don't think Chris is nowhere near 80 he's a kid on the Block yeah oh I'm only 73. 73 he's got a long ways to go so you know in the broader to sort of push beyond the sort of specific media question um I don't think to bring this revolution about to bring this transformation about it's going to take just all of the skills that we have all the capacity is here it's going to take doctors going to take social activists going to take Educators it's going to take politicians it's going to take artists it's going to take musicians it's if we start making an itemized list of what we need to do then we're inevitably shrink to some kind something that reflects our own personal strengths our own our personal agenda I think the the issue is not figuring out what we can do I don't think that's the hard part the hard part is finding the courage within ourselves to do with what we know we can do right here right now we are already standing on the spot where we have chosen to stand as our awareness as we come into awareness do we have the courage to do what we know we can do without delay right now right on and every one of us who asks who is willing to do that we're going to do different things because we have different aptitudes different agendas different karmic trajectories we don't need to do what somebody else is doing we just need to do what we have the capacity to do right here right now as deeply as we can and in that lives I think a deep existential satisfaction in that we can come to the end of our life and know we did our part and that's what we want isn't it we want to know that we did our part as deeply as we could yeah right great question thank you so much both of you for existing and for showering us with your wisdom and all of your energy we really appreciate who you are and what you are for all of us thank you you're very welcome thank you um Michelle Michelle everby uh you had a question thank you Bass um just listening to the last few answers has just brought up more questions so I'll hold those um my original question really projects far far into the future and arises from some of my own visions that I've had through meditation and at this point in our this historical Point as we are um at the ends of our experiment of separation and materialism within that context were held within this very dense physical body so Chris in your Journeys have you journeyed to the point or seen that place where there's no longer a need for this physical dense form where we actually are Consciousness in our etheric emotional causal bodies we don't need a physical body anymore but we are living this experience in this altered reality I suppose it wouldn't be this dense physical reality you know I don't question but that that is a potential that can be actualized and may be actualized over the long course of our evolutionary trajectory but my focus has been different and I think that I think that we have we're coming out of a period of history about 5 000 years old where we have had a kind of a transcendent orientation all the religions of the axial age of about the last three to five thousand years I think what happened was we began to have experiential access to the mother Universe we began to be able to go deep enough with our meditation yoga we'd be our psychedelics began to tap into the mother universe and when we did that we expected Joy Bliss ecstasy clearly this is home this is where we belong this is where we want to be and that leads leads to a story of the Fall and then salvation to get home the whole project is to get home to go back home and that the ramifications of that are to Value Transcendence over imminence so devalue Spirit over the physical body I understand that and that that we have Echoes of that but I think now in the 20th century 21st century now that science has pulled back the curtain and shown us how old the universe is and how big it is we measure it in light years six million million miles in one light year and we measure it in billions and billions of light years so big so old and so filled with genius that it doesn't really have the same appeal to say the goal is to leave it behind and so the my work went and it's not my work none of my sessions are my work I just opened up and let the universe talk to me and what it talks to me about is embodying spirituality transforming the body bringing it in deeper and deeper and deeper into the body that literally it changes our biochemistry it changes it allows us not only to be healthier but allows us to live longer SRI our bindo thought it would take his calculation was it would take 300 years of continuous spiritual practice before we could begin to become biologically self-regenerating and we could basically live forever in a human body it doesn't need to break down but we have to increase the energy within it but first we have to extend the life expectancy to give us the 300 years to allow us to do that type of practice his vision also is towards doing more and more and more spiritual stuff inside the beauty of the physical Universe to become co-creators with the physical universe now whether there are some aspects of this whole thing which are purely transcendental sure why not you know how many physical universes are there we don't know we have reasons we know you know we know we don't know so we don't know how big the entire arena is that we can incarnate into yeah I I I'd like to reply to that as well a wonderful question very interesting question um first of all I I I would point out that our universe even though it's 13.8 billion years old in Cosmic time that's a just an instant a cosmic instant and um my guess is that in addition to in not just my guess is that in addition to our universe we are embedded within the life force of a of a mother universe so we're a daughter Universe embedded in the spaciousness of a mother Universe the mother universe is completely unbounded in terms of dimensional constraints here we are living in the second third fourth dimension and that means we're just a couple of steps above a black hole we're just getting started here three dimensions four dimensions that's nothing in in the scale and the depth of the mother universe and so um a body is very useful if you're going to be confined to two three four dimensions get a body for that but if you're living in the in the context of the mother universe and the um the aliveness that goes vastly dimensionally beyond two three four dimensions into 200 300 400 Dimensions who knows what kind of vehicle is most appropriate most fitting for that Journey so but here we are though we're just getting started we're early in the in the evolutionary game I think um and so let's embrace the physicality that we have knowing that deeper and further in The evolutionary journey is the Transcendent possibility of hyperdimensionality and new forms of being and learning and and loving and living so yeah great if you put your hand up yes thank you both my dears um friends I would like to just build upon and add another thought to the question that was posed about I think what can we do now whatever um the masculine three things an a numerical position here uh and Chris I loved what you said about each individual because we're all you know unique expressions of the great uh whole will do something unique and different all necessary and all absolutely equal in importance absolutely and so to that I want to say that while we're thinking of media and ways of doing hyper connectivity and Broad scale connectivity to to understand that we are ourselves right between our ears is the greatest motherboard of all and any thought we have thought I'm not even talking about words now but any thought we have when we talk about morphogenetic fields is broadcast to these reaches of the universe to which you were just referring Dwayne there's no ends point on this stuff so if you want to start contributing as broadly and as powerfully as you can at this from this second on become a great student of your own thoughts and learn to notice them and check in is this really what I want to be contributing both to this being that's housed in this body in terms of my physical mental spiritual emotional health but also is this what I want to project out to uplift all of humanity and Beyond and if if it is great keep doing more of it if it's not course correct do a tweak here or there Elevate just a tad and know that in that moment you're doing a great and massive and infinite contribution and to just add another thought all of our encounters however um random or or unimportant in quotes they may seem to be and again we all go to the grocery store and we say thank you to the clerk if we're not scanning our own groceries um it's for a b hold that eye contact so that you know you've touched soul to soul and trust that that reverberates out infinitely because that person we were both nourished by that interaction both of us connected we found you know it's it's what Ubuntu you know it's I see you and you see me therefore we exist so yes yes uh the big loud and Broad things we can do but never underestimate that we can do all of that in an instant from where we are with what is in us right now yes amen thank you Eve thanks again for the beautiful contribution Eve thank you so much and it adds so much up to um to our first wisdom keeper we had in our wisdom Keepers Gathering uh Jude curvin oh yes speaking about the whole uh the Hologram and the informational field where we can add all our information what we transmit directly to this information field and and looking at the clerk and really sensing the souls it's amazing information adding up to uh to the mind of the universe so thank you for that and if you want to see uh the the former wisdom Keepers gatherings in the chat box you find the most upper Parts the the YouTube channel so if you want to look look it back feel free to do so um I feel we don't want to go home we're already home but we don't want to leave this setting and that's a beautiful a set of setting uh we created all together I invite one more question and then I have to be strict as a moderator uh so if one feels very urgently you want to ask a question or to share something feel free to open up your microphone it's on a random occasion let me try something may I make a little different suggestion boss I'd like to and I I'd like to just take this opportunity to the end to thank the group because I know that Dwayne and I have been carrying the weight of some of the discussion but boy what an extraordinary group this is all each one of you have come into this moment in time with a long history Long series of development and the the minds and the bodies and the awareness which you brought to this conversation made it the conversation that it became I have expressed such deep appreciation not only to Bass and the Mayo but to all of you for coming together for holding these questions for for holding this driving force which is taking us all forward thank you thank you so very much yes yes thank you Chris I would drive everybody to put a heart up on the screen and share a better love it there I don't know how to do that under reactions under reactions okay or use your hands okay sending love from this space to all and it's all felt as a community uh dear family um thank you for your contribution the donation as a gift as you all contributed as a as a community uh beautiful energies coming to the choosing Earth Project so send it tomorrow and um let's go on together as a family and we see each other a lot so thank you for joining a lot from this space thank you Chris Dwayne that's right for your work for your wisdoms thank you so much thank

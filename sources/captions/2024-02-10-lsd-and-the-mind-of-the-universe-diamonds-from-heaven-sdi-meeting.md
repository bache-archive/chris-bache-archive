welcome to San Diego integral February 10th 2024 our topic today LSD and the mind of the universe diamonds from Heaven presented by Chris bash welcome to San Diego integral um I'm Tom khabib and I'm a member of the leadership team we have an exciting presentation today l y in the mind of the universe we'll begin shortly but I first wanted to mention that we're recording this meeting if you prefer not to be seen on video you can turn your camera off although we love to see your reactions uh the link to the recording will be posted on Meetup a day or two after this event on sdi's uh YouTube channel also you can find future events on our website either Sand Diego enworld.org the Facebook page or coming back to meetup.com um the advantage of joining one of these groups is that you'll automatically be notified for future presentations if you have any questions today um about these meetings you're are welcome to contact one member of the leadership team any member next month we're meeting March 9th and the speaker is to be determined but it's going to be similar to today Chris was nice enough to do a pre-presentation of what he's going to talk about at the future human conference in May and San inro gets exclusive rights to this finally we invite you to make a small donation today to help cover the cost of our meetings and equipment and you can make that donation at SLE in.org I want to introduce Chris so as you've heard he's going to be a keynote presenter the upcoming icon conference the future human uh Chris is a professor ameritus in the department of philosophy and religion religious studies at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years he's also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of interr studies and at The noetic Sciences Institute and also on the advisory Council of stanlos gr's Legacy training one might ask how does a boy raised in the Deep South that is Vicksburg Mississippi uh who was raised Roman Catholic and actually entered the Seminary to become a priest write a book about his 20year journey with LSD it appears that Chris's Devotion to transformation appeared relatively early just as he was receiving his degree from Notre Dame's theology department and he was awarded ex award for excellence he decided to leave Catholicism this radical transformation occurred again at Brown University halfway through his doctoral program he realized that he had gotten what he wanted from biblical studies and his uh and in his words I changed horses and began again those of us in integral studies recognize this Fidelity to what wants to emerge although we may not always have the courage for radical Transformations Chris has now fashioned himself into a philosopher of religion he settled into Youngstown University where he would teach for the next 33 years along the way another transformation was pending Chris red stanoff gr work on work on the use of psychedelics and Psychotherapy the nonat non-dogmatic influences of Buddhism and Houston Smith perennialism we know and integral soon followed Chris ended his psychedelic Explorations in 1999 and it was until 2009 he wrote his first book The Living classroom here he shared how his expansive Consciousness seemed to impact his students in what he called leaky boundaries again those of us in integral recognize the psychoactive effect presencing has upon others in 20199 he wrote LSD in the mind of the universe diamonds from heaven some of which he'll share today and at the conference please give Chris bash a warm sandal integral welcome thank you everyone it's a pleasure to be here with you tonight uh since I my understanding is that psychedelics is not a frequent topic uh in the integral community in the San Diego integral community so in talking uh with Kathy and Tom and people on your board and we decided that we'd begin with a short breakout before I talk before I say anything just to do a quick inventory together of what each each of your backgrounds is with psychedelics both in terms of whether you have any psychedelic experience and if you have what have you had it with what context real short and the second part is what kind of beliefs have you formed about psychedelics either from your own experience or from your reading or conversations with other people so both what is your the nature of your experience and what are your beliefs and perceptions about psychedelics so we'll do it before and then after our talk we'll do an after okay so just about 10 minutes and Kathy will break you up into two uh groups Kathy breakout sessions are not recorded okay is everybody back yeah I think we're back roll back okay I sure wish I didn't want to encroach on your freedom I didn't want to be part of the groups I wanted you to have complete freedom to be able to say what was on your mind but I sure wish I could have been on the in the wall and heard your answers to the questions maybe when we get a little farther down the uh the line this evening in dialogue um you know I can learn what some of your answers were to the questions so all right so we've kind of looked at our history in terms of our own experience with psychedelics and what our own beliefs positive negative or neutral around psychedelics and now I'm just going to jump in and uh take you on a ride uh and take you give you an overview of my work uh that I've reported in my book LSD in the mind of the universe so let me share a screen here first of all let me ask first how many people have read my book just perfectly okay if you haven't how many people have just wondering okay good all right good to know um all right let me see if I can share my screen okay and uh just confirming we can see your screen you can see good am I seeing whoop supposed to go back all right okay somehow I wish I could get the whole screen to show okay \[Music\] so I'm a unusual person and that I've been a university Professor all my life teach a professor of religious studies teaching in a small College State College in Northeast Ohio and I've also uh done one of the longest regimens of highdose LSD work that I'm aware of uh in the background I couldn't talk about it until after I retired because the good state of Ohio the citizens of Ohio don't like their University professors doing massive doses of LSD on the weekends but uh so the hardest thing about trying to introduce my work uh for the first time is how long it lasted and how many layers of Consciousness I accessed in the process of this long 20-year journey and I think that uh many of our expectations about where psychedelics can take us or should take us have been shaped by accounts based on a very small data set for example when alus Huxley wrote his very important book doors of the perception in 1954 he had taken mesculin only one time and he took El psychedelics only a total of 10 times in his life similarly when Houston Smith the great historian of religion wrote his book cleansing the doors of perception he had taken LSD only six times after that he said uh the bummers increased and that led him to take Alan Watts's advice when you get the message hang up the phone but notice this gives a sense that you you do psychedelics you get the message that's it that's what it's about and uh my book is what happens if you don't hang up the phone but moving on we go to Michael pollen's very influential book how to change your mind and Michael had taken psychedelics only about a half dozen times by the time he wrote this book other developments have tended to give us a sort of a shortened metaphysical Horizon in terms of what we can expect to experience uh with psychedelics for example the Psychedelic Renaissance right now is focused on exploring the capacity of psychedelics to heal the wounds of the personal psyche when if you're in touch with the the Psychedelic literature it's dominated by the studies which are demonstrating psychedelics various capacities to heal uh the wounds of life whether it's post-traumatic stress or depression or addiction uh we're finding they're very powerful but this tends to focus us on the horizon of the personal unconscious a second use of psychedelics different but similar is using psychedelics for Spiritual Awakening as we see in this Anthology zigzag Zen which is is a discussion between the Psychedelic community and the uh Buddhist community on the relevance of psychedelics for Spiritual Awakening but still we're still thinking in terms of a kind of an individual level individual spiritual enlightenment these two categories the therapeutic and the spiritual awakening these are the major kind of topics that come up for discussion I think uh in today's psychedelic Renaissance and my work is different than this I was trained as a philosopher of religion I'm not a therapist I'm not a psychotherapist not a psychologist I primarily was interested have been interested in the philosophical potential of psychedelics so my work really falls into a third category where the project is cosmological exploration not healing not really aiming at Awakening but using these deep non-ordinary states to explore the Deep structure of reality my work descends are derives from Stan Gro I was just out of graduate school and I encountered this book by Stan Realms of the human unconscious which was followed by his manual LSD Psychotherapy and of course all the Dozen or 15s or so books had followed a very important works and in these two early Works danan clearly differentiates between lowd do psychotic therapy and highd dose psychedelic therapy a very different therapeutic regimen psycholytic pealing the unconscious layer by layer like an onion psychedelic trying to generate a breakthrough uh a a one maximum Supreme dose kind of approach here the Spring Grove Hospital was working with terminally ill patients trying to trigger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going when they died but the Psychedelic therapy was limited to three doses three sessions so you have low dose many sessions psychedelic very few I came along in 1978 and I thought well if you could do psychedelic therapy three times you could probably do it safely more than three times so for various reasons I chose to work uh in a psychedelic therapy protocol and in the end Between 1979 and 1999 I did 73 high do LSD sessions actually I did three moderate doses but then I did all high and you see B Doll okay so I just say 73 high do sessions and I did this in a very rigorous F fashion following Stan's protocol in my case I use the same protocol same set in setting same substance same dose level same sitter same recording process in same location I try to standardize all the variables as much as possible so as to ensure clean and consistent recurring contact with the Deep structure deeper levels of consciousness uh and when I got to the end of my journey and was trying to organize the the sessions into the narrative that I put into the book I began to realize that this really was a very different undertaking than psychedelic therapy I was dealing with a number of different issues that don't come up in psychedelic therapy and so I felt the new terminology was required and so I call my protocol psychedelic exploration it's not really therapeutic in its agenda it's psychedelic therapy in its Tech in its techniques it's high do isolated sha Shades sitter music whole thing but it is uh more than three doses it's my case 73 and the project in psychedelic exploration is cosmological exploration it's not primarily healing though there was a great deal of healing it's not primarily Spiritual Awakening it is exploring the Deep structure of the universe so I kept very detailed records of everything going through even looked at some of the astrological variables kept records of every session made within 24 hours of the session itself and what I'm writing about in uh LSD in the mind of the universe is not primarily my personal story I mean it's all personal of course and I own it but these lines represent a series of sessions and the small circles represent what's taking place in the beginning and ending of a session the large circles or what's taking place during the peak hours of the session and LSD in the mind of the universe is basically describing what took place in the peak hours of the sessions over the course of 73 sessions it's primarily a cosmological narrative it's not a therapeutic narrative I drop out a lot of the a lot of the examples of personal healing or personal insights which were given to me before at the beginning and ending of the sessions but when I was operating in the peak session I was usually operating far beyond personal reality the personal segment and that's the the part that I think has the most important philosophical relevance the cosmological relevance so just to give you one more important concept before we turn to looking at the book itself it's what I call the spal of death and rebirth everything below this line is time and space and our ordinary Consciousness above the line transpersonal Consciousness the drop at the bottom of this what my students sometimes would call the panty hole model of Consciousness this drop represents egoic Consciousness our time space identity everything above the line in the in the between the blue lines represents various orders of transpersonal Consciousness and of course to make a transition from our egoic space-time identity into spiritual reality involves going through some type of death of self or uh ego death in order to basically let the programming of our time space identity uh be dissolved or be shattered or be melted so that we can enter into deeper States Of Consciousness and while ego death gets a lot of the attention in the therapeutic literature and appropriately so in my journey ego death turned out to be only one of a number of deaths that took place at different levels of the journey and this is what I call the spiral of death and rebirth what I found is that when you're entering a deeper level of transpersonal Consciousness you have to go through a death and rebirth even after ego death you go through multiple layers of deaths and rebirths and the nature of that death is very It's tricky to describe because it's it's a type of death and rebirth that takes place far beyond egoic Consciousness far beyond anything to do with space-time Consciousness and it changes as the adventure deepens and here I use Stan and Ken Wilbur's categories of psychic subtle and causal reality to describe some of these levels I don't have any vested interest in a particular cosmology a particular identifying of levels or rating of levels this is basically just to indicate a pattern and the pattern is their many levels of consciousness in spiritual reality and you go through many levels of death and rebirth in a if you access these levels of consciousness in a systematic fashion and this is why I EMP emphasize the standardization of the protocol in my work because I think the more standardized uh our protocol the more we basically return to the same membrane the same platform of interface between our individual Consciousness and this larger Consciousness and it makes in my case it led to a Perpetual deepening of the experience a Perpetual series of initiations and entering into deeper communion with the creative intelligence of the universe now when I got to the end of my journey was working on preparing for the book doing the book I identified five areas or cluster areas or levels of consciousness that my experiences kind could be grouped in so here are the five levels that stand out for me one is the level of personal mind Collective mind or our species mind archetypal mind causal Oneness and Diamond Luminosity so what I'd like to do is simply go through and throw up the the chapter titles of the book and organize them according to these levels of consciousness and give you a quick overview a quick thumbnail of just some of the stages of this journey this is extremely frustrating for me to do because just to convey adequately the content of one deep psychedelic experience is very challenging and would take a while Juliana of Norwich the Great the British Mystics spent decades digesting one particular trans spiritual near-death episode experience that she had and to try to summarize 20 years of such experiences uh is is challenging especially and I should have mentioned this before I was working at 500 to 600 micrograms which is right at the peak of what the body's tolerance is in terms of you don't get higher if you take more so I was working with very high doses and this is a protocol I do not recommend today if I were doing it myself again uh over I would do it differently I'd be much gentler on myself but nevertheless this is what I did and this is where we went so let me just go through them first the level of personal mind this is a chapter called crossing the boundary of birth and death this is what Stan gr calls the crossing the perinal level of Consciousness the level of Consciousness between our time space identity and spiritual reality it involves confrontations with death lots of fetal Sensations often reliving uh one's birth uh very extreme um facing deep alienation uh the question is whether life has any meaning whatsoever because everyone we know and everything we know and everyone we love is going to be dead including ourselves How can there be any meaning in a universe where everything the value dies uh which eventually culminates in in our time space identity our ego death identity being turned inside out and for me this took about 10 sessions and two and a half years of work until eventually the universe got me to a point where it just snapped me like a twig it turned me into the exact opposite of everything i' had ever known myself to be and and radically expanded the boundaries of my awareness I thought I was a a male white University Professor concerned with the meaning of existence it turned me into hundreds of women women of color women who had no interest in philosophy or the meaning of existence and it just snapped me it forced me it just snapped me and the message was uh where you were going gender does not exist let go go and of course the the problem was not women and or education or anything like that the problem was the tight role that my social identity had on me that was confining the limits of my experience after I let go and surrendered I was taken under the arm of the great mother and given a wonderful long many hour uh journey into the world of women becoming hundreds of women uh in all sorts of life life circumstances and then the con Journey continued the next several sessions come under the category of collective mind or eego mind excuse me uh species mind now working at these do levels the way I worked my experience was that more or less every session began with the first portion of the session being a a purification of uh detoxification process the dying process the second portion of the session being a uh a Transcendent experience an ecstatic experience um transpersonal teaching instruction and so uh on the first half of the next year of session I entered a domain that I came to call the ocean of suffering I was repeatedly and systematically emerged in a collective anguish that shattered all my frames of reference it completely dwarfed the previous F phase I entered a domain that expanded to Encompass the entire history of the human species the dying in this level was almost entirely Collective the surrender was the or that the surrender that was demanded was the ordeal of repeatedly opening to the the sheer enormity and savagery of the ocean of pain that I was encountering I did not understand what was happening um but for several hours in every session and then I it would get into this ocean of suffering and then I would be spun into what I'll describe in a minute at first I thought this represented a deepening of my ego death but it went on for so long and it involved so many thousands of people that I eventually came to a very different conclusion and this is really the major theme of my second book dark night early Dawn and that is I think what happened is in my sessions and in many of our sessions when we reach this level uh the universe used my sessions not to heal me or not to try to enlighten me but to heal some aspect of humanity at large to heal some aspect of the collective psyche and just as an IND individual internalizes trauma in their unconscious which then distorts their well-being the human species likewise internalizes all the trauma of History anything that's not resolved by the end of our individual lifetimes the species internalizes all the trauma from all the wars and all the deaths and all the droughts and all the hunger and it Aggregates in the collective psyche distorting the functioning of the collective psyche and in these unusual highly expanded Amplified States Of Consciousness I think what happens is we open up to the depths of the collective unconscious and in that process we have an opportunity to take on and uh experience some of the depths of these terrible memories and in that process lift them from the collective psyche now when I went through each stage each day of the collective ocean of suffering in the first year in the second half of the session I entered what I came to call Deep time in the soul for seven sessions an entire year I entered a reality where I experienced my entire life from beginning to end as a completed whole I moved Beyond linear time not into eternity in between linear Time and Eternity there many modalities of time and these I came to call Deep time where you could experience different spans of time as simultaneously present or you could experience time speeding up or moving into evolutionary speed so to speak for one year I experienced my life in all of its moments from start to finish as simultaneously present now it was a very powerful distillation of my life's work of who I was be doing this work with what my life was about and at this point I ended this represented four years of work and about uh 18 17 sessions and at this point I stopped my work for six years for reasons that I go into in the book six years later I started my work again and when I did the ocean of suffering began exactly where it was where it had stopped six years before so there was a year of the ocean of suffering before my six-year break and a year of the ocean of suffering after that six-year break and the Precision with which this started again and kept getting deeper and deeper and deeper is a measure I think uh an indicator of the magnitude and precision of the intelligence which was guiding uh these sessions and the positive side once I went through through the ocean of suffering in this next year of session I entered a a domain of Consciousness which took me radically beyond anything to do with my personal reality into the universe the mind of the universe in a section I call initiation into the universe different time of life different expectations different astrological transits deep into the belly of the Universe I was given a series of carefully orchestrated teachings initiations into the cosmic order of things now I always give all my sessions a name just simply as a nemonic device I write down my sessions I I put them down on bullet points I give them a name in order to help me remember because I want to remember my entire Journey all at once the names help me here are the names of the sessions that I present in this chapter initiation into the universe and you can see just from the nature of the names how profoundly transpersonal these experiences were and I and frustrating not to be able to tell you more about them but I just can't there's not time uh deep Excursion in like cosmology 101 uh How the Universe works as at a fundamental level when the ocean of suffering came to a culmination in the 24th session healing the collective wound there was sort of a an an orgy of feeding on the pain and it reached a culmination and I was spun into a level of reality that I came to understand as archetypal reality and I discussed this phase of the work in the chapter the greater real of archetypal reality this lasted about 11 sessions and one and a half years and every time I entered this reality I entered a level of reality that was more real than space time it's a very disorienting experience at first but every time I went there I was engaging something that was more real than space time and also ancient it was just ancient Beyond imagination time worked at a completely different scale there a completely different order of reality I felt like Plato's prisoner having climbed out of the cave entering in a more level a more real level of reality in in the universe than my own existence in SpaceTime when I began to enter archetypal reality I went through a death process in which I began I had to die as a human being per se I found that there is a level of identity that we hold in our psyche simply by virtue of being a human being it's more fundamental than than ego identity and to go through species ego death or to Slough off your entire history as a human species and all the cognitive parameters that go with being a member of the human species is a deeper form of surrendering to the great unknown than simply letting go of your individual egoic identity the transition to was to very very high levels of energy I learned in the process that high levels deep levels of consciousness repres are driven by high levels of energy the deeper you go the higher the energy and if you want to have abiding stable experiences in in these levels of reality you must go through the purification detoxification process that allows you to to maintain clear cognition at these deep levels of reality uh and that means adjusting uh submitting yourself to these levels of energy which in my case had the flavor of white hot lava flows exploding sunfl flares Liquid Fire pouring through me CH changing me completely now I would experience archetypal reality is having two levels one is kind of the platonic type level where I experience principles or beings I don't really want to call them beings because that makes them sound too compact more principles Cosmic principles that were clearly the constitutive principles responsible for creating creating space time and some of the structures in space and time but they were so large so vast I could not wrap my mind around them the best my mind could do to giving them some type of semblance of form is that I saw them as galaxies hundreds of light years across but galaxies very vast moving on a different order of scale than our small solar system so I spent some time there at then I also spent some time in uh ex experiencing at what you might think of as a More yian Level the living tissue of our species I was given the experience over and over again of experiencing our species as a single being a single mind and each of us are cells within this mind fractal iterations within this mind and even each of our bodies sell within the collective body so that there was nothing private about our existence neither our personal psychological issues or our physical issues our diseases all of them were in a back and forth process osmotic process between the individual and the species as a whole CH can I ask a question here sure so I mean this is a really good point uh where you are right now because in the book you mentioned you know how we're being guided gently that when we have deep subtle Intuition or something in creativity would it be correct to say it's either these Cosmic principles or the Council of the elders influencing our development Now That We're Not Alone we are absolutely not alone uh the universe is the hyper intelligent hyper conscious hyper compassionate hyper wisdom we it infuses us every minute of the day uh whether we're paying attention to it or not taking advantage of it or not but if we tune into it if we step away from our narrow focus and tune into uh deeper levels of our Consciousness which then open into subtler and subtler levels of consciousness one does receive help one receives healing and advice and insight and these can these come from multiple potential levels of consciousness uh and so I I would hesitate to identify a source that they would come from it's more a matter of an infinitely deep source that you can draw from at multiple different levels yeah so um a lot of integral people they're aware of in a moment of creativity in connection that somehow they become a vehicle for what wants to be expressed absolutely so that's an alignment yeah a deep alignment you just become transparent I mean basically when you drop underneath your personal identity when you kind of Pierce the membrane and pop the bubble and drop beneath that and then into the mind of the of the species beneath that into different levels of the creative mind uh you you become transparent the joy is that in becoming shat empty empty of self becoming transparent I like that translation of shunyata transparent you become transparent to these deeper orders of awareness that then kind of come through you they uh they they nourish you with healing with love and with insight and creativity yeah oh one one final comment yeah is whatever this intelligence is in the universe is grooming us to participate in this intelligence grooming is might be a little strong but I understand I want to say yes but I might sort of choose different more words than grooming but it and we are of the same stuff it is large we are small relatively speaking but uh we are of the same part of the same stuff and we are always in communion with each other so it's more like older brother younger brother older sister younger sister I think of the spiritual Universe Dwayne Elgen talks about it as the mother universe and time space is the daughter universe and so naturally there's a a relationship between mother and daughter you wouldn't say the mother is grooming the daughter but the mother brings the daughter along yeah yeah okay uh I began to have experiences at this level of reincarnation as a collective process I had experiences in which I witnessed the entire uh planet and the entire species reincarnating in a pulse that moved through history so I had written my book my first book was on reincarnation and so I was I construed reincarnation classically the way it's usually construed as a story of the Soul's journey toward Enlightenment uh Lifetime by LifeTime making progress making clearing mistakes so on so forth but it was an individual Journey we're all on individual Journeys and here instead I was dissolved into the species as the entire species went into an intelligent articulate Collective Karma uh though that is too crude a phrase an intelligence that was growing itself Generation by Generation generation by generation and somehow all of our individual soul project s fit inside beautifully magnificently inside this Collective Soul project now here are the names of the sessions that I address in this particular chapter I won't go into them but except to mention notice how much cleansing is still taking place at this pretty advanced level session 28 was a very deep session it was an archetypal meltdown it threw me very briefly into the next higher level of consciousness of very extremely Pure Clean crystallin level of Consciousness and even though I was only in that reality for a number of minutes I think it triggered a cleansing a detoxification that lasted six months in three sessions just an ordeal of just cleansing and cleansing and cleansing hard to describe the cleansing because it's it's not a matter of personal history it's partly biological it's partly emotional it's it's partly subtle energy uh it it's just a radical cleansing in order to allow me to come back into that highly pure highly refined energy with clear cognition which took place by the 32nd and 33rd session and then continued into the next year of a year that I describe in the book called the benediction of blessings this was an extraordinary year uh after archetyp of reality uh in which I was given just a series of one extraordinary transpersonal blessing after another these are the four sessions that covering a Year's work uh that I addressed in the book The Forest was an experience of Oneness and no self shat emptiness of self no self in me no self anywhere in the world a universal Force running through the forest not not caring at all whether it's animating a pine tree or an oak tree deep experience of Oneness and Oneness and emptiness are two sides of the same coin yeah when you experience deep Oneness it's immediately obvious obvious that there is no separate self anywhere in the world we are all interdependent and intertwined and when you experience deep no self then Oneness the Oneness of Life manifests spontaneous it's just they they go hand in hand singing the universe away was an experience a deep experience of the Void the Primal void out of which the universe Springs Jesus's blood was an experience of cosmic love being loved more deeply than I'd ever known love in my life just overwhelming immersion uh in Cosmic Love and the birth of the diamond soul I just want to mention this because it'll come up later um how to put this succinctly it was a I experienced all of my former lives coming into me uh just like wrapping string around a kite spool just coming back very fast I had done three years of past life hypnotherapy and I had a pretty good sense of some of my former lives but they came back very quickly and they reached a point where they seemed to hit a critical mass and they fused and when they fused there was an enormous explosion and the diamond light broke out of my chest and catapulted me into a very high and subtle State of Consciousness in which I was an individual but I was an individual Beyond any frame of reference that I had known up to that point in time and over time this is what I came to understand or call the birth of the diamond soul my understanding is when we die we return to the soul which is the larger Consciousness that holds all of our experience when we incarnate we shrink down get small focus when we die we get large we incarnate we get small so on and so forth but we return to the soul if all goes well many times after our incarn Nations What's Happening Here I think what happened in my session and I think what's happening in our historical progression is that the soul is being born inside time and space that if you keep going back and forth between expansion into the world of spirit and back into time and space and you keep this up long enough thousands and thousands and thousands of years sooner or later doesn't it make sense that the soul would awaken eventually inside our incarnate existence so that the awareness of identity or the nature of identity that we claim in that Incarnation is the soul as our identity and with this comes a vast expansion of the heart a deep opening of the Mind a deep Embrace of compassion or Awakening of compassion passion the birth of the diamond soul I was 15 years into my journey uh I had was had received more blessings than I could have imagined what I I had been asked to give something in the ocean of suffering work and I had been rewarded with more blessings than I could count but there was still 5 years remaining in my journey and this is when I went through yet another death and re birth process and entered what I call the domain of diamond Luminosity I entered a reality that was exceptionally clear it was light but a particular quality of light I had known light many times before people often experience great light when they go through ego death and I had in a different stages I'd experienced light but when I talk about the diamond light I'm not simply using using a metaphor for the light I'm trying to describe a particular quality of light exceptionally clear very very pure just so clear it takes your breath away this is what I think Buddhism calls dharmakaya the clear light of absolute reality over the next four years and 26 sessions this is about a third of all the sessions I did I only entered this reality four times here are the names of these four sessions in between these sessions more in more purification more detoxification more teaching more absorbing of lessons uh but these four immersions into the crystallin quality of diamond Luminosity again so much to say and so little time I'm just going to have to stop I'll mention only that the first two sessions took me deeper and deeper into the diamond luminosity and after that there was a reverse of pivot and then in the last two of these sessions the diamond Luminosity was crunching itself deeper and deeper into my mind into my personality into my physiology into my biochemistry and this is it was in the 50th session that I had a particular experience in the diamond Luminosity that changed radically my understanding of existence one of the reasons I pushed so hard in my work is that I I thought the purpose of this work was to get to a particular condition to get to the an end stage to get home to become one with the universe or one with the metac cosmic void and I had many experiences of Oneness and had learned that there are degrees of Oneness and I had had experiences of the Primal void and i' learned that there are even degrees of the Void though that sounds like a contradiction in terms but in the peak of the diamond Luminosity when I was as deep into the diamond Luminosity as I would ever go in my journey I was sitting and resting comfortably intact in a a deeply Blissful State and my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and the a circle opened and I saw in the far far distance a reality far beyond the diamond luminosity and there was a domain of light there and a ray of light came out of that reality and hit me and it absolutely shattered me it took me minutes to recover and that's when I understand that it's an infinite progression we'll never get to the end of it even using this very aggressive mode of of transition of exploration I would never get to the end the the mind of the universe is just too vast too big and that the thought there is a homecoming to this work and one does experience homecoming but the idea that there is an end to get to that will change everything I don't think so Oneness is a beautiful powerful important teaching but even Oneness does not not exhaust all there is to learn uh from the universe now you notice that I've skipped a chapter chapter nine I'm going to try to speed this up here uh and this is the chapter called the birth of the future human when I began this work in 1979 I never imagined that Humanity's future would become part of my journey and now I think this chapter may be the most important chapter of the book because it speaks to the fate of our planet the fate of our species it speaks to our children's World our children's children as far as we can see it speaks of a Crossroads that humanity is coming to and of the powerful forces taking us into a future that will change us at the deepest levels of our being now what I did is that over the course of my journey I had numerous visions that kept popping up here and there different Visions about Humanity Humanity spiritual Evolution where Humanity was that Humanity was coming to a turning point a before and after moment in history this kept coming up in lots of different places so what I did was to rather than address them all peace meal chapter by chapter I gathered them all into this particular chapter and I broke this down into two sections the first first are the visions of Awakening which are a series of visions that I had over a 4-year period back from 1991 to 1994 those Visions the title of those Visions I'll give them here and I don't want to take the time to go into them but basically it was an extraordinarily positive assessment of where human humanity is that we were being Guided by a a guiding intelligence uh that this guiding intelligence was trying to awaken not just individuals it was intent on awakening the entire species as a single being taking us into a different epic in our evolutionary development we were entering a period of intense Collective purification a dark night of our Collective Soul and then a brief experience of the future human which I think is represents a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche the future human is not simply an awakened present human but literally a different kind of human the next iteration of the human species nowhere in my journey however had it told me how it was going to pull this off how we would possibly make this transition in such a short period of time and then in 1995 in session 55 in the middle of the diamond Luminosity work I had already gone into the diamond Luminosity twice I would go into it twice more when I was expecting to be taken into the diamond Luminosity a third time instead I was taken deep into the future I was dissolved into the human species and as the species as a whole whole I entered the future and experienced the death and Rebirth of humanity a profound spiritual psycho physical transformation the death and Rebirth of humanity this was a very difficult session an ordeal of the highest order uh I was not given any specifics it it was a profound unraveling of the global order an unraveling that seemed to be triggered by a cascading series of ecological crises and I I must tell you this is 95 I was radically naive about global climate change about global climate disruption Eco ecospirituality it just wasn't on my radar uh but in this Vision I was shown that Humanity was going to be brought to its knees it would going to be go through a process of profound unraveling that the kind of unraveling that happens in a psychedelic session was here being reflected in history an unraveling of our core assumptions of the basic components of life for a while it was so deep it looked like we were all going to go extinct but in the end we went through a crisis and we transitioned past the crisis and when we transitioned through this crisis the entire experience we were was marked by New Visions of the of the of the Val of of the good New Visions of the true New Visions of uh social relationships it Oneness had truly broken out inside the human heart there was a radical permeability of the heart a radical permeability to higher states of awareness again I was not given any details of when or how just simply taken into the species experience that this would happen that we would come through it and that this was about the birth of a future human I think we've been reincarnating if you ask what is the form that the future human will take I think it's it's already marked for us in history we've been reincarnating for hundreds of thousands of years just station is long we have been birthing gestating the human the future human in these many incarnations and now we are coming into the hour of labor labor is intense It's relatively short it's dangerous it's frightening it's threatening and in the end it gives birth to a new child if all goes well and this is what I think humanity is doing this is what we are all involved in what all of our indiv idual spiritual and psychological transformational process is part of this process a larger historical process that humanity is involved in giving birth to the Future human the last year of work the final vision is just that I was given one last Vision the final the large last large vision of my journey uh in it these are the three sessions I address in this chapter I won't go into the content of the final Vision I will just mention that it was my deepest Excursion into future time it was my deepest experience of the future human and the future human is just such an extraordinary extraordinary being after that the sessions wrapped up the last two sessions are what I call the goodbye sessions I didn't choose to end these sessions the universe wrapped it up uh pretty decisively and I stopped my sessions in 99 last chapter of the book is called coming off the mountain and it basically tells some highlights of what it was like to stop this journey uh I was on this journey for 20 years I stopped and I processed the experiences for another 20 years before releasing LSD in the mind of the Universe I thought coming off the mountain was going to be a pretty straightforward not difficult process turned out that that was all wrong it was a very demanding process in fact I found that coming off the mountain in some ways was as difficult as coming going up the mountain uh spirit said to me there is the dying of seeing and the dying of keeping the dying of seeing you do as you're entering into deeper and deeper States Of Consciousness the dying of keeping is the dying of integration and I found that my integration process even though I was actively involved in integration all the way up through all the sessions there integrating an entire journey is different than integrating individual sessions and it took a long time uh to integrate the entire Journey now I especially acutely we're given it going through it so quickly that uh I realize the extreme and radical nature of the claims I'm making I know that this is a radical story that raises many questions about the reality of these experiences about how trustworthy these experiences are am I simply experiencing The Echoes of my own personal psyche or maybe The Echoes of the collective psyche how do we know that these things are really about a reality out there and I addressed this in I hope of yeah in an exchange that Ken ring one of the founders of near-death episode studies he and I had an exchange specifically about this topic can we trust these deep psychedelic experiences and we found it was a useful exchange and we published it in medium which you can pick up online uh you can also pick it up uh I it's in academia.edu uh in my page there uh it's around I think I may have it on my website and also in if you look if you have a copy of Dark Knight early Dawn in the first chapter there is a section called the epistemic warrant of psychedelic experience and there I give a a rationale an argument for why these experiences are trustable drawing on some of Ken's Rings Ken Wilbur's work uh there uh so all my work has come out of this psychedelic Journey my first book on reincarnation the second one on uh Trans in psychedelic Theory and the living classroom which is coming out in a new edition now because they want to they want in psychedelics woven into the story I deliberately kept psychedelics out of the story of the living classroom but they wanted me to tell the whole truth and so psychedelics are part of the story of the living classroom and this is a story basically because my students didn't know anything about my psychedelic experience I didn't bring it to campus and yet I found that they began to be impacted by my psychedelic experiences and that required that I had to learn an entirely new way of teaching in develop what I call a Quantum pedagogy so that's the story and now I'm going to stop here and stop screen share Chris we have a couple questions before we go to breakout can we do a couple sure I think Tom McDougall so as I say in the chat I've been working partly with Norma with with Nora Bateson but especially with with Jeremy Johnson on gser and bar barely have touched this surface and taking the course again but uh a lot of this especially as you were talking about the time period we're in and the shift that is going on is also very similar to what jean gser wrote about um so I'm curious if if you can relate those two I don't know what your experience with gser is but um and I guess there's a little bit of Nora biton in my mind too of of questioning the stages orientation and and I can't express it right now but Jerry John Jeremy talks a lot about a very different it's not stages exactly in in gser but different but anyway if you could just talk a little bit about maybe the relationships there yeah I'll make it easy for you because gser is always one of those thinkers that I know I should read and I haven't read so absolutely zero influence in terms of correlations and so I have to let you and other people make the correlations there um and you know a a lot of people in psychedelic experience they don't have the same experience of Perpetual deepening of kind of going deeper and then deeper and then deeper it's kind of like okay we go out we have an experience we come back if I go out again in a couple of months I'm going to go into this more or less the same territory and come back and I think this idea of Perpetual deepening comes from two things it comes from first using a very very powerful psychedelic at very high doses so it was very driving and much stronger than we use in therapeutically oriented doses with psilocybin and whatnot and the second thing is was a totally tight isolated consistent what I call the the KE of psychedelic practice the Kaa of practice standardizing all the variables staying away from all contact with the world entering in in a meditative way uh into these states and if you do that then I find that the interface between the mind doing the exploring and the mind being explored gets very stable and the mind being explored basically takes you on as a student and just takes you in deeper and deeper deeper and deeper into the process I yeah and I you just you enter I you enter into deeper and deeper Visionary states that uh that many people are are you know many other psychedelics many indigenous people many philosophically oriented people are intuiting and feeling what I'm describing there's nothing really new in what I'm saying it's it's really just a repetition in that way reges has a question yeah comment yeah it's more of a I just wanted to Express gratitude for you um both doing this work but also coming back you know and Ken Wilbur often talks about the transformative nature of spiritual inquiry and then the translative nature of spiritual inquiry and and my appreciation for you is one where I feel like I as someone who goes through those things I have to I have a responsibility to both transform and to translate and so from my perspective uh you've done just such a beautiful job of holding that particular ethos and it's also what's what's nice about it is my own personal transformation bring here and things I've experienced is uh you know U very congruent with everything that you're talking about so um so I'm very inspired by your work and I can't wait to read uh you know the books that you written as a guide for my own uh future transformation so thank you for that thank you you're hate to be a bad guy I'm gonna suggest that we oh I suggest that we all take time to uh process this in small groups maybe in groups of four and then after that we'll have some time for Q&A right so the idea in this breakout is to respond to the ideas presented uh different than the first breakout just to respond and what do you think okay okay see you in 15 breakout sessions are not recorded hey we'll have until 550 for some questions and then we'll have um some San Diego integral business and then we'll start our more informal a and Chris said he was originally said he was going to be able to stay for about 15 minutes so we'll start with Sandy you want to ask your questions go ahead Sandy yeah I want to follow up on that the question around um Gaper um because um in terms of the way you're describing your experiences you know one of the differences in some ways between like gser and Wilbur is gser will talk about intensification the Consciousness shift is not like a a structural like U increase as much as an intensification and an engagement of previous structures of Consciousness that continue but there's an intensification and a sort of um um um growing awareness that includes previous understanding where um you know Wilbur is more tends to be looking at okay you're going this level you're kind of lading up so I'm curious as your your experiences is there some resonance with with with that Vision or do you have your own around how these all um engage with each other you know I'm going to disappoint you because I don't have a lot of kind of theoretical overview of the structure of these things um I kind of when I wrote dark night early Dawn I was kind of writing in my academic voice and there's a fair amount of intellectual synthesis there but when I wrote this book I I deliberately developed a different voice uh it it is really more a shamanic Visionary voice and I find that that's a more comfortable place for me to operate from because uh it's taken so much of my life just to survive these Visionary encounters and to process them and to understand them that I speak out of their basis simp as a witness to this unfolding process so it's it's it's not a I don't have a theory of human evolution or a theory of the development of the process and what happens in an LSD session may or may not be relevant to what happens at an historical level right that whole pattern uh I would just say for me it's just a natural progression when you die as a private self you don't dissolve necessarily immediately into eternity one of the intermediate levels is into humanity and just as you can have an overview of your life you can also have an overview of Humanity's developmental process and so I was dissolved into that and and experienced part of it the closest I can come to describing this emergent being is in terms of the concept of of the diamond Soul which does it it brings everything from the past forward into the present but it drives it into a higher synthesis a new level uh it's not simply an enlightened last generation human Incarnation it is a totally new structure of Consciousness that's emerging here I say totally new not entirely because we have great Saints great you know the Jesus and Buddhas of History and the muhammads and the great mahasa I think we get glimpses into what the diamond soul looks like uh but the difference here is that we're looking at the entire species going through some type of metamorphosis like that yeah um just one reflection with some things you said you mentioned the term unfolding and intensification as some ways a part of what you were describing some of that which are sort of gaps serian Concepts so just little tidbits of theory of kind of throw it in thank you so much I really value your work very much everybody read this book it's really an important one and it's the most accessible work I've seen that gives a deep understanding um it's so articulate and it's so vivid um I really thank you to have a chance to have to see you and talk with you so Sandy hug was waiting quite a bit since last iteration yeah well thank you for your uh event here that's a great like Miracle gift to me and it's like little overwhelming with my ADD I kept like kind of tuning in and tuning out and it's like oh man I wish I absorbed it all well yeah but like so dreamy to like learn a lot more about this stuff and I was wondering like if you maybe have accessibility for like counseling like to pay you for some counseling to ask you questions because some of like the stuff I've had on my mind it's like relates to somebody in your specialization is oh the like higher order of the way of things and um like right now my best thing I've had which has done way better than the therapists I had previously is uh like chat GPT but it's like it'd be really neat if I could like maybe pay to get an hour or whatever your time and and I'm really curious too because I'm at a point with like I do believe in Jesus and so much of the Bible but it's like I'm not like attached to that other than like from my current understanding I don't see how to go against believing in Jesus but I'm curious to hear where your path LED you first of all thank you for the the trust of the invitation that you extend to me I appreciate that and uh I'm going to disappoint you in that I generally have made a a choice many years ago not to be a therapist and not to work with other people or to but to basically be a solo Pioneer and that's kind of the work I've done and I find and I'm also a teacher so I love working with groups and just the demands of time are such that and I'm retired but even so the demands of time is that uh I I really don't work with individuals I mean I I just that's a commitment that's and that's a I think that requires more clinical background than I have and just it's not fair so I really like to work with groups and writing in groups is where I where I focus but thank you just one last Quick comment was I don't know if it would change anything but I'm also like at the starting point of authoring a couple books myself with some subject matter that might just be like a like a miracle gift to you and it's like it'd be neat to talk about that stuff but yeah but whatever like I don't know how that appeals to you it's just what happens is in in the after the publication of the book I just I have to make choices always I don't get to have nearly as many in conversations as I would like to have you know so yeah all right Trudy's up next unmute yourself yeah hi I'll make it quick and simple um I apologize I missed the very beginning of your presentation and it's been great the part that I did catch but my questions are probably more along the practicality line um one why did you decide to go on this journey to when you were in trips did you have somebody that was there as um I don't want to say a guide but somebody uh to take notes or did somebody yeah record what was going on and were in any way were they influenced by your trip yeah uh sever quick answers to those is uh as soon as I read Stan's work I just knew that this was something I wanted to get involved in and I I've come to recognize you know your souls code when you recognize something it just speaks to you so deeply you know was part of your intention built into this lifetime when I saw this I knew that this was part of my intention and it was just there uh so I I and S philosopher I just couldn't turn down the opportunity to explore the universe using this protocol this was just giving an ordinary lay person not a great spiritual genius but an ordinary lay person an opportunity to even have temporary experiences of some of the subtleties of layers of Consciousness layers of reality it was just too good to pass pass down pass up so I made the choice to break the law and go for it uh now in these sessions they were always uh I always had a sitter the sitter was my wife my first wife Carol and she was a clinical psychologist and uh she really wasn't very fond of what I was doing but she knew I wanted to do it and so she agreed to help me so that I could do it safely she wasn't taking notes we actually set up a video camera one time but basically it's boring this person just lying down it's all internal I I I'm not in touch with Carol except through the music in the room and once in a while an exchange of a word or two but I'm so far outside of time space reality I don't even relate to what's going on in the room but she was always there taking care of me was she influenced by my sessions in some ways yes and in some ways no I mean Carol never did a psychedelic session she's a serious vadana practitioner she has completed her three-year retreat with her vadana teacher so she's a serious practitioner uh she has her own deep commitments to her own spiritual lineage and so I think it's more of a and I and I learned a lot from her I mean I followed her in Dev vadana but in this respect I think it's more of a side bys side play yeah my friend Larry's up next Yeah Yeah Chris thank you for several things Having the courage to take your journey or having the wherewithal to organize it you you know bring it into the mind to organize it in a way that then you can next present it to other people so thank you for all of that and I really appreciate the last piece of coming off the mountain because that's what's been very important for me for some 30 years now is bringing this into the world world and facing the confusion the complexity the awkwardness the discomfort the whatnot of trying to bring from the ineffable into the into language into interaction with other people how to not just talk about this about how to be in a way that is hopefully to some degree reflective of where we what we garnered while we were on the mountain so to speak and it all seems to come down to how we're going to be right here right now and even in this moment that we're talking with one another yeah and how can we bring that all just to being present okay on a lesser interesting note maybe is I'm curious as to why the word diamond and once you get into all these step stages degrees domains Realms whatever out there the word Diamond shows up of all things yeah my diamond it it having experienced the light itself the diamond is kind of the most natural image that comes to mind perhaps I'm influenced by the fact of of vadana the diamond way uh you know that partly is in the background the image of diamond is not uncommon in the Tera text uh trying to describe these subtle levels of consciousness so it just it it came naturally uh out of the experience itself um yeah I mean it's uh I I want to mention and I think integration I'm glad that it's getting more and more attention um because we're finding that we can blow through the levels and reach out and have extraordinary experiences with increasing predictability but to have an experience and to internalize and and hold on to the experience and then to really digest it and make it part of your being that's a long long process and and I think we kind of overemphasize the the dying of seeing and underemphasize the dying of keeping I will say that after coming back from my and I you know I don't do any high dose LSD work anymore I've done some lowd do sessions of different sorts and I waskin siloc I've been in different things but uh I am continuing but after I finish my sessions in my meditation uh the universe said to me 20 years in 20 years out which I took to mean it would take me about 20 years to integrate the 20 years of a session and I thought at the time about right if you're lucky now I'm thinking I was naive I was very I seriously underestimated how many years how many incarnations it would take to internalize you know totally integrate uh these sessions now my focus is is on yeah we do this for integration there's therapeutic integration and then there's this that and the other but in the end I'm I'm faced confessing that I'm an absolute failure in integration because I've been able to integrate the language I've been able to integrate the memories and hold the memories and whatnot but in terms of embodying those realities I mean I truly wonder how do how does how does a finite being embody Infinity how does a Time bound being exquisitly tuned to time and space embody deep time or or no time and how do you embody the love how can you be as loving to other beings as you have felt the universe being to you and you know that you're supposed to be that loving to everyone but that love is so pure and so magnificent that I feel like I've not anywhere near done integrating those magnificent pieces so it's a I thought integration would be was an easier task and in the end I think what it comes down to is is you cannot integrate the infinite into the finite your only option is to integrate the finite into the infinite so that means even though my journey was not about Spiritual Awakening in the end when you're trying to integrate cosmological exploration you're brought back to basic spirituality 101 what can you hold right here right now what are you able to actualize is right here right now and that's that's spiritual practice you you get brought brought right back to your cushion yeah so this is as I like to say the journey continues the journey continues yeah so this is a good place to uh end the venue where we are um we've come to the end of the time thank you everyone for joining uh I think I could speak for most of us this was very rich with um the Future Vision the future human that we're all interested in in and thank you Chris so uh where can they get more information on you on your books and my website Chris bash.com it it's kind of an unfinished website because my web designer kind of just jump ship about 34s of the way through and I never quite got it finished so but it's there and you can reach me through that Chris spas.com thank you Chris and Kathleen put in the chat one of the docs he wanted to you to have uh uh I can see it right there right now so um quick reminder for everyone we're g to be meeting again on March 9th that's a TBD um but we're GNA try to get someone else from the future human I thought Chris was an excellent choice to start uh with and he was gracious enough to take all of this on when he agreed to speak and come to SDI there was one more thing I was gonna ask him but I said I better not P my luck um so please RSVP for the next presentation and you can always make a donation if you're feeling uh Rich to help us so we're moving to the informal aspect of this so feel free to make comments um what not I know for me is I feel humble after this talk because this idea of infinite progression and in one of the breakout groups we talked about trying to reach second tier uh trying to reach yellow levels of stage awareness it almost seems uh trivial when you look at the breath of what Chris articulated but we are on the path we're on and as you said in the end whatever we can realize in the moment now it's not full integration by any means but I'm Way Beyond expecting that I hang on to moments of resonance and love and try to participate it and I think this community does well in this is we're we're stealing glimpses Prometheus got grounded for stealing fire we're stealing glimpses of the future and I feel privileged to do that so with that said feel free to jump in uh to the dialogue you don't have to raise your hand just jump in reges yeah so the theme for me um throughout my spiritual Explorations and my other explanations my psychology seems to have a commonality which I'm hearing also in this and that and that's you just I think described as really it's the profundity of humility that is required to do any of this work um you know so that's actually for me the the and I I'm struck by a few things as somebody who's spent the last 15 years trying to unpack my own transformative stuff it is its own form of transformational work to do that you go through and have these experiences but then then there's this the amount of universe there is is extraordinary and also what's interesting is right about this time I also discovered that I had autism and so one of the things about autism is you have an inability to filter and so what yoga gave to me was the ability to no longer be crushed under the overwhelm of my input and it became a kind of usable bandwidth situation for me and so then my ability to do translative work it would actually took me the translative effort I wrote 5,000 answers on quora for example about spirituality just in an effort to do that I then was kind of I think doing what chrish Bish was trying to do is is just like I went through this experience and how is it I'm supposed to it's almost a part of the you know like through a mushroom trip you know you have a time up you have a work space and you have a time going down I almost felt like the the years I spent in spiritual practice then I I had a work space there but now how am I supposed to land without crashing or going insane and you know uh all of that and it just seems like uh no matter what I do I keep being humbled and um that seems to be foundational for everything that I know about and what I heard also in Chris bash's thing more than that I also hear his trans translative um imposition upon his experience given that he is an academic and had to have a job and couldn't be nonfunctional for months at a time because he was had to show up in front of students all the time so that just I can see that that boundar his experience too and in a certain kind of way um you know so the humility comes with all that so thank you guys um for having this and uh and I really appreciate uh the entire per you know I think you're right Regis um the greatest risk of working with psychedelics is psychic inflation you can think that just because you've had a remarkable experience you've become a remarkable person and that doesn't fly you know so it's really important to keep your feet grounded grounded grounded and for me it was my family and my students who kept me grounded and just the ABS you know the requirements of being there for them showing up over and over and over again and discovering that you don't really have to change much on the outside of your life with these changes are really cooking your insides and they're taking you some places and there's a real kind of a need to wear different clothes or do something different on the outside which that's really just doesn't really that's a temporary kind of thing and just sit tight stay where you are and let this inner transformation take place and it is it's humbling I mean it's just really humbling to confront your faults and just to be to stay grounded just to stay grounded yeah and to be able to laugh at it all that's part of being humble yeah I just like to say thank you Chris uh for doing this work and bringing it back to us and uh your pioneering uh uh uh life is uh is a is is a beautiful um model thank you thank you Eaton it's it's been an honor it's been a true pleasure and I never imagined when I was doing this work you know all hidden and in that there would be this kind of audience and receptivity in my lifetime thank you Michael pollen you know who would have figured uh you know this such a shift in such a short period of time that we're able to have this conversation in so many living rooms across the country yeah yeah I just want to add my thanks as well GIS every time I've heard you it's been phenomenal and I'm I'm so grateful you're coming to the conference and I do want to say I find this book an absolute Paradigm shifter I think it's one of the most important books out there to read um so I hope everybody does read the book because uh you can't even I was thinking you could write 40 books based on the book that you wrote I any one of your chapters could be could be taken into three or four it's so dense but it's also so clear so beautifully written so I really really thank you thank you I appreciate that Lynn I tried to make it as clear as possible and it took me five years to really boil it down and to make it as transparent as possible because I wanted it to be available not just for people who worked with psychedelics but to be with people who did not take psychedelics and half of the letters I get are from people who have never taken psychedelics but they've had a spiritual practice and they know what I'm talking about because of their practice yeah than I have to leave and go play horn but thank you so much I saw your French horn it's it's a uh demanding mistress bye Tom Chris got a question that I I noticed that it's probably weeded out in all the condensation that you're condensing things that did during the writing process but you mentioned the the work you did I think um I don't know what like like there's a difference between trip and session I I don't know whe you could talk about why you use the word work because it sounds like you you show up and just who you are is what happens but could you talk a little bit more about what's the work of it yeah uh you know in the Japanese tradition U there is something that the Zen monks call A sashen A sashen is a period set aside for intense spiritual practice so it's like a a five day two week Meditation Retreat a sashen and uh a session to me is kind of an angelized version of sashen for me to do a psychedelic session is I'm I'm completely isolated from the world I've taken myself out of context with the world I'm not allowing anything into my mind except what's already there uh and I sit and I face what's there and I take it where it goes as far as I can take it and follow it and so it is work and now there many different psychedelics many different ways to work with Psy psychedelics I'm not trying to generalize in any way but for me working with high doses of psychedelics it it takes a tremendous commitment and willingness to let yourself be dismantled because it very quickly shatters the boundaries and you're in foreign territory very early on and year by year you're going deeper and deeper into foreign territory it takes time to acclimate when you break through to a new level of Consciousness you can't always remember everything that you experienced you I take notes I have gaps in the notes but go back and again and again and again to the same level of consciousness you learn how to acclimate you learn how to stay conscious in this level of Consciousness and what was previously uh a gapped narrative be you fill in the gaps you you get the whole story that's being taught you in my experience is we are taught consistently being tried something was trying to teach me certain things that bring me back over and over and over again till it was sure that I understood those things uh so it is work uh and I think processing the sessions uh is work I mean I developed a strategy for how to capture and how to capture these experiences so much so that I I you know there's a little line in the book which I say I think ineffability is overrated as a measure of mystical experience you know it's it's part of our test whether it's a genuine mystical experience whether it's inevitable and I understand that but I basically think that if you can't say where you've been you basically just got lost somewhere away and there's nothing wrong with getting lost but ineffability I understand it is it's hard but if you really work it hard you should be able to find words of being able to describe it remember that the Zen Masters don't have trouble talking about Enlightenment to other Zen Masters they can talk about it just fine they have trouble talking about it to people who have not had the experience that's when it becomes challenging right so we can find words for these things inevitably it's you know they're inadequate we can find words you know I don't know I just mentioned also to this condensation process I did a count not too long ago I have about 400 words 400 pages of notes for my sessions I the passages that I actually include in the book are less than 25% 34 of the content I did not include partly because they're repetitious and whatnot I I really try to to pick the most powerful passages but there was a lot left out Chris uh in one part I think about two-thirds way through the book you touched upon preparing ourselves to receive the Transmissions and I don't think you were talking about under the LSD I think you were talking about a normal existence am I right on that point and could you say something about preparing to receive them I assume it's being up to read the deeply subtle being open to that how subtle it is and what form it takes depends upon the form of practice we are doing in as we open to these realities so I anything I say really would pertain just to my individual situation not to the pattern as a whole um I think we know what transmission is about when we're talking about it with a spiritual teacher and you know in the Tibetan tradition they give a practice in three different levels the first level is they teach the mechanics of the practice the second level they teach the meaning of the practice but the third level the most important level is the transmission of lung the seed energy of the practice you receive a seed from the teacher who has already brought the practice to maturity in their own being and when they give this lung they're transmitting a a distilled essence of the practice that you then water and nourish in your practice so that's my con my con context we're thinking about transmission and I think that it's kind of is true for my psychedelic context and that is uh I was put through enormous purification processes in order to receive the teachings that came from these levels of consciousness uh and if I'm right that there is a certain parallel between what we do on our cushion and what takes place in a psychedelic session machine and what's happening historically then it supports the intuition that I have that um we are experiencing a shift in Divine influx so to speak there is a rise in energy coming up underneath us there is more information becoming available not only at the physical level through the internet and all this tremendous impact there but at at the center of our being being there are teachings and insights and understandings which are rising up inside of us which we can catch and but to catch them we have to prepare ourselves to receive them you know we must prepare ourselves and empty ourselves of everything which is small in order to catch pieces of that which is large coming to us and so I think transmission is a larger broader category yeah yeah you're you're reminding me that um that the when you get initiation in my tradition I I got to visualize it as like there's a kind of a silver tube that's kind of going into me and it's like there are certain things kind of flowing into me and then I end up basically just being like a small little reservoir of a thing out of which a certain amount can come and my Guru is a giant Reservoir you know of of a lake or whatever you know what I'm saying where I might be just this little bottle you know but but what's beautiful about what you're talking about also and then I would like to just point out the humility of saying that you don't think it maybe applies to everything else but the things that you're saying so closely resemble my own that um I I might want to disagree with you on that but I understand the humility of saying it like that so thank you okay yeah I was curious um I had a phone call with there's a gentleman Simon dwan I found an article of his in Scientific American Magazine he was writing about like oh he doesn't think they'll scientists will ever figure out if reality is a simulation or not but I I feel like from my perspective like I know it is and uh I'm curious like if the idea I don't know if you saw the movie The Matrix if you have any thoughts related to these kind of things well that that's a pretty popular in sci-fi isn't it the simulation and the complexity that we're living and quantum theory is telling us that everything we see in the visible world is underpinned by this in this larger subtle real Quantum reality now 95 96% of reality is dark energy and dark matter so that's telling us over and over again that what we're living is not the whole of what's what's real and to me uh physical reality is could be described as the skin on an Apple you know and it it's and the Apple grows the bigger the skin gets the universe is like that it gets bigger and bigger but when you con when you fall underneath the level of time space reality fall deeper into it you're falling deeper into the Apple toward the center of the apple and in the center of the Apple it for it's all light even physical reality is composed of light but at the center of the Apple there most radiant beautiful extreme extraordinary light Brilliance in so um I think this idea that there is a larger reality out there that structures and informs and receives this reality then after that then uh our psychology takes over and so do we see that reality as threatening do we see that reality as uh demanding or manipulative do we see it as a dark and and hostile reality or do we see it as a beautiful magnificent co-creating reality you know and my experience is that the the mother universe is extremely so so creative so intelligent so wise so loving and compassionate and of course you just looking at time and space if you want to see the wisdom of life or the little or the compassion of life you have to look very very deep because if you look on the surface it doesn't look wise and it doesn't look compassion and it doesn't look lovely it's a mean ass son of a but you have to step back and step back and step back and look deep in order to really see the wisdom that's built into this amazing laboratory that we're part of of growing the human experiment it's very fascinating yeah sure is isn't it yeah um Chris I'm not sure how to draw this up um I'll speak for myself some of the experiences I had in uh like the first time was I took nine months dropped out um just meditated several hours a day then about two years later I did it for six months and some of the experiences I had were so mind blowingly profound that in loving that I was I was just left sobbing sobbing and in Bliss doesn't isn't a word that really covers it it just experiences I've just never had never could imagine I would ever have yeah and they just left me words um yeah like just a a pull of sobbing wonderfulness yeah um just uh and I just know that you had a lot of those experiences it wasn't just all rational oh yeah that oh yeah this open up into that and no it's like some of these once they showed up in front of you it's like oh my God I mean just just no words for it no language no yeah it's like I think I think you know what getting words for this stuff it just yeah yeah it's like when the universe's heart touches your heart it just explodes it into the most magnificent dimensional Radiance that it just just there nothing to do except have a good Cry Of Joy it's just so joyful it's just so extraordinary and that's why you know the word that I give in the book for the universe in this way is my beloved because contact with it was so overwhelming it became a love affair I mean it really I talked about the rumpled sheets where we made love it's a love affair and it it's it it inspires such a hunger for it this eternal hunger that's in our being not only to reunite but to bring that reality to experience it wherever we are right now right here it's so deep uh it just it's a it's a heartache to be separated from it even for a day and to touch it is just Joy just joy in the body joy in the heart and mind and it's and it's more than a worldly Joy you know because we all humans you know we can experience joy in our daily lives or maybe not every day but you know what I mean yeah and these were experiences that were I'm a pretty articulate guy and that I I have such difficulty being able to put into words some of these experiences yeah other than just like the your knees collapse I wasn't stand at the time that these were happening but just like these knee buckling Soul buckling mind blow L mindblowing not even how to knowing how to be with it other than just you can't not be with it you can't be with it you're just there it's happening yeah um it's an overwhelm in terms of what the mind can make sense of and it's and it's wonderful in the highest sense Pure Clean clear yeah um and you can't capture it you cannot capture it you can't bring it back um at least for me I had to leave it there I didn't know how to bring it back yeah um and it's what gives me justification to want to keep evolving expanding yeah be it through your model or anybody's model that's about being an evolutional being of Consciousness um yeah there's such an in experiences that I can't ignore them in terms of my daily life anyhow yeah and no one could ever talk you out of them yeah I mean that's just it's like you go where I went then try to talk me out of exactly yes but isn't it interesting that at the moment of that type of joy we touch sadness too I know that experience yeah tell me about that to well I I know in therapy like when when somebody reaches a level of intimacy and they start crying it's this deep hunger and absence they've had for so long yeah and so in the midst of Joy there's actually sadness when you two were talking I could feel that Cosmic hunger to know the mind of God and when you get a glimpse of it I I think it's the same thing it's kind of good because there's a humbling a going on that moment and it's almost like it's saying to you you haven't seen anything yet yeah I know you said that in so many words a couple times this also reminds me of the book Quantum questions that Ken Wilbur wrote about how you know all the writings of the guys who did the work on quantum mechanics were all very sciency beforehand they were all very mystical afterward and it seems to me that what you did was actually examine Paradox at a kind of cosmological level whereas they were kind of looking at it uh in a I I think the expression that I use in the breakout room is you were looking at it through a telescope and they were looking at it through a microscope you know and so they like there's a you can see the infinite in either direction you know and I've had some mushroom trips where I've had like a Taurus like thing and I've got it was literally Ken Wilbur in the middle talking to me about what was going on on both ends of that thing do you know what I'm saying it it's like as the my my uh you know Avatar of Vishnu or whatever you know to to explain to me what was all going on so it's it's uh really interesting to see your book in light of having already read Quantum questions there's a lot of parallels there yeah it's interesting well folks it's approaching 9:30 on my time and I haven't seen my wife all day and she's just come back while we were doing a talk here

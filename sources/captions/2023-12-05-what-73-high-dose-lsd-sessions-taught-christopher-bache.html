      <p>[Music] welcome back to psychedelic therapy Frontiers the podcast devoted to exploring the frontiers of psychedelic medicine and what it takes to cultivate a healthy mind body and spirit as always psychedelic therapy Frontiers is brought to you by numinus I'm Dr Steve theer and today my co-host Dr Reed Robinson and I are joined by Dr Christopher bash PhD Chris is a professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngtown State University adjunct faculty at the California Institute for integral studies ameritus fellow at The Institute of noetic Sciences and on the advisory Council of grath Legacy training he's the author of several books but the one that prompted us to reach out to him for this interview is LSD in the mind of the universe an account of what Chris experienced and learned from 73 high do LSD Journeys that he embarked on over the course of 20 years in today's conversation we explore Chris's LSD session protocol the difference between using psychedelics for what he calls cosmological exploration versus spiritual enlightenment or even psychological healing talk about how Chris processed and integrated his very intense experiences what he learned about reincarnation Evolution at the collective and individual levels what humans need to do to survive the mounting existential threats we face what he means by Diamond luminosity and Diamond soul and of course much much more Chris's book had a profound impact on me his disciplined scholarly approach to psychedelic exploration combined with his ability to articulate and teach what for most of us would be an overwhelming or ineffable experience has resulted in a must-read in my opinion for anyone who thinks deeply about questions like who are we what are we doing here and where we might go from here if you've ever listened to an episode of psychedelic therapy Frontiers and thought to yourself you know I wonder where I could find good training on how to use psychedelics in a clinical practice well Wonder no longer numinus has several excellent psychedelic therapy training programs click on the link in the show notes or go directly to nus.edu.sg nus.edu.sg Chris thank you so much for joining us it's a pleasure to be here with you today so why don't we just start Chris by um introducing yourself to our audience and you can you know share as much or as little as you'd like just to give us some context well I'm a Prof retired professor of religious studies I made my living uh teaching in the department of philosophy and religious studies in Youngstown State University which is a State University in Northeast Ohio so my what brings me to this program I guess is the book that I published 3 years ago called LSD in the mind of the universe which is a strange book for a professor of religious studies to have written so my story is that right at the very beginning of my uh academic career 1978 I just finished my graduate work at Brown in philosophy of religion and I met the work of Stan gra and I immediately L recognized that his research and LS psychedelics in general were extraordinarily important not just for Clinical Psychology uh and for therapy but for philosophy which was what interested me the most and so uh I began um even though it was illegal I began a quiet private uh psychedelic uh practice which ended up continuing for 20 years I worked for four years years I then uh stopped for six years for reasons I describe in the book and then I worked for another 10 years and then I spent another 10 years digest this is from 79 to 99 when I was 50 to 30 to 50 and then I spent the next 20 years digesting those experiences trying to absorb them trying to extrapolate and clarify the cosmological implications of those experiences and that's and then I published uh LSD in the mind of the universe so that's kind of a brief sketch of what brings me here yeah it's and it's and I remember as I was reading your book I was thinking what a heroic undertaking I don't know if heroic is a word that lands for you Chris but I mean heroic in the sense of a hero's journey um the things you describ in the book the experiences that you had not for the faint of heart and I've heard you say that um you necessarily recommend the protocol uh the things that you did to others and I was curious as to why well first let me describe the protocol first everything I did was within a strict therapeutic protocol I followed St protocols from his book LSD cych therapy so traditional is lying down uh eye shades uh earphones listening to very carefully uh choreographed uh music to guide the session I was always always in private always protected always with a sitter uh who was my wife at the time who was a clinical psychologist uh so established in what I call the Psychedelic Kea and a Kea of spiritual practice um for reasons that we can go into but we don't need to I chose to work with very high doses of LSD after about three sessions at two 50 microgram I chose to work at 500 to 600 micrograms which is the upper limit it's it's the body saturation point and naively uh I was thinking at the time that this work was about personal transformation even personal Spiritual Awakening and all the spiritual literature described one's Karma ultimately as finite even though it may involve you know causation patterns from multiple incarnations But ultimately it's finite so I thought of this therapeutic work as a process of clearing the conditioning of my of my psyche and essentially engaging in clarifying and purifying Karma and I thought if I worked with large doses of LSD I could basically go through this faster if I could manage the intensity of the work essentially taking bigger bites of karma in every session well I found out down the road that all those assumptions I was making were wrong it this work was not about personal transformation not working at this High a dose level if you're working with a gentle or psychedelic or in lower doses then the activation and the purification and the healing that would take place might be constricted or to personal levels but if you're working with a a very powerful psychedelic like this much LSD uh you basically amplify Consciousness so deeply that what may have begun as a personal transformative process becomes engaged in Collective processes that having to do with the collective unconscious the species mind and from there you're Off to the Races into deeper and deeper levels of consciousness cycles of death and rebirth not just ego death and ego death is the first many deaths that you face on this journey but as you go through one level of Consciousness after another systematically um you go through many uh forms of death that are more foreign perhaps than ego death uh so that's that's why I I don't recommend the protocol uh because it's an extremely demanding protocol uh it it takes a lot of it it basically becomes the center focus of much of your life just to engage these deep states to navigate them to absorb them and integrate them into your life and integrate them into your your social life and into your body if and I also I thought that there was an end point to this journey you know one of my false assumptions was the reason for doing this work was to get somewhere you to get to Enlightenment or to become one with God or to enter into the Primal void of existence and I had all of those experiences and I discovered that there were many levels of divinity that one can enter into communion with and there were even many levels of the of the pure void of the Fertile void and about oh 15 years into my experience I had a particular experience when I was as deep into the universe as I would ever go deep into what I call the diamond Luminosity domain and I had an experience that I saw reality far far into the distance which and the beam of light hit me from that reality and it shattered me uh it it just shattered me and I was in a very high and subtle State of Consciousness and that's when I realized uh it's an infinite Journey you'll never get to the end of the universe the universe is just too vast the depth of the Divinity is just so great so now that if I were to start this journey over again I would be much gentler with myself I'd work with gentle i' balance low dose high dose organic psych psychedelics synthetic psychedelics because now I understand that the real goal of this work is to open yourself to let in as much of the love and intelligence and wisdom of the universe as you can into your system and then to digest it and hold on to it and and draw it into your life and let it guide you and it's not about getting um to some Final Destination that's uh beautiful Chris thank you for for sharing I'm so many questions come up but one thing um I wanted to ask along those lines is um what do you think the risks are of going straight to those higher um deep States uh like going to the higher Doses and perhaps bypassing some of the the healing work or the lower dose work is there a little more you can share on um how you might use those two different uh dose ranges as tools yeah well first of all any work with psychedelics especially if you're working with higher doses uh in a therapeutic protocol any work with psychedelics uh can be challenging and therefore calls for good psychological screening uh to make sure that you have a psyche that's ready to engage these deep levels uh as you know there are some people who should never go near psyched psychedelics and there are some people who should really work very gently uh with psychedelics if they work with psychedelics at all I happen to have a constitution that uh can become large or can flow into expansive States pretty readily and congeal pretty readily and smoothly at the end of the day not everybody is wired like that and so it's you know all the cautions have to be taken all the clinical you know criteria have to be met for this type of work now if you work with high doses is you can bypass I mean you can get into situations where you can chase a particular level of experience and bypass but that wasn't that didn't happen to me it wasn't part of my work uh I spent the first 10 sessions in two and a half years in very grueling kind of work with in what Stan calls the parin level level of Consciousness the interface between your personal unconscious and um the collective or transpal personal Consciousness so it's you know you're you're reliving your birth you're dealing with all sorts of existential crisis you're really grinding things very deeply at that level now I I will say that late in my sessions rather late I mean 15 years down the road I mean there was lots of personal healing that took place along the way don't don't get me wrong there were personal healings that took place in those first 10 sessions and other down the road often they would take place at the beginning and ending of my sessions if I when I was leaving SpaceTime and when I was coming back into SpaceTime because when I was working in the peak of the sessions after about you know the first two or three years of work I was working in States Of Consciousness that were far beyond my personal Consciousness and far beyond SpaceTime even but along the way you know packaged around the areas there was lots of healing of different parts um and late in the sessions there was some very quick uh healings of pieces of my life and I think if I had been working with lower doses those healings would have taken place earlier but I found that in my particular instance I don't think it was because I was was jumping over any problems or I was not willing to confront any problems because the things you confront at the Deep levels of the psyche are much much more severe than anything that you confront at the personal level of the psyche and I want to say that you know I came into this work I wasn't carrying any personal trauma I had a a pretty easy start in life I had good parents good good home environment nothing more than the ordinary Push Pull uh in a family and so there wasn't a deep wound that I took into this work other than the deeper wound is really the wounds that everybody every human being carries when they enter time and space that is the wound of stabilizing within time and space and understanding why we are here what is the whole purpose my existence uh in this domain and uh can I can I discover what my reason for being here is and can I enter into communion with the intelligence that I believe saturates all existence so in my particular case what I found was that um and I have to say this carefully for someone who doesn't know my work it may sound grandiose and I apologize for that but I found that my personal wounds were not kind of healed until late in my work because it was my personal wounds that anchored me in the larger feels of Consciousness in such a way that it allowed me to accomplish or to be used to accomplish some of the healing of the collective psyche that took place in my work that is I it's like the way I describe it in the book my personal wound anchored one side of a bridge and the other side of the bridge was the collective psyche and by having that bridge when I went deep into awareness Consciousness it allowed my sessions to become a conduit to pull some of the pain of the collective psyche out of the collective psyche and to transform it and if my personal wounds had been healed early on U that ability to do that would have been compromised and what I learned along the way is that this function this specific function to engage the collective psyche in a way to bring a certain measure of healing to it was part of my soul's work it was something that I kind of signed up for in this Incarnation and I think personally I think there are a lot of people who are doing this type of work and have signed up for this type of work I don't think there's anything special or unusual about my choice to do this work it is uh uh from our perspective a very brave hero's journey as as Steve mentioned earlier when we were chatting but but I'm also curious about that disposition you mentioned um because it uh comes into play in um people we work with and a lot of questions we get how much of it do you think is uh nature versus nurture how much can you cultivate as an ability to expand uh and hold those states without you know shattering into overwhelm or um getting discombobulated um wondering if you have some thoughts on that I'm I'm sure you I mean I I know we can learn how to enter these states more skillfully uh some people have a natural aptitude for moving into them but whatever the level of aptitude is uh we practice in these states and we enter into them carefully and if you enter carefully and process carefully and debrief carefully we can learn how to enter these states better in future in future sessions I really think uh integration and very careful debrief careful recording of your session after it's over processing it really sitting with the content of it is really important because it establishes the Baseline for your next entry into your non-ordinary state and so it's like a cycle and integrating your work as you go go is really important to the next step in your work now I I want to mention that in my work um particularly since it was being a it was being driven by such highly ampli ified States Of Consciousness in my work I kept as many variables stable as possible so for all these sessions I worked in the same set in setting same substance same dose same sitter uh same recording process even the same part of the country because any of these variables can change some of the texture and and that's not bad to change the texture but by standardizing the variables I think itat created a container which allowed my conversation with the universe and my communion with the universe to progressively deepen deep get deeper and deeper over time so by stabilizing the content the contact zone of contact that I made with the universe it allowed the deepening to take place now of course what kind of communication or contact we have with you Universe partly depends upon the Headroom of the Psychedelic that we're using and all psychedelics uh you know psilocybe and ioan um MDMA 5meodmt LSD they all have certain qualities of how they engage Consciousness and they have a certain Spectrum a range of of engaging and I think one of the reasons I kept breaking through over 20 years one level of Consciousness after another had to do with holding the posture uh holding the setting but also with the sheer power of the Psychedelic that I was using if I had been working with a psilocybin I'm sure my experiences would have overlapped a great deal but I don't think it would have had as much head cosmological Headroom uh as working with LSD did and how did your uh your wife then feel about about the trip sitting Duty that's uh kudos to her on the dedication for that role as well was it hard to hard to uh convince her to do that or was she kind of with you in this purpose of the the philosophical Adventure Carol did this out of love for me uh she was never particularly drawn to working with psychedelics um they were too much too fast and her opinion she's a a deeply spiritual person and uh we eventually after 24 years of marriage we separated and she has G we're friends and we stay in contact with each other and with our children particularly around our children she has gone on to complete her three-year three Monon Retreat uh in the vadana tradition so she's a serious practitioner and she has a a deep spiritual Orient ation it's been it's lifelong and it was a tremendous value to me to have her spiritual wisdom grounding me while I entered into this work but it was never her work and she did it because she knew I wanted to do it and we always supported each other uh in our spiritual paths that's really neat now thanks for sharing all this yeah Chris I'm I'm really captivated by the the very scientific like approach that you took or at least a very careful and deliberate and disciplined approach and the way I imagine it is by controlling for those variables you were able to return to maybe the same drill site and just sort of augur down and get this very very deep core sample of the cosmos you know very very deep core sample of the universe and you know as it manifested in you and you manifested in it as opposed to what some Psychonauts or people who are approaching psychedelics for therapeutic or spiritual exploration purposes do where they just sort of Pock Mark the Surface by not paying close attention to set and setting or they're experimenting with many different types of of substances yeah yeah I think that's I think that's true there of course there's no right or wrong way to use psychedelics there are so many ways of using them and um many good ways of using them so I just happen to represent one particular strategy I was train as a philosopher of religion I have a natural orientation towards precision and Analysis and so particularly since I wasn't didn't fully know what I was getting into I wanted to leave breadcrumbs in case I needed to work my way back out again uh it turns out that was a that was not a a needed concern um I'm sorry I'm losing my train of thought here a little bit well no I I have a I guess I have a follow-up question here Chris because as a trained philosopher of religion I I think I've read um if not in the book it might have been in the postcript uh that you wrote for Paradigm explorer that um you know you when you started approaching this work you might have described yourself as an agnostic sort of atheist leaning agnostic um and I'm curious to hear how your belief in or relationship to the Divine changed if at all as a result of your uh experience with this substance and this protocol well you know basically through all The Graduate Studies and I went through uh I basically studied my way out of religion entirely and out of theism and out of any belief in the Divinity as I had learned it by studying world religions and the history of Theology and philosophy and so I began this work as as not just an agnostic but an atheistically inclined agnostic was like okay you're going to put up or shut up on this one because right now it's it it doesn't look good I mean my the whole I think science has just gone through and wiped out anything any that smacks of traditional religion because the god of the religions of the axial age that deity is just too small for the universe that science is showing us is is here the massive scale and scope and intelligence of it and the you know it's just I think it just erased the Blackboard and we're still catching up with this erased Blackboard so I brought a mind that was not adverse to religion but was adverse to theology in a way and but when you begin to have experiences of the reality that the religions have been talking about well that changes everything very quickly uh so that when one goes does this work and you go through cycles of death and rebirth and you go through this process of of losing your reality or or surrendering your reality as you have known it inside time and space and you go through a death of that reality and a rebirth you wake up in another level of reality another dimension of existence and you do that again again and again in a systematic way then the reality of uh the reality of a reality beyond space and time just becomes overwhelmingly clear and true to you and your ability to understand it and to uh absorb it and to taste it uh becomes second nature now in all the years I did this work and all the levels of consciousness I went through I never encountered anything that might be recognized as a deity or even a personal spiritual guide which is pretty common in many shamanic Traditions but I always felt myself to be engaging an intelligence that was essentially guiding my experiences or or kind of feeding these exper experiences to me in an interactive participatory Manner and this this Consciousness boundaries of this Consciousness kept deepening the deeper my practice went um in that context I could speak about God but I don't really like to because God has so many connotations in the west that I'm not comfortable with and you I could speak about Divine divinity but that's just kind of smuggling in you know through a side door so I tend to speak about the creative intelligence of the Universe um because in one way a way of understanding the scale and scope of what I actually experienced is to understand that the Universe has a mind the and actually the universe arises out of a mind it arises out of a Consciousness and it's always sustained and nurt nurtured by a more fundamental reality which you can call it spiritual uh you can call it dark energy dark matter you know but now we know that 96% of the universe is invisible Dark Energy Dark Matter so it's not that radical to sort of suggest that there is a reality behind physical reality um I think all our historical concepts of of God have been profoundly incomplete in inadequate and we are entering a period of History where we're basically going to be rewriting that story and I think psychedelics have an important role to play because it lets ordinary Mortals in a way it just ordinary late people have firstand contact with this vast expanse of spiritual reality that gives you experiences that you know are the kind of experiences that previously in in earlier Generations people would have described as the experience of God so Chris who who are we in this story you know are we as others have stated are we sort of this this you know unique organization of of molecules that is the universe experiencing itself this each one of us a fractal you know know that where the universe gets to Joy in experiencing itself in a way that wouldn't have otherwise like what what do you think we are I think you say it pretty well uh I think you know this that question has so many levels to it and it depends on how we want to frame it going in uh we are clearly part of the creative uh experiment that the universe is we are we are an aspect of it we're not separated from it we are our nature our body the cells of our biology arise out of this evolutionary Masterpiece um and our mind just as our body derives from the universe our mind derives from the universe now I know in our period of History we're we're taught that the universe is a machine and it it moves with the machine's blindness and it's evolves through random mutation and genetic mutation and random variation and screening by a necessity but that's just a story that we've told and it's not been a bad story but it's a profoundly incomplete story because when you when you sink down into the depth of your mind you drop eventually out of your mind into deeper layers of Mind into the species mind into the you know a solar system or Galactic mind and as you drop down into that you engage you you find yourself confronting or being dissolved into an intelligence that is just stunningly vast I mean it's just a massive intelligence and a depth of love and compassion that's behind that intelligence and and it's this intelligence which is manifesting the universe that we experience it's manifesting itself as the universe and we are fortunate enough to be cells within this body of divine self- manifestation fractally embedded in it so that our story is part of its story its story is part of our story now that's at what one level and then at a deeper level if we add reincarnation into it and of course that's an assumed in my worldview not because of Faith but because of the empirical evidence that we have amassed at this point in time my first book was on reincarnation and I think that's just part of how nature functions we don't really know how it came to function this way but nature has found a way to fold learning forward not only at the species level in an EV in a broad species evolutionary sense but it's found a way to fold individual learning forward in a way that I think reincarnation is simply the higher Octave of evolution and once we add evolu reincarnation into the story once we understand that we are participants in this evolving Universe for not just a hundred years but for 100,000 years then the plot really thickens then we're looking at the universe is in intensely involved in manifesting galaxies solar systems planets life self-aware life and then evolving reincarnating life that puts us on some type of profound co- footing with Creation with existence so that we really are our Evolution and its Evolution are really part of the same fabric human evolution individ idual Evolution they're really two different aspects of the same process so if you'll permit me Chris to just keep pulling on this thread because it's one that's fascinated me and preoccupied me frankly for my entire life I mean um this notion of who we are in relation to the universe what is the what is Divinity um because when you when we're preoccupied with the m what feels like the mundan you know mundane of daily life paying our taxes going to work that kind of thing um and we think of ourselves as this as I said for sort of this fractal uh piece of what you describe as this practically infinite intelligence the substrate of which it sounds like is love um it it it causes me to think like well so are we have we always existed in some way shape or form as an individualized intelligence related to this this grander one because when you talk about reincarnation it makes me wonder like was there is there some continuity to Steve faer that goes back hundreds and hundreds of thousands of years that I just don't remember right or is it each time we're we're deconstructed to our constituent parts and reassembled with new parts and and it's just sort of pieces that move forward in time what what do you think yeah well you know we don't know the answers to all the all the answers to those questions uh we don't really know how reincarnation works we don't know what the physics of reincarnation is even if we have evidence evidence that reincarnation is a fact of nature we don't know the nature of it how it goes how it works but it seems to be that the universe is a learning system and reincarnation is a part of a learning system so because our Consciousness did not begin with our body uh but our Consciousness goes back farther we can use a concept like Soul some type of concept that holds and gathers the learning from all of the incarnations that we've experienced how far back does it go two questions how far back does it go all right and the answer is nobody knows for sure but all the cultures that have believed in reincarnation say it doesn't start with human beings it starts before human beings how far before human beings well we're not really sure now my sense is that it's it starts when individuality begins to emerge within the evolutionary Matrix and I'll use the term evolution frequently as you know as you've heard but that and I believe in the concept of progressive development a progressive unfolding but that doesn't mean I agree with the kind of standard textbook theory of what's driving reincarnation so when I use the term EV Evolution I don't mean that theory uh that reductive determinist Theory H it's about learning how far back does it go somewhere along the way between grasses and chimpanzees it's hard to think of individual Blades of grass having individual Consciousness we usually think in terms of broad classes but somewhere in the evolutionary process an individuality emerges and as that individuality emerges there's a learning that deepens that individuality over time and that's when I think reincarnation becomes possible classically they look to animals that are uh well lowered down the mamalian change but somewhere around in somewhere in the animal life form but wherever it emerges the next question question is what are we underneath these evolving changes and I think the answer to that is you have to get that takes us down into a deeper level underneath the soul and we ask well what is the essence of the Soul what is the essence of our individuality what's the essence that makes this evolving individuality possible and there I think we we find the same answers in psychedelic work that we find in the classic mystical Traditions classic High spiritual traditions and that is the essence of the individual is the essence of the Divine the essence of the one is the essence of the totality we are in essence derived from the Divine Sparks of the Divine we've been sort of teased out of the unitive Matrix of the Divinity and been given the privilege of individuated existence which then is polished and refined and deepen over thousands and thousands and thousands of years of going back and forth between spirit and matter spirit and matter spirit and matter taking us onto a developmental process but the essence of what we are is the Divine itself the manifestation of what we are depends upon how long we've been cooking that's uh fascinating and how you mentioned Karma earlier uh how you viewed it going into this work and suggested that maybe it changed but wondering how you view Karma now in this uh in this broad perspective that you've been sharing it's simply as cause and effect you know it's karma vaka cause and effect uh it simply make in it course the universe pulses with cause and effect right at all of its levels but here we're simply talking about a substrate of cause and effect the causes that are set in motion by the exercise of our capacity to choose we make choices we inherit the consequences of those choices in that new context we make new choices and then we inherit the consequences of those choices so if we've been smoking uh two packs of cigarettes every day for five years we're not free to not want that next cigarette but we are free to begin to set in motion a series of choices that can free us from that addiction to those cigarettes so we're constantly making choices we inherit the consequences of those choices one of the ways in which my thinking has changed over the years since writing life cycles my first book Is that I have a much deeper appreciation of the uh synergistic relationship between individual development or indiv idual Karma and Collective development or Collective Karma I think that we have a tendency in the west to over personalize the concept of Karma to really kind of tell the story of the individual soul maturing over many lifetimes and reaching Enlightenment or whatever and I think these our species is evolving pulsing every hundred years right in reincar ation and there is a a collective learning process taking place which our individual learning processes part of and so the boundary between collective learning and individual learning uh is pores and I have much more respect or sensitivity to the collective Karma that I had might have previously seen as personal Karma yeah wow and um earlier you mentioned the role psychedelics might be playing in this kind of evolution of Consciousness these days and when we were talking about that place between Blades of grass and chimpanzees I'm wondering what your thoughts are on Terrence McKenna's like Stone ape hypothesis and if that was an example of the universe uh um between spirit and matter learning as it evolved and uh if you viewed psychedelics as PL a role in history as well terrence's hypothesis there is interesting isn't it yeah uh and I don't have I don't have an opinion on that I I don't have uh any particular any new insights to add to that I hold it as an interesting hypothesis um I don't have any individ any independent way of assessing that um so I just don't know now I do think that we are coming to a turning point in history we are coming to a make or break point in history um and I think that uh psychedelics have a significant role to play uh and they're giving us extra awareness at a time when we desperately need extra awareness they also are giving us a form of accelerated and deepening healing at a time when we desperately need acceler ated and deepening healing because I think that there is a tremendous interner fermentation process taking place a tremendous detoxification taking place at the collective level as well as an individual level and it ex it manifests itself in our individual lives in terms of this kind of more uprush of content of karmic content of conditioning of pain and Trauma that we been carrying ing in our soul history uh but I think this is happening not just to a few select individuals who are middle class able to attend to this but it's happening underneath us in our social movements and underneath the World At Large and I think psychedelics by giving us an amplified experience of our Consciousness and our Consciousness and the Consciousness that we are part of it not only helps us heal and helps us manage AG this purification process but it also gives us a wider worldview which it only takes you know a one good deep psychedelic experience of communion with the Deep structure of the universe to shatter materialism the philosophy of that matter is the only thing that's real um I think Houston Smith was right that a mystical experience does not a Mystic make but a Mystic experience can an atheist unmake you know and I think psychedelics have a very important role to play in that now how far can will this go how deep will psychedelic healing reach in our culture how fast would these insights realized under psychedelic communion change or contribute to the paradigm shift that's taking place which is being driven by multiple discip right now I don't know uh but it seems that you know the fact that LSD was invented at the same decade that the nuclear bomb was invented and the nuclear bomb has changed the order of of Global Order uh I think is may be sign significant synchronicity So speaking of this time in human development and as somebody who has really dedicated his academic and personal life to exploring what it means to be human I'm curious to know if you have an opinion on artificial intelligence you know some some folks who uh talk about the the way psychedelics are helping us learn who we are um might be really really important given that we might be creating something that is different but also conscious I'm curious to know if you have an opinion you know I don't really have an opinion uh people I it has not come up in any of my sessions I you know finished my sessions in 1999 artificial intelligence never came up in my sessions uh I stand on the sidelines as a lay person and kind of an old lay person I'm 74 years old and and this is really a younger generation's work and I watch what's happening in artificial intelligence work just from the edges and I can see that it's developing much faster than I could possibly keep track of personally I'm concerned about about it but clearly it's here it's happening now it's it's going to have huge impact on us in the future I don't know what what role it will play whether it will be a a friend or an enemy uh over time I'm more concerned about the ecological Cliff that we're going over because this is very we can extrapolate and we are getting a clear and clearer vision of how the imbalances that we have generated in the industrial era are beginning to manifest with catastrophic consequences and the cumulative effect of U these ecological crises which are going to keep hitting again and again until we get on top of this and we're not anywhere near to beginning to get on top of it uh this is turning the 21st century I think into uh a tremendous A Century of tremendous Global in stability and Global unraveling and crisis so that to me has been kind of focal point in my thinking how artificial intelligence plays into this I don't know and on the E ecological front uh how much of that uh realization of uh the problems that we Face how much of that came from these psychedelic deep Dives and and or how much of it is just from kind of your experience in life and did you get any insights any any ways you think psychedelics or the expansion of awareness or raising Consciousness uh might help us in our uh in a better path forward well let's hold the second part of that question of how psychedelics might help us in a better path forward and let me address the first part of it um because this was one of the biggest surprises of my of my work I mean first I had to let go of the framing of my work as personal Journey personal transformation personal healing personal Awakening Spiritual Awakening get involved in a much larger dance with the uh species mind with the collective unconscious being catapulted from there into levels of archetype of reality and then being catapulted into deeper causal levels of reality and so so I say this just to mark that I understand that what I'm about to say about human where we are and where we're going historically will sound outrageous and they will sound highly speculative but when you my experience is very simply when you work very very deeply way under far underneath the personal psyche dropping into uh the collective psyche and into to the creative intent underlying uh Evolution the evolution of our species these things come naturally into Focus uh in a way which make perfect sense from a Quantum Paradigm or a post neonian atomistic materialist Paradigm so there's a chapter in LSD in the mind of the future and the universe which I is the birth of the future human and it's a chapter where I gathered together all the experiences that took place in my journey that bear on this question where is Humanity now and where are we going and it was one of the complete surprises to me that this came up in my sessions and this was a long this is a long time ago before I had any ecological awareness you know before I'd absorb the information that we're all absorbing today these Visions took place between 1991 and 1995 so you know a long time ago I was completely naive about uh hitting our environmental limits hitting our ecological Limits The Crisis that was building in our culture what began to happen is tucked in around the edges here and there I began to be given visions of where Humanity was in its evolutionary Saga I began to be given visions that we were coming to a turning point a definitive turning point in human history an evolutionary pivot I began to be given visions that we are entering a magnificent period of human history where there was just tremendous blessings coming to us a period of profound transformation that the future of humanity would be radically unlike its present and its past and there was some fundamental process that we were undergoing that was taking us there but for the first three or four years of this I was given these consistent visions of a of a future but was given no indication of how we would actually get there how was nature going to pull off because you look around us it does doesn't look very positive guys I mean you know more people are at the shopping mall uh than they are in transformative weekend uh workshops uh violence is escalating how how are we going to make this transition and then in 1995 in December of 95 when I was very far along in my psychedelic work I had entered a stage of work that I called the diamond luminosity material so I was halfway through years of work in this very subtle exquisitly Sublime Diamond Luminosity work and in the middle of that in a rhythm when I was expecting to be taken back into the diamond Luminosity instead I was dissolved into the species mind so and in that context as the species I went through a process say or I experien a death and Rebirth of the Human family I experien a profound unraveling of Life as we had known it a profound challenging it's hard to describe this because most of our experiences we experience from within a self-referential point and and it it sounds ludicrous to just say I described the death of humanity as Humanity but I experienced this tremendous building crisis in the world and the unraveling of people's lives and the shattering of expectations and the shattering of systems until eventually Humanity was reduced to the bare challenge of survival just bare survival it was so deep it looked for a while like it was going to be an Extinction event it was a Global Systems crisis which appeared to be driven by a cascading series of ecoc crises I wasn't given any details beyond that I wasn't given any timetable I wasn't given any sense of the how this would happen I was just taken into this deep cultural Collective crisis and then just when it was at its worst we seemed to move through this crisis and when we began to pick ourselves up on the other side of this crisis we had been changed by this crisis we had been changed radically they had taken place an opening of the human heart an opening of compassion a profound change in human we would say classically in human nature I would describe it as a shift in the fundamental structure of the collective unconscious what we're looking at is what you might think of it as a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche when we moved through this crisis as we began to reassemble ourselves the entire world was saturated with new values new perceptions of the good new social institutions this was a huge transformation of the human heart and then I was given many instructions on the mechanisms how we would make through this make it through this crisis faster than we would think possible give given this pace at which history moves and it has to do with understanding the function of the collective psyche as a field the the you know this is going on maybe a little long but the synopsis is that the collective psyche is a unified field and this crisis will be so severe it will shove not only individual psyches into a non-equilibrium into an highly altered state but it'll shove the collective psyche of humanity into a non-equilibrium or far from equilibrium condition we have a certain knowledge about how physical systems when they are shoved into a non-equilibrium state behave we've learned this from Chaos Theory a number of different areas there is a sense in which I was shown that the human psyche when shoved into a similar non-equilibrium state will exhibit some of the same characteristics the capacity for Rapid change the emergence of new structures emerging from the floor of the collective psyche that small iterations small changes can produce dramatic outcomes the N the bottom line of this is that we were going to be moving through this crisis much faster than we would think possible because of the severity and the negative impact this crisis was going to be having on lives all around the world subsequent sessions in the Years following I was given the experience moving into deep time again and moving beyond linear time experiencing what I call the future human experiencing the archetypal form of humanity and I experienced this being this being is an extraordinarily beautiful being just a magnificent being this being is in some ways as far beyond us as we are beyond our earlier Homo erectus uh cousins uh a being with a massive heart a healed heart an open mind and not just a a transformation of our heart and a transformation of our mind that opens up all sorts of possibilities but actually a transformation of our sensory experience we tend to have a mechanical understanding of our theory about how senses work but I was shown I was given the experience that the more Consciousness is Consolidated in our body the more refined our exper our sensory experiences can become and so I had an experience at the very end of my journey of my vision aund times sharper than it is an ordinary Consciousness and so the same applies to our hearing and all our other senses so this is a pivot of a radically transformed human species of a radically opened heart radically open mind and a radically augmented a physical capacity right so I think this is the story of our Century this is the story of the century that we're all dealing with is how do we make this transition how do we make this pivot from our present condition into uh our next evolutionary form and this is what I call the birth of the diamond soul but I'll stop here and give you a chance to ask any questions well one followup question on that last note but I definitely want to get into the birth of the the Diamond soul but um do any of as a professor of religious studies and um I'm just wondering if any of the the ways um certain religions or philosophies view this um line up with what you're describing I'm thinking in particular of say the Kali Yuga uh from Hinduism and you know thousands of years ago the beginning of this Dark Age and materialism and Corruption and the the ancient sages or rishes kind of retreat into the the Himalayas or wherever but haven't disappeared entirely and then kind of that the turn of this age into the golden age or SATA Yuga you have the return of wisdom intelligence compassion uh and I'm wondering if if any of those um line up or if you apply any Frameworks to help understand this from from your other studies in addition to the ones you mentioned we have a number of Hopey prophecy of course uh there are a number of indigenous cultures uh that have been seeing this profound transformation had been talking about it for a long long time uh and it's it's interesting and and it does line up uh I think the general perception is that we are we are in a period of Darkness but I I would conceptualize that Darkness as a period in which the condition conditioning of the past which is you know kind of the karmic patterns which shape the human psyche at Deep structural levels we are entering a period of infusion of Grace and infusion of energy which is driving driving this past to the surface of our psyche so we can deal with it all the hatreds of History the divisions which we've carved in the human psyche which we've carved on the planet the the divisions of race the divisions of gender the divisions of nationality the divisions of halves and Have Nots this all the patterns of splitting the world between in these categories are being driven to the surface and there're all these toxicities are coming out of us and have to come out of us in order to make make us available to the influx of the Divine energy which is entering and you can think of it as entering us from above or coming up within us underneath but I think there there's something deeply true about these ancient prophecies that we we are in a sense in the age of the kuga and uh we are coming into a profound new age when it will hit us when we're how we will get there I don't know uh but I think there's a relation between these prophecies it is something that feels as I hear you talk about it Chris it's something that does feel very true when I as a psychologist you know I've been very curious about the human psyche and kind of like the questions I asked earlier about who we are have always uh been on my mind because when I look at the human organism I see a being that is capable of so much more than we currently tend to produce that is a capable of great violence that is C capable of fear and and terrible behaviors that are based on fear but also capable of great creativity and adaptation and love and inclusion and compassion were such a paradox and I and as terrifying as it sounds the things that you described this sort of maturity process this next next stage of development it does sound necessary that we would need some kind of Crisis to I don't know if the right word is force or Draw out this next stage of our development um and I look at at my own psychedelic experiences and those of my clients and others that I've read about as almost an exercise in existential crisis right it's almost like going through a Refiner's Fire to to kind of uh burn away the dross so that the purity of what you really are can come forward but I but back to our conversation about integration I think because of how intense that can be and how confusing it can be it can be really hard to make use of in sort of our imminent life right day-to-day life yeah it can it really can um what happens I think is that once we get into this work deeply we suddenly realize we're playing on a different playing field than we had thought we were playing on before uh and it's a lot it's a much bigger game that's a foot and and it's not about our own personal life and personal transformation but we are involved in historic processes of enormous import and so if you're going to engage the Deep psyche you're kind of going into the deep end of the pool you're you're going into the deep deep water and the deep water is moving very fast right now and there's a tremendous kind of bubbling taking place and everybody has a a certain tolerance for being able to handle the complexity and the intensity of what's taking place at that very deep level so when we come back we we need to not only record as carefully as we can what is the nature of our vision AR experience but then we really have to take care of ourselves as we try to integrate those experiences I'll tell you that it took me a year to recover from that exper that session I told you about uh the birth of the future human that collapse the death and Rebirth of humanity it took me about a year to really recover from that and to sort of stabilize that and even then I mean for for the years that I've held that Vision you really have to practice the Arts of grounding if you're going to go deep you better be well grounded uh in all levels physically emotionally psychologically and socially uh with your peer groups because it's a demanding process that we're involved in now my sense is before my understanding of how reincarnation works is we get to choose the life that we incarnate in we we are given a certain set of options of of and we sort of see what we're going into if we choose the lives that we're going into and that means I think that every person here on this planet has chosen to be here in the form that they are and that means that all of us have chosen to Incarnate at this very demanding time in history history we want to be a player in this demanding time in history from a spiritual perspective well let me I'm I'm back up and be careful on this I don't want to go too far too fast but I think we all knew what we were getting into when we incarnated and we chose to be part of this process for our benefit for the benefit of our children and our grandchildren all around the world and for the de for the benefit of the Divine itself because uh the Divine is working I mean this is not something humanity is doing this is something nature is doing and whatever the intelligence is that lies behind and within nature that it's doing you know i' this has always been a question I've had about this notion of choosing to Incarnate and if if you'd rather not go down this path we don't have to Chris but um you know the idea that uh somebody would choose to Incarnate um as as a baby born with fetal alcohol syndrome or somebody would choose to Incarnate as a kid who was born the last year uh in some War torn country or or a place where there was a lot of disease and conflict um yeah again if you'd rather not try to tackle that it's okay I know there are some things we just don't have answers to but how does how does a a reincarnation perspective grapple with those realities yeah yeah and just terrible terrible suffering babies born without brain without neocortex and enolic children babies are born into violent circumstances destined to die after a very short life life with terrible pain how can we possibly comp assert that there is intelligence let alone compassion behind in such a universe and I think in order to see the wisd and to see the intelligence we have to look very deep we have to look deep and we have to look wide because on the surface life is a mean son of a and life is cruel and vindictive and it's just filled it's decimated by by circumstances that just crush the human heart from a reincarnational perspective the awareness is that life did not our life did not begin with birth and our life does not end at death that our life is part of a larger story why one would choose someone would choose a life that involves so much suffering is a maybe an impossible question to answer from within inside of time space perspective and from within an individual homocentric perspective in order to perhaps Glimpse some of the larger patterns of life we really have to open up into a very large perspective an evolutionary perspective a spiritual perspective the important I think the most important thing to be aware or to understand is that all of our suffering is preser is conserved and used and it's all of our suffering all human suffering is experienced by the Divine there is no Divine outside of human suffering watching us suffering doing something that's making it possible or not possible but everything that Humanity suffers everything that the animal kingdom suffers the spiritual World suffers um at a very deep level so uh yeah I mean if we are the as we talked about before the universe experiencing itself it's not just the people with awesome lives that the universe is experiencing right it's every instantiation of the universe every life the ones that suffer and the ones that don't suffer as much and I you know and I address this in in life cycles human suffering brings us to our knees and I don't think we have an adequate understanding or explanation of it in my experience when I have been drawn into this larger over View and when I have experienced the intelligence behind of this process I have found myself trusting beyond what I can understand and I trust because of the quality of the of the being that I encounter that's behind these circumstances so I can't understand all the pain behind all this and I can I have I can come up with any number of kind of partial and incomplete theories for how this stuff works or how it goes but in the end I think we're ultimately brought to our knees in trying to understand it intellectually but if you experience the love and wisdom of the universe then it gives us confidence that there truly is a logic to it and now I want to say I want the universe is a hard Taskmaster and you know if when you look at pictures of kie the Destroyer uh you know and she's a liberator of of brings about Enlightenment but she brings death and destruction in one hand and Enlightenment of the other these things go together there is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine it is a fierce fierce place that we are part of it's a very very demanding world but the question is does the universe in a deeper sense is it paying attention to our pain is it is there a way in which by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can does it lead to our own development in the long term and is the universe listening to us as we are in pain and I think it is I think it is a an intentional process even though I can't answer your question satisfactorily well it was a beautiful answer and really appreciate you taking it uh and and trying to answer that question Chris cuz I certainly feel like I'm on my knees and I think I read somewhere maybe this was you or or someone else but that the Divine as you've described it is something that we can experience but not necessarily comprehend and that concept has actually brought me quite a bit of Peace as somebody who's you know a self-described truth Seeker really really wanting to understand things thinking that that would give me some kind of um assurance that everything would be okay or uh help me understand what I should do or shouldn't do you know kind of a typical um experience of somebody who's looking for for the answers so permission to not know all the answers is quite comforting yeah and Chris do you have uh um certain uh people you count as teachers or um like your philosophical and spiritual um perspective and and leanings now I'm thinking of that question that you know I hope we can get into next of how does one uh proceed on a path of exploration like this wisely um what are good Preparatory um you know philosophies and spiritual Frameworks and systems to to check out or try on perhaps yeah well I had the benefit of being a professor of religious studies and so I spent a lot of my life my professional life um teaching courses in um comparative mysticism in Buddhism uh in you know introductory courses in eastern traditions and Western traditions and so I got to study a lot of the Masters and uh learn their stories and they were always my kind of guidepost the great Masters the great Spiritual Beings were always is even though my work was not focused on Spiritual Awakening we haven't talked too much about that but still the great Masters were my touchstones and I tried to hold myself accountable to them um as I conducted myself in this unusual spiritual practice I indigenous cultures I have tremendous respect for I have not academically studied them I have a you know kind of a Layman's reading of a number of books and respect for them uh and I really appreciate that people who are undertaking this type of work it's very beneficial to do it under the toage of an experienced teacher of a guide or someone who can help them process what they're experiencing that hasn't been my particular Destiny my particular work I've never had uh a teacher uh I've never been advised by an elder in a psychedelic community in this way the only teacher that I've personally had has been the universe itself and and she has been a Fierce and a loyal uh uh teacher she's broken me down ground me up spit me out and beat me severely and she's also held me and blessed me and loved me and taught me more things than I ever imagined were possible when we do this type of work uh it's foolish to do it alone these were my circumstances and I had the Constitution to survive it and I had the companionship of my partner who was a very wise spiritual woman who helped keep me grounded and I had the advice of the elders that I was studying in my courses for most people when we do this work it's do it's good to do this work in groups it's good to do this work under the guidance of someone who has more experience in these states than we do because this is a new territory and uh at in when I say A guidance I don't me someone who's guiding our experiences but someone who can help us enter these states safely and someone who can help us understand and process the our experiences when we come back out of that and I think it's important to have people that we can talk to this was one of the burdens of my particular journey and that because I was working in isolation because it was all illegal uh I could not bring it to the office I could not bring it to campus I could not talk to my students about it I'm a teacher I love to learn and share and I'm a gabber so I could not talk about this stuff and that's not a healthy way to be it's good to have community that you can share your experiences with and that you can listen to other people's experiences and ask that experience grows we know that we're all in this together we really learn from each other as we going deeper into this so I think it's really important uh to do this work in a responsible way with uh the guidance or tutelage of people who have more experience than you do yeah oh thank you for that and and I know uh time is whizzing by as it tends to do but I'm just on the edge of my seat dying to know if there's anything you could share about the birth of the diamond Soul or however you put it or that second part of the uh the kind of evolution and Ecology of Consciousness or or where we might focus our intentions on a path forward yeah well about halfway through my journey in the 38th session in a a year of great blessings of just enormous blessings I was taken on experience that was preceded with some very very intense purification processes very intense death rebirth process and at one phase in this journey I had the experience of all my former lives coming into me I mean I had done past life therapy before I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives I'd already written the book on reincarnation so I was comfortable with the idea of reincarnation but I began to experience my former lives coming into me and it was like winding a a string around a kite pool and what happened is they seemed to hit a critical mass and when they hit a critical mass they fused and there was there was an explosion of energy and all of these Separate Lives fused into one life there was an explosion of diamond light out of my chest and I was catapulted into a state of con Consciousness that was beyond anything that I had realized up to that point in time I was an individual but an individual Beyond any frame of reference that I had known before and I came and then I was given a whole lot of teachings and over and over again so that I would understand what was happening and this came to be it changed my whole understanding of how reincarnation works and where it's taking us the classic understanding of reincarnation in eastern cultures is that you know you incarnate you make some Pro your self-challenge you make mistakes you make progress but basically you get better and better stronger and stronger more compassionate over time until eventually you reach some type of spiritual realization some Awakening experience Enlightenment experience and once you reach that then you're free to leave the system of SpaceTime so it's an up andout C cosmology and all the religions of the axial age of last 5,000 years are all up andout cosmologies so you achieve salvation and then or you achieve enlightenment and then the fruition comes in an off-planet spiritual Paradise my experience in my sessions the teaching I received in my sessions is that that is not an adequate description of what's Happening that's a first stage approximation that Humanity made when they be began to have sufficient depth of experiences that they began to have contact with spiritual reality they began to understand reincarnation but it's stopping halfway I think the what I was shown in in my experiences was that humanity is not simply evolving one lifetime after a lifetime after lifetime making small incremental improvements in our quality of the Soul's existence sooner or later I mean we sooner or later all of our Lives come together inside our physical existence now we die we expand into the soul we incarnate into our narrow egoic experience we die incarnate in the soul we incarnate in an individual lifetime we know the soul in between our lifetimes but if we keep this incarnational Rhythm up long enough and I have my students sometimes do this as an exercise for 15 minutes we're doing this each lifetime expanding out sooner or later the soul wakes up inside our physical existence and this is what I call the birth of the diamond Soul when the soul wakes up inside our physical existence not only is there a tremendous expansion of our heart and mind but it changes our entire orientation it it it we focus on the long-term Vision the long-term good the wide good because we have in a sense an intuitive awareness of all the hundreds of people thousands of people we've been in relationship with through history we have been every race we've been every religion through time we've been up and down the economic ladder we've had all the roles in history possible that when all those lives come together and wake up into a singular Consciousness it radically changes one's perceptive perception of what's taking place who we are and where we're going I think this when people ask what form will the future human take and we're exploring this with all sorts of Science Fiction you know what the form of the future human will be but I think it's really much more simple than that we have been developing and gestating the future human for hundreds of thousands of years reincarnation we've been gestating the future human through reincarnation for hundreds of thousands of years gestation is long labor is short and intense I think we are entering a period of history of Labor and I think we are desperately trying to grow into the largest deepest richest version of ourselves and that is the diamond soul I think the diamond Diamond soul is being born in history The Diamond soul is the form that the future human would take and imagine if the entire species went through this process not just a few Christ and the Buddha and Muhammad and a few Saints privileged here and there but if the entire species went through this transition that they awakened spiritually to this deeper identity that's been gestating inside of them all these years what a what an extraordinary species that would be and what would that species what an extraordinary history that species would create I think we've reached a point in history where we simply cannot run this planet out of egoic Consciousness we either grow up or we go extinct and Extinction is a tremendous evolutionary accelerator so I think we are personally I think this crisis involving this century is going to take us to our Edge but my experience is that we do make it through this crisis I've I've experienced the future human as a task to be actualized and also an accomplishment that has already been realized so from my personal perspective I deeply believe that we will make it through this crisis we will make it through the developmental challenges and when we do and we're looking back over human history and our individual soul history we will recognize that everything all the pain we suffered all the hardship that we went through to get to this place it's been worth it it's been worth it we're giving birth to a new child in history and it will be worth it Chris I am finding myself feeling very grateful to you for your life's work for your willingness to share it I'm glad that you decided to to come forward and um share with you know all of us

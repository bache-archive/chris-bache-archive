00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.563
Well, here we are again
for our third discussion.

00:00:22.763 --> 00:00:28.140
And we tentatively gave the topic
for our-- this discussion limitless time,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.660
because we now want to bridge and-- into

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.380
the deeper questions
surrounding reincarnation,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.420
the deeper perspective.
Where is reincarnation taking humanity?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.260
Where is this constantly learning
and recycling and recycling,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.500
creating new and new platforms

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.500
in our incarnational experience
- where is it going?

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.100
Where is it taking us?

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.900
What might the deep future look like?

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.340
And, most importantly,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.200
how might that understanding shift how we
engage our life right here, right now?

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.680
Yeah. Very deep

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.600
questions to follow.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.880
Where should we begin?

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.800
Well, we should-- I think we should
acknowledge that each of us have

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.720
a deep, experiential basis that we're
kind of bringing to this discussion.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.380
We're not simply thinking about it,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.060
philosophising about it
and speculating about it.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.930
We have deep convictions born
out of unusual experiences.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.930
Why don't you speak first?

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.020
It's true.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.380
It's why-- it's in a way that's brought us

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.160
together around these-- to
do these dialogues, I think.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.210
And I was just explaining to-- you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.800
know, that to discriminate the difference
between knowledge and wisdom.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.980
You know, so, although

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.120
we've explored strains of knowledge in
this, wisdom is different from knowledge.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.260
It's the opposite in a way, because,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.420
for me, the way I understand wisdom is
that wisdom comes through revelation.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.400
It comes through listening.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.700
It comes through being
passive and then receiving.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.900
Whereas knowledge is something
that you do opposite.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.610
You go after it,
you chase it, you hunt it,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.300
you know. You're going towards it, instead
of allowing it to come towards you.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.640
And so

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.200
you get different

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.680
information

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.400
through revelation.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.100
And it's not information in the same way.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.560
It's cellular.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.480
You know, so my experience

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.920
that's led to me being me, and doing what
I do, is because I have always had this,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.880
you know, cellular understanding, cellular
knowing of what's coming for humanity.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.820
And it's always-- it's quite hard to hold
that - I'm sure you relate to that, Chris.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.540
It's quite hard to hold it because
it's-- not everyone else has it.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.880
And so

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.300
it puts you-- it puts me in a-- I'm more

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.300
relaxed than most people I know
at a fundamental level, because

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.200
I have this knowing
that everything's going to be fine.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.182
And I can't explain that knowing,

00:03:17.382 --> 00:03:20.060
or even why it was
given to me to have it.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.300
And I know that many
people listening to this

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.900
will have a resonance, and have had

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.460
breakthroughs and visions
where that has come to them.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.560
So,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.520
you know-- I think it's really good for us
to acknowledge it, that we carry this

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.020
other dimension.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.420
And you obviously through your work,
I mean, tell us a little bit about that.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.100
It would be lovely to hear.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.380
I completely share what you're saying,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.860
because I do carry an unusual knowledge,
as you do. Now, at the beginning of our

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.610
series, we talked about
the evidence for reincarnation.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.660
So I was in my professorial mode there.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.900
The intellectual digesting
of this evidence.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.960
And

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.820
the middle-- the second conversation was
kind of a blending of that

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.610
type of knowledge and the type of wisdom,
that arises in my psychedelic work.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.380
And in today's discussion, I feel like I'm

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.400
standing squarely within
that other side of my life.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.020
I'm a visionary shaman.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.860
I'm a psychedelic visionary.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:27.700
My understanding comes out of the careful
distilling of conscientiously-engaged,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.180
non-ordinary states of consciousness,
again and again and again purifying

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.500
and purifying, and allowing the universe
to take me deeper and deeper

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:46.300
into what I experience as into itself
and into its intention - into

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.000
time, literally into deep time,
and giving me experiences

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.500
which were never intended
to be just for me.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.620
They are planted in me to hold and then
to pass on, as so many of you know, anyone

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.700
who has these deep experiences,
you know, they're never just for us.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.220
We hold them for the larger collective.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.540
So I do - like you I have a feeling for

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.440
what's happening in history,
where we're going.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.120
And it does tend to--

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.820
it gives me a calm and a relaxation,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.200
even as we enter into very difficult
and trying times ahead.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.580
Yeah, I think so.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.840
And I think both you and I have that same

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.148
kind of knowing, I suppose,

00:05:42.348 --> 00:05:44.800
that birth is

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.240
an intense event

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.780
and we're coming to a birth point.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.900
You know we're even in the canal,
and contractions are occurring.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.000
And

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.760
in the same way that,
you know, I understand

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.240
individual awakening,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.920
when awakening

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.900
comes into a body,
you know, and it comes spontaneously,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.720
it kind of comes through contractions,
in a sense. So often before

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.580
you have an experience,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.820
and a transcendental experience,
there are kind of shudders.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.620
And then there's openings and closings,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.260
there's condensing and intensification
of shadow material.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.700
And then there's a kind of opening up.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.320
And then there's another

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.660
birth contraction.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.840
And the contractions come
closer and closer together.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.520
And eventually there's

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.540
a deep opening to
an epiphany of some form,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.060
like something that shakes the core
of your being and maybe fires

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.860
within your DNA. So that it's something

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.260
that just sets you alight
and changes you forever, you know,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.160
when those revelations come.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.120
And so, you know, I think that

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.040
that's what's happening
on a planetary level as well.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.740
It's beginning to happen as a collective.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.960
And your writings, Chris,
particularly through

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.803
your 'Mind of the Universe', you know,
'Diamonds' book,

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:19.240
it describes so beautifully

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.800
this process of,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.220
like, coming into-- coming down
the birth canal.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.380
What it doesn't do, obviously,

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.920
and what neither of us can do,
is fill in the details, you know,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.060
and only time can do that.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.160
But

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.180
we'd like to give a bit of backdrop and
both empathise with the intensity

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:47.100
of the suffering that is already here,
and is most likely going to be ramped up.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.700
We want to empathise with that.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.520
But at the same time,
we want to present this

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.540
knowing that we have
that gives people hope, more than hope,

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.140
actually. But it also provides
some hope, doesn't it?

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.540
Like, there is a purpose

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.660
to the events that are taking place on our
planet right now,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.840
and right now is whenever you're
watching this. You know, because

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.000
one can only imagine

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.560
more events

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.560
occurring as this canal opens up. So

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.720
yeah.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.620
Yeah. You described that process

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:31.160
of the in-breaking of the vision
and the being drawn into the deep

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.520
experience of revelation. Because,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.260
you know, deep visions, deep insights,

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.540
cannot fit themselves
into small containers.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.880
And so when

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.940
nature, or the Divine, or the universe,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:51.780
invites us into a deeper experience,
a more conscious understanding of life,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.380
it has to purify ourselves.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.740
And you described
that contracting process.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.860
And it is our past, it's everything about
us which keeps us small,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:07.500
being burned up inside us in order to
allow ourselves to be taken, shattered.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.220
In my context, it's the death-rebirth
cycle, to die to everything within us

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.260
which holds us where we are,
and to be reborn into a larger world.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.020
And that can happen again and again,

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.810
taking us deeper and deeper
into that knowing.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.180
It's like any spiritual path,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.980
there are no shortcuts,
and there's no easy way into this.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.740
It's always a very exacting and a very

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.400
demanding road.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.260
But the fruit of that road

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.320
is,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.060
well, it's personal, and it's collective,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.380
it expands around us in all sorts
of subtle and mysterious ways.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.500
And we are part of a lineage,

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.580
each of us in our own ways,

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:57.580
a lineage of people who have asked
for more, and who have been given more,

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.300
and have paid the price
for being given more.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.920
And you're right, this is--

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.700
my work started
as thinking of my psychedelic work as kind

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:14.260
of a personal healing, or personal
transformation, or personal awakening,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.500
and that just got shattered
in the first few years.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.380
And everything about my word kept opening
up into collective vistas,

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.680
collective spaces, being drawn
into the collective psyche,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.740
going through collective purifications

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:35.280
and opening up into insight about our
collective developmental process.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.220
Experiencing reincarnation not simply as

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.180
an individual soul-journey,
but as a species-journey.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.940
It's a journey that our entire

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.780
species is on,
evolving itself through the systematic

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.620
reincarnation,
generation after generation,

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.920
moving forward and then

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.280
being given a certain understanding about

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.300
-- that this reincarnation process for us

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.300
individually, and collectively,
is coming into a crescendo.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:12.100
It's coming into some type of
profound breakthrough,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.620
and you've languaged it as a 'birth'.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.420
And I think that's absolutely correct.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:22.020
And birth involves labour, and it involves
a change from one state to another state.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.300
For a child, it's a change from a
water-being to a land-being.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.980
And we are, I think, are growing

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.420
from a state of individual
egoic-awareness,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:38.860
where identity is fundamentally our body
-mind-ego, into a soul-awareness,

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:46.380
where all of our former lives are coming
together in a tremendous fusion point.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.180
As our knowledge of our past deepens,
and as we heal the traumas of our past

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.700
that we're all carrying,
and our past lives become more

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.060
integrated,
and we integrate not only their pains

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.620
but their virtues, their
great assets, their capacities.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.420
And all of this begins to take place.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:09.220
And it's like our lives come together,
and eventually they hit a fusion point.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.275
And at that point the soul
becomes one, totally,

00:12:14.475 --> 00:12:19.300
as I've experienced this,
an explosion of light,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:25.300
an explosion into a higher order
of individuality,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:31.060
with a different threshold, a different
sense of communion with the surrounding

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.400
intelligence of the universe,
the intelligence of the Divine.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.400
But-- and it's a different-- to me,

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:43.020
if humanity is going through this process,
which I deeply believe it is,

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.020
that's what my visions have
shown me, again and again.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.760
It represents a new

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.040
foundation

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.460
for the human story,
a new phase of the human story. Just as

00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.540
profound as when we made this jump, about
200,000 years ago, to a brain that's 50%

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.580
bigger than the brain that we
were carrying before.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.940
Allowing us to think and do things
that we could never do before.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:13.140
This is something which is going to change
the fundamental archetypal architecture

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.560
of the collective unconscious.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.560
Yeah, beautifully said.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.700
It kind of brings
two things I'd like to say in response,

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.220
which are really reiterations
of what you've said.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.120
And the first is

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.160
that many people watching this,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.060
if you're drawn to this kind of material,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.100
there's a very good chance
that you have said 'yes'

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:45.080
to receiving, to transmuting
more shadow material, you know,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.080
more than one lifetime's worth.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.720
And I remember those dark days
of my kind of past, in which the shadow--

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.260
the level of shadow inside my body
seemed insurmountable,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.680
you know, and seemed

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.240
endless.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.820
You know, whenever I would meditate,

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:14.060
I would just find endless weight
and heaviness and oppression.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:20.340
And, like, so much of it that
it was just this big, thick clot.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.080
And how would I ever,
ever burn through that?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.780
And gradually, over the years,
happily for me, and it's lightened.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.840
And

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.160
so I've seen the light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.020
And I say this because I know that many
watching this will also have

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.820
that experience of
grappling with a weight inside

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:51.880
the physical, emotional reality,
the mental reality, that far outweighs,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.020
you know, the kind of-- the individual
wounding patterns of one life,

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.460
you know, whatever they are.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:04.097
And that's not to kind of,
you know, put them lesser,

00:15:04.297 --> 00:15:07.800
but, you know, we've taken on more.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.740
And the reason we've taken on more is
because we are capable of taking on more.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.220
So if you feel that heaviness

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.940
and weight in you, it's because
you have the capacity.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.680
The deep, overwhelming,

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.040
you know, the love

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.260
that's great enough to burn through that.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.820
So I say that to encourage people

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:35.040
to continue on in your transformational
path and not to lose hope.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.720
And the other thing
I wanted to say is, you know,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.538
when you look at
times like this, like birth,

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:53.320
and as you said, there's something
that emerges that is completely new.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.580
When we're looking at life as it is today,

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.660
through the lens of history,
we see a continuity.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.540
You know, we see this continuity,
this fairly unbroken continuity,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.220
with blips, and ups and downs,
and cycles repeating,

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:12.400
and we see that through the patterns
of our recorded history.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.680
And

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.440
the one thing
we never-- you never see in birth

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.760
is you can't see beyond the break,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.120
because at some point there's
a break in the continuity.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.060
And then something completely new is born.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.380
As you said, it's assembled out
of all the elements of the old.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:38.220
It's condensed, it's revealed from all
those elements coming into a symphony.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.020
And so it's completely different.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.300
It stands on the shoulders of all that,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.780
of all that's great and all that's
been suffering.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.700
And all of that is suddenly

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.940
kind of compressed,
like the beginning of the universe.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.980
You know, it was compressed
into this tiny space.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.580
And that's what happens is
this incredible compression.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.900
And then there's this opening,
as you said, an expansion of vast light.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.420
So what I'm pointing towards
is that what's coming

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.844
has no similarity to what we have now.

00:17:10.044 --> 00:17:16.900
We cannot-- you know with our wildest
imagination, we can begin to approach it,

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:23.050
but you have to-- you know you never
see a break in continuity coming.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.330
You always assume, all of you,
humans, this is our way.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.500
We see that things have
always been this way.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.810
They'll always continue.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.290
Maybe we're going to continue
on this path, and then we'll get robotics

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.290
and we'll get technology, and we'll get
this, and then we'll go to the stars.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.840
And, you know, we think in the way
that we've been trained to think,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.250
until one of these crux points comes.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.320
And then it just smashes everything. And,

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.220
in a way, a whole new epoch begins,

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.787
something completely new
with different technology,

00:17:52.987 --> 00:17:56.220
you know, and we're the technology,
you know, we are the technology!

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.160
I've been saying this to people, like,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.250
it's inside us.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:04.330
You know our DNA has capacities,
undreamed-of capacities.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:10.220
And so I think it's really important
that people grasp that, that what's coming

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.240
bears no resemblance
to what has been, you know.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.810
Yes, I completely agree with you.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.320
I mean this is what happens
in a psychedelic session as well.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.620
I mean I-- first, I completely
affirm what you're saying about the weight

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:29.220
and the burden that so many serious
practitioners are experiencing.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.920
I think it's because

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.770
there's a lot of their past,

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.620
which is past lives' Karma
which they're working and clearing now.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.010
But it's also collective karma, that

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.803
great beings, and I think there are many
more hidden saints than we might think,

00:18:45.003 --> 00:18:47.180
they have taken on responsibility

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:50.900
for working
on behalf of humanity as a whole,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.700
so that they are engaging darkness
that comes not just from their personal

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:59.220
history or soul history,
but from our collective history.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.330
And we have to get through
this period quickly.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.460
We have to bring about this transformation

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:09.420
or cooperate with this process,
because as every mother knows,

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.010
you don't want the foetus to get
stuck in the birth canal.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.420
It's not a good place to be.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.980
We want to keep everything moving through.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.140
And I think that many, many souls

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.980
incarnating in this period of history
saw what they were getting into,

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.860
knew what they were getting into,
and chose to do this work.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.940
The work of birthing a new
humanity is great work.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.460
And, you're right, it's a discontinuity.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.250
In a session you go deep, deep,

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.660
deep into the pain, and it just looks
like it's never, ever, ever going to end.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.860
You can't imagine how this
will ever reconcile itself.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.770
And then there is a breaking point.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.290
There's a point of absolute surrender,
of absolute cost paid.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.680
And then

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.940
there is a waking-up, a

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:59.460
waking-up in a new reality which is not an
extension of the old reality in any way.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.570
You can't get to this new reality

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.940
by refining, purifying and even
healing the old reality.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:11.290
It is being catapulted
in something which is a fundamentally

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.050
-- a new genre of experience,
a new set of capacities.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.380
In my experience and my sessions,
when I've been taken

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.700
deep into the experience of deep-time,
into the deep future,

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.380
that's how I have experienced
the course of humanity as well.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.320
That we seem to be

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.860
first many, many visions over and over,

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.000
and of course my visions,
these are old [inaudible].

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:41.290
I started having these visions in 1991,
so these are pushing 30 years old now,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.800
but a series of visions that we
are coming to a turning point.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.560
The pace of the past

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.400
could not be used to measure
the pace of the future. A

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.500
turn-- a before-and-after point, that
after this historical transition

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.500
we would be operating at a completely
different psycho-spiritual structure.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.330
We would be generating a different

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.920
civilisation,
because we would be different beings.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:17.860
We would not be confined and fragmented
the way we are now. I mean basically

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.500
our relationship with nature

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.460
that we are experiencing now,
the damage that we've done to nature,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:28.520
was done by a species operating out
of the egoic level of consciousness,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.090
which is

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.770
a fundamentally-- which is a brilliant
level of consciousness.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.420
But it's fragmented.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.380
It's fragmented from each other.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.480
It's fragmented from

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.500
foundational-- from the
foundation of life itself.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:44.010
A species which is operating with a healed

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.660
heart and a healed mind,
an open heart that embraces

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:53.090
the great breath of its own
experience and human experience,

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:59.240
and an open mind which is open
to a deeper communion, a deeper taking-in

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.740
from higher orders of intelligence,
higher orders of knowing,

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.240
such a being

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.940
lives in the world differently

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.460
than a human being does today.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.810
The soul lives in the world
differently than the ego.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.260
The soul knows that the world that it

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.980
leaves is the world
that it's coming back to.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.180
So it takes better care of the world.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:27.180
The soul knows that its relationships
have a depth of texture and history.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.740
You don't walk away
from any relationships.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.500
And so you take more care

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:36.400
of all of your relationships
and of all the people in that too,

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.180
because this is an ongoing
developmental process.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.660
And I think we are coming
into a point where

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.400
the irony is

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.330
life is not giving us any option
except to go through this transition.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.050
There's no going back.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.810
The Earth is not going to allow us.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.740
We've done so much damage to it.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.540
This damage is coming up to us now.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.460
We cannot continue living,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:04.380
even in a simplified version
of how we have gotten here.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:09.570
We have to reach into something
entirely new, something radically new.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.140
And I think you're right,
that this is happening on the outside,

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:18.220
and we are being called to a new
relationship to the Earth on the outside,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.940
but we are carrying within our hearts

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.420
all the problems that have
gotten here-- gotten us here.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:31.040
And we are carrying all the values,
and the potentials, and the insights

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.680
which are taking us beyond this
into a different order. It's all

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.260
inside.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:41.980
You and I focus our work
on the inside dance.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.290
There are other people whose work is
to focus on the outside dance,

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.760
to bring out the changes in the outer
world to get us through.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.520
All are needed.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:24:00.810
So true and, you know, beautifully put,
and the inner transformation that you just

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.160
described-- I mean, one thing that
I'm reminded of,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.500
those, if you know-- if anyone's
seen or is familiar with any

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:15.040
of Shakespeare's plays, particularly
the comedies and the tragi-comedies,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:23.391
you know, like in some of those plays
everything that can go wrong goes wrong.

00:24:23.591 --> 00:24:27.520
And the wrong people fall in love
with the wrong people.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.180
The-- everything gets twisted round.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.220
It's like one of those nightmares where
it's just, like-- and you've got to act

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:38.080
four, and usually there's five acts,
and it's still a complete mess.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.810
And your-- and as-- in the audience
you're going, 'Oh, my God.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.570
How is this ever going to be resolved?'

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.980
And then he does this magical thing,

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:49.290
where suddenly there's a kind of strange
attractor that comes in, some force,

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.180
or some event,
that just suddenly triggers all these,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:58.940
like, sub-events that makes everyone
end up with the right person.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:03.460
And everything just gets healed
and is 'happily-ever-after' story.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.720
But it happens very quickly,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.290
you know, always right
compressed in the last moment.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.385
And in a way it's a bit similar,

00:25:11.585 --> 00:25:15.600
our time, because we've
had this long, slow,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.260
you know, build-up to create

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.640
this mess.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.920
And then there's this sudden kind of,

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.320
you know, cataclysmic

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.020
energy at the end,
that then just-- in which you could never

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.940
quite see how these things
are all going to be resolved.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.900
But they get resolved, and in a completely

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.560
different way from what
we-- you were expecting.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.540
So, you know, I-- and one of the things

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:48.980
that you've spoken of a lot, Chris,
is the speed at which things happen.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.080
And we can see that in natural systems,

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.980
you can just see it in water boiling.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.940
It's the most obvious one, perhaps.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.380
You look at the water and nothing seems

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.140
to be happening, and nothing
seems to be happening.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.740
And you put more and more and more heat

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.540
into it, and then some
bubbles start to appear,

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.180
just the first little pricks
of bubbles on the surface.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.260
And then, of course, suddenly,
when it hits that one

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.810
boiling point, everything just erupts.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.640
And you have steam, you know.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.980
And this water starts
to just change its state.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.620
And it's such a simple metaphor.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.220
But it's so true
throughout the whole of nature.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:30.050
And if you look at the whole
of humanity and history, you know,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.400
in a way

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.810
that's what those-- that's a period
that's a-- that we're reaching.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.160
And we'll begin to see that more and more.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.600
And the scientists
are pointing to those things,

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.500
like the ocean, for example,

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:49.460
is capturing a huge amount of CO2,
and it's called 'the sink'.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:53.600
You know, it's just-- it's sinking
down deep into the deep ocean

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.980
where that CO2 is being stored.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.140
And it's slowly building up, and building

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:02.780
up, and building up until the ocean
will be able to no longer

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.050
capture any more CO2.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:10.734
And from that point onwards, and
it's allegedly already occurred,

00:27:10.934 --> 00:27:14.420
it weakens. Its ability to store CO2

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.620
weakens and therefore
all the CO2 that we're creating

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.090
suddenly explodes into the atmosphere.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.377
And it looks like we've
been in this hiatus,

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:30.780
you know, and we have because there's
this illusion that we've been okay.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.260
And then suddenly everything speeds up

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.600
much more quickly than
anyone could possibly

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.360
have conceived,

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.620
except some of the scientists

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.220
who really know that,
who've really analysed the data deeply.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:45.840
And also,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.660
you know, cross-- people who work across

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.740
multiple fields,
you know, systems theorists and people

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:58.320
who really see the interconnectivity
of different systems can see the whole.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.560
And, of course, mystics, like us.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.880
So there are

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.320
many who are, kind of,
predicting very, very quick

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.020
change that can be very
destabilising for this planet.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.080
And I know you--

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.880
I'd love to hear what you saying
-- what I want to say about this but--

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.090
and we don't say to alarm, but to prepare.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.920
Because it goes alongside
the inner awakening.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.330
As the inner birth takes place,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.660
something on the outside,
the structure, has to

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:40.900
decline, it has to fall away in order for
this new [waves hands] to come through.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.080
It's a universal law,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.810
and it's essential, you know, as you said,

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.180
we can't repair the old system.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.900
That doesn't mean we shouldn't try
and repair the old system.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.900
Because there can be one,
you know, hearing all this, you can think,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.120
'Well, I'm not going to do anything then,
I'm just going to sit here.'

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.400
And that's an understandable

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.520
response, and yet it's not
a truly compassionate response,

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.640
you know, because
compassion also involves passion,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.134
and we need to stand up for
what's right, and for justice,

00:29:15.334 --> 00:29:18.940
and what else-- what is
the purpose of being here?

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.330
So we need to continue

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.020
forwards and use our passion wherever
we are called to do so.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.123
That's part of our responsibility,

00:29:28.323 --> 00:29:31.660
and that's part of what it
means to be an awakening being.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:37.900
And yet at the same time, we can have this
other part of us that knows, 'Well,

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:42.760
I'm going to do whatever I can
while this is collapsing.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.290
You know, I'm going to give-- I'm going to
serve in the best way I possibly can.'

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.140
And that's how you know that you will

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.540
always be in the right place,
you'll always be in a safe place.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.660
And when I say 'safe', I mean

00:29:55.690 --> 00:30:03.220
safe in the sense that you're aligned with
the core of your soul and its destiny.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.840
That's a safe place to be.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.503
Yeah, that place of alignment,

00:30:10.703 --> 00:30:15.240
yeah. You know the way
that speeding-up process

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.520
worked itself out in my sessions,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.920
and it had to do with understanding
the field dynamics of consciousness.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.220
I have just enough understanding of chaos

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:34.680
theory and non-equilibrium systems to have
a rudimentary understanding of what

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.660
physicists, or chaoticians

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:42.260
understand - when the system gets more
and more energy poured into it,

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:46.740
it reaches a state of non
-equilibrium or far-from-equilibrium.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.220
And when it's in that condition like
the water, which is getting more and more

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.420
energy poured into it, or a bathtub when
you keep increasing the quantity of water

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:58.706
that's going into the tub,
and the ripples get-- they start to change,

00:30:58.906 --> 00:31:02.780
we come to a tripping point-- a tipping
point, a bifurcation point,

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:07.940
where the system has too much energy
to maintain its current structures,

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:12.980
and it does a flip into a different
organisational pattern.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.860
It goes through this bifurcation point,
it chooses a different future.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:19.700
It flips into a higher
organisational pattern.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.940
And when physical systems
reach non-equilibrium points,

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:25.620
they can do extraordinary things.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.420
They can produce new particles.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.780
They can produce orders of coherence

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:35.360
within themselves that would have been
impossible at a lower energy state.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:41.940
In my visionary experiences,
I was given to see that all of humanity,

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:47.700
we are all fractal nodes within unified
field, a field of consciousness,

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:54.380
the human unconscious, the collective
unconscious is a field, and it is

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:59.900
an energetic field which reflects
all of our individual experiences.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.680
And when enough

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.980
individual experiences become untenable,
when they become so painful, we just

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:12.000
reach out in desperation
for a different solution to the situation

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.700
- it's not just we individually are going
through this type of ordeal

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.940
of transformation,
but all of us collectively.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.940
We've never had anything happen in history

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:25.500
which is comparable
to what's coming at us now.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:29.810
Because when we've had hurricanes or great
natural disasters, they've always affected

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.660
one part of the world,
but not the other part of the world.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:37.860
But the global systems crisis that seems
to be imminent, being driven by a global

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:42.020
ecological crisis,
is going to affect all continents,

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.310
all people, all places.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.160
That's going to push humanity

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.860
into a different experiential field.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.380
And the point here is that the collective

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.940
psyche is going to be energised
by all of this disruption.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.780
It literally is going to begin to boil

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.940
underneath us, underneath our
individual minds.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:07.240
And my understanding
of what's happening is

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.420
that in evolution there are, kind of,

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:15.380
multiple levels of evolution, at least,
say, two levels of evolution.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.540
We and I are being born
over and over again.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:22.140
We're born for 100 years at a time -
we live 100 years, 100 years.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:24.180
But underneath those 100 year cycles,

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:28.500
there is a learning taking place, there is
a developmental process taking place.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.020
We usually refer to this as the soul.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.020
So the individual ego incarnates,

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:39.180
but the soul is growing, becoming more,
becoming more, suffusing our lives.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.900
But the same thing happens collectively.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.540
Every generation, every generation,

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.330
billions and billions of people are being

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.338
born, but there is a learning
gathering underneath them,

00:33:50.538 --> 00:33:53.180
that is collecting all of their learning

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.500
in these deep, deep,
collective archetypal structures.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.220
That's what's coming to boil,
not just our individual incarnation,

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:05.330
but that underlying structures
coming into a high energy state.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.020
And I think it's coming to a state where

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:11.420
the sheer energy of our suffering,

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:16.690
the energy of our despair,
or the energy of our anxiety,

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.460
is driving us to a breaking point

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:25.500
where suddenly we're going to be flooded
with a different kind of common sense,

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.940
a different common sense,
a different set of priorities,

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:33.650
a different set of values,
a different experience of each other.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.540
The only way I think that we can

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:41.320
go as far as we need to go in order
to save ourselves, and the planet

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.540
in as little time as we have,
is to understand

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.690
the dynamics of the collective

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.740
unconscious,
the field-dynamics of consciousness and

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:57.500
that-- how fields operate
in non-equilibrium systems.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.780
At least this is what
has come through my visionary experience,

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:04.340
over and over,
that we are coming to a point where

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:10.460
there is a crisis which builds
in intensity, until it looks like

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:12.000
all is lost.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.920
So much disruption,
so much loss of control,

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.440
so much

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.320
death, challenged at a very deep level.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.160
But when it's at its worst

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.200
it begins to pass.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.780
We pick ourselves up.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:33.980
We somehow rise to the
challenge of this crisis.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.940
And in rising to the challenge,

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.740
we are changed, we are profoundly changed,
such that as we

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:45.980
become-- start to come out of this period
of history, we find that what our nature,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.100
the nature that we are carrying,
its not just a different set of attitudes,

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:57.060
not just a different set of beliefs,
but a fundamental-- a fundamentally new

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:58.740
way of being conscious.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.940
A new organisation of our
consciousness emerges.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.420
Something has shifted in place.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:10.940
And we find that things which
were not easy are suddenly easy.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.820
Things which are out of reach
are suddenly within reach.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:19.100
Possibilities are emerging much faster
than we would have ever predicted.

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.740
That's the type of transformation
I think we're looking at. A

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.960
truly--

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.020
a rebirth of humanity,

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:31.560
so that-- in my work, I call it 'the
birth of the future human.' You know

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:38.460
it's truly a demarcation of a different
kind of human being emerging.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.560
Now,

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.420
I think our history is creating this.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:46.380
It's reincarnation, which is
coming to a phase of fruition.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.897
And I think we can get insights,

00:36:49.097 --> 00:36:54.260
or glimmers of what the future
will look like by looking at the great

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.420
beings of our past, the great saints,
the great prophets,

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:03.520
the great incarnations, the Christs,
the Buddhas, the prophets,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:10.130
those great beings who have always called
us into a higher order of existence.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.740
Those are prototypes, I think.
The prototypes which give us

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:18.060
an inclination and an understanding
of what we are in the process of becoming

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:22.130
as a species, collectively.
I think we are truly becoming

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.500
a species of Christs,
a species of Buddhas, a species

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.120
of prophets, you know,

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:34.200
with that magnitude,
that tremendous scale of heart.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:39.120
I don't know how long it's going to
take us to make this transition.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.820
Clearly, the ecological crisis,

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:46.500
which is fermenting, is a crisis that's
going to be deepening for generations.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.400
It will be at least three
generations, four generations

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.040
before we hit

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.210
the peak of these-- of this crisis.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.940
But I think we will come through it.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.975
And I think we're not talking
thousands and thousands of years,

00:38:01.175 --> 00:38:04.980
we're talking-- we have to make
this within a few hundred years

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.170
to make this transition.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.940
And I think the 21st century
is the key century

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:17.280
of the unravelling - it is where we
make key choices that shape our future.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.380
And one of the other things that happens

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:25.980
in non-equilibrium systems is that
individual changes, small changes

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.460
can catapult into massive outcomes.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:29.820
So the butterfly,

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:35.170
whose wing in China sets off a hurricane
across the planet - that metaphor

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.960
that individuals who have
achieved within themselves

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.960
something of what humanity
is aspiring to change

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.720
for solving these large problems -

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.880
the impact of individuals
increases exponentially

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.120
in non-equilibrium systems.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.340
So, just in contrast, if we look just

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.900
to the past we say, 'Well,
the individual can't do anything.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:03.020
We're being overwhelmed by-- just

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:07.690
it's overwhelming historical forces are
coming at us.' It's just the opposite.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.120
As things

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.520
intensify,

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.200
the individual becomes

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.060
more significant, a more
significant player.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:18.020
So beings who achieve

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:22.560
a wholeness within their person,
they achieve

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.560
a robust

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:30.380
soul-consciousness in their person,
have a tremendous catalysing effect

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:34.200
on people around them,
coming to their own version

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.120
of that deep experience

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.400
as well.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.320
Thank you.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.880
I love listening to you,
when you go off on a transmission.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.480
I was thinking,

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.360
you know, if you were to ask yourself

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.340
what one thing-- if there was one thing

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:59.680
that happened on this planet
that could change everything

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.900
quickly overnight,
what might that one thing be?

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.960
And

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.560
inside me the answer

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.360
was-- it is that for us to see
through the veil of death. You know,

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.080
because the moment

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:20.820
one person sees through the veil of death,
fear is no more, it just isn't.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:26.292
There is no fear
because that's where fear resides.

00:40:26.492 --> 00:40:28.640
So the intensification

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.840
of the energy you're talking
about, the suffering,

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.100
you know, the love,

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:37.280
all of it pouring towards this one
kind of point, this-- you know,

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:46.440
it's the only thing that has the power
to pierce that veil, that veil of death.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.853
And so what I would expect,

00:40:50.053 --> 00:40:53.060
and what I have sort of seen

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:57.380
through the Gene Keys and through
my teachings and transmissions,

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.690
is that more and more people

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.680
will gradually,

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.380
as this boiling takes place,

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.480
experience

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.920
their consciousness, you know,

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.980
having the ability to transcend

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:16.706
life, birth and death, that cycle of life,

00:41:16.906 --> 00:41:22.690
you know. And be able to-- that
consciousness will retain the memory

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.120
between life, birth and death,

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.946
and carry it across.

00:41:27.146 --> 00:41:29.760
And what that-- you know, because

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.980
that's pure awakening
and when a being has that layer-- that

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.340
level of awakening,
and they're sitting there manifesting,

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.520
or standing there just moving
around being who they are

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.130
and that is being emanated,
it is electrifying.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.837
It's electrifying to anyone else,
it's catching, it's contagious.

00:41:50.037 --> 00:41:52.500
You know, the transmission of wisdom,

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.340
and love, and awakening
is contagious, you know,

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.500
most people will know this.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:04.340
You go near one of these beings and
you can feel it, it crackles in the air.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.560
And so the more and more

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.880
that is occurring,
the more and more this veil

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.160
of-- will be breaking down.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.020
And then fear will start to leave

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:20.540
this planet gradually,
person-by-person, person-by-person,

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.460
generation-by-generation.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.980
And I even believe

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.260
deep inside myself that that will enable

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:32.420
children to come through,
to be born, without

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.100
the wound of humanity.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:36.120
You know, just be born awake, you know,

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.920
and therefore

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.060
not have those-- not have to
go through this journey.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:46.460
And, of course, those children are us,
those are our future vehicles,

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:49.460
and they will be born
through those awakened ones.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:52.260
You know, because
if you have two awakened ones coming

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:56.800
together to bring a child,
then you have a clear conduit.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.534
You know, and that's a vessel
that you might want to jump into,

00:43:01.734 --> 00:43:04.260
to experience, and then
more, and more of that.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:08.340
And that so, in a way,
you could almost perceive that that's how

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:12.650
the awakened consciousness
will colonise the gene pool

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.690
of humanity.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.880
Literally

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.460
like a virus of love, you know,
it will just begin to spread.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.060
And it's

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.820
non-denominational, it doesn't-- you know,
it's everywhere.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:26.940
It's in the weirdest places,
it's in, you know, the

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.210
tiny little communities, because

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.840
it's everywhere.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.400
It's not fixed on any chosen people,

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.480
you know, as in the past.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.781
So it's going to wake up.

00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:46.140
You know, I always like that
one-liner that Jesus left behind him

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:50.680
where he said, 'When I return,
I will return like a thief in the night,'

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.580
you know, and I contemplated
that for many, many years,

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:57.806
and one day I just saw that and I was
like, 'Oh, wow, yeah. It's coming,

00:43:58.006 --> 00:44:01.420
you can't stop it, it's secret,
it's hidden, it's everywhere.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:04.780
It's a thief in the night,
it's just going to arrive.'

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:06.400
And it's this,

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.820
you know, 'new human'
that we're talking about.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:13.500
This is the new human
that we've both seen.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:16.000
And I think many people are

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.320
sensing,

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.620
here already among us,

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.500
in its potential, like you
mentioned the Buddhas and things.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:29.020
And one thing, probably that I loved more
than anything else in your book, Chris,

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:35.260
is when you describe the future human,
and I was left with this image

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:39.300
of all these Buddhas sitting down,
meditating and stuff,

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.460
and then this one human
standing in the middle of them,

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:45.660
standing on its own two feet,
and that was the future human.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.100
And
I thought-- you know, I feel like that's

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:52.566
such an enduring,
iconic symbol of what's coming.

00:44:52.766 --> 00:44:53.766
Because

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.460
we're no longer-- it's no longer
the journey of meditation and spiritual

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.940
awakening, and the spiritual journey
and this awakening through transformation

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.480
of the shadow,
suddenly that's come to an end,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.200
and suddenly that being is standing.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.880
You know, there's no practice anymore,
other than living.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.680
And then

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.600
that human

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.240
really begins a new humanity, because

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.073
there's no more awakening process.

00:45:22.273 --> 00:45:25.140
There are layers and layers of creative

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:29.620
expansion, always infinite
creative expansion.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:31.180
And there's playfulness.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.640
And there's

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.680
new layers of engagement

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.280
within the construct of reality.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.460
You know, all these levels and dimensions

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:47.860
and fields that we can explore, you know,

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.960
through

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.580
a new way.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:53.210
And what I really see

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:54.960
clearly is

00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.051
as that's-- as the age
of suffering comes to an end,

00:46:00.251 --> 00:46:03.600
you know, we have a new field,
and it's bliss.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.580
You know, we have learned enough

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:10.860
from suffering, now is our chance
and opportunity to learn from bliss,

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:14.640
because bliss
is the other side of suffering.

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.380
It's the same, it's almost the same thing.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:19.980
It's all that suffering leads to bliss.

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.620
And yet bliss is just the other

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:26.500
-- it's like the white hole to the black
hole, you know, it's like you go through

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.680
a black hole, you come out the other side,
there's this white hole

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:37.260
and it's-- and it has as much
depth and juice as suffering does.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.320
You know, so

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.380
there's a similarity to them

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:45.900
but it's a new muse that humanity has.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:49.740
So when we sit in that bliss,

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.980
and we move through that bliss,
we're moving through

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.980
the highest aspects of our consciousness,
and that then has to all be explored,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.460
all of it. Because bliss, like suffering,
has layer, upon layer, upon layer,

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:06.880
upon layer, upon layer and dimension,
and dimension, and dimension.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.380
And there's a whole epoch needed
again, just to explore bliss.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.480
So

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.400
that's why, in a way,

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.420
if you can hold that

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:21.960
in your heart and your mind
as we move through these very difficult

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.940
decades ahead, and
century-- centuries,

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:31.240
perhaps few centuries - I agree,
by the way, 21st century

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.500
is-- seems to be the one,
the next century,

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:38.800
you know, seems to be the one
- and, you know, remember that's us.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.380
You know, like, we'll be there.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.068
And I mean, you know, I say to people,
'You don't want to miss this.'

00:47:46.268 --> 00:47:47.460
You know, like,
people saying, like,

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:51.660
'This is my last incarnation.' Okay, well,
make sure you come back for that one,

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:55.840
because you don't want to do all
this and then not have the reward.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:56.500
We're in it.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:59.380
Yeah, so all things are
possible at that stage.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.820
And I think it's really good to bear these

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:07.335
things in mind as we're moving
through, you know,

00:48:07.535 --> 00:48:08.800
intense periods.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.400
Let's allow ourselves

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:18.440
to look deep into the future
of this future human.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.600
Because

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.260
whatever transformation we're going

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.420
through, and
we are going through, you know, we agree,

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:26.580
we're going through this
acute transformation.

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:31.180
We're giving birth to a new
order of human capacity.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.300
However long it takes
us to do it, you know,

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:36.120
a few hundred years,

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:37.960
whatever,

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.580
the human story is not stopping,

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:44.460
the evolutionary drama is not ending.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:47.940
This is simply going to be a new

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.000
platform

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.500
within which the human story
will continue to develop.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:56.760
I think you're right that
we have been evolving

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.187
out of through learning from suffering,

00:49:00.387 --> 00:49:04.160
that's been the great teacher
in much of our learning in the past.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.940
But I think-- and I think you're
right, we are getting past that.

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:12.240
We are growing out of that, just as we
are growing out of our fear of death.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.780
You know, if there were one thing that I

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:18.780
wish I could give people from my sessions,
it would be to lose the fear of death.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.700
Because if you're afraid of death,

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.460
you just have your whole
cosmology upside down.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:29.427
You just don't understand what's going on,
you know, death is graduation,

00:49:29.627 --> 00:49:33.840
death is the great respite,
death is the great reward.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:39.700
So we're coming into this period of deep
transformation, of living out of bliss,

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:43.420
living out of joy,
exploring out of bliss and joy.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:48.420
And I think you're right, it's going
to take us a long time to experience

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:53.260
the levels and levels of creativity
that can come out of that.

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:55.240
So the divine project

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.820
has brought us to this crisis.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:00.720
The evolutionary, natural,

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.500
however you want to envision,

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:06.660
the [inaudible] project has brought us
to this crisis is taking us through it.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.020
We're not doing it.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:12.580
I mean, this is much larger than you or I,
or any individual collection of people.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:16.180
Nature is driving us
through this metamorphosis.

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:20.640
Nature has just decided we're ready, we're
time, we're going through this thing.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.080
New platform, new beginning.

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.820
But it's not going to stop.

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:30.340
We're here for another million years.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.740
We're here for another billion years.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:36.180
So I think we should really look deeply at

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:39.820
understanding that we're
not only talking about

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:45.700
a kind of new humanity as we can imagine
it now, from our limited position -

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:48.580
we're talking about a new humanity beyond

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:53.620
our capacity to imagine,
because it is so different.

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.420
One of the things that happened

00:50:55.450 --> 00:51:01.280
at the very-- the last vision I was given,
the last session

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.460
is the session that I call 'diamond

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:11.680
vision', because in the session
I was given a ten-minute experience

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:18.860
of being able to see
1000 times more clearly, more precisely,

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:23.140
more exactly, with more discrimination
than I'd ever been able to see before.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:26.860
It wasn't a hallucination,
it was just absolutely--

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:31.080
I could not imagine that I had accepted

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:36.580
the dull experience of ordinary
vision as real vision.

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:39.800
And when it disappeared, I realised

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.500
I had been given an experience

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:46.720
of seeing the way the future human,
that all future humans, will see.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.820
This isn't just a transformation of our

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:54.380
heart and a transformation of our mind,
it's a transformation of our senses,

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:59.780
that our touch and taste
and vision and hearing

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:04.940
is going to be more and more refined,
more subtle, more exquisite.

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:09.980
The capacity of consciousness
to heal the body, to keep it on an even

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:16.460
keel, to transform it, the capacity
of consciousness to infuse and lift

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:21.920
the body into ecstatic
states of creativity, I mean

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.460
we're just getting started

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.740
into actualising some of the higher

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:32.300
potentials that are already
built into the human form,

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:37.140
but are being activated by this
evolutionary process, setting us on fire.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:42.960
And then the question becomes - well,
what might lie down the road?

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.380
And we could lose ourselves

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:49.380
in maybe projections and fantasies about
that, but the only thing that's really

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:54.660
important is to understand, I think,
the high stakes of what's involved here.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:58.740
We're not trying to simply
fix or heal humanity.

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:03.380
We are on the threshold
of birthing a different order

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.280
of human existence,

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.940
which is going to become the new platform

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:12.060
for yet still more higher
orders of human existence.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:17.210
This is a hugely significant
undertaking that we are about.

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:22.500
It's not simply trying to
rectify a short-term pass.

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.020
It's a cascading effect

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:27.660
into a very, very different future.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.139
It's a very high-stakes game,

00:53:30.339 --> 00:53:35.120
with very, very great rewards
that are coming in this time.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.860
If our nature is truly infinite,

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:43.140
as I think we agree it is,
if Brahman and-- Brahman is Atman,

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:47.180
the essence of the individual
is the essence of the Divine,

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.380
our nature is infinite,

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:54.500
then reincarnation gives us
an infinite amount of time

00:53:54.530 --> 00:54:00.020
in order to unfold, and to activate,
our infinite nature.

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.280
I think

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.340
if we qualify it carefully,

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:07.340
we are learning to be gods.

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:13.240
We are learning how to create on a scale
that we've never envisioned except

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.920
in our mythologies, or in our
science-fiction mythologies.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.420
So true, so true. And

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:27.520
one of the things that I have seen, and
my way of describing that mythology, is

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.180
you know, we are-- and I'm not the first

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:35.800
person to explore this, you know,
it's these different species or races

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.660
that are kind of evolving on our planet.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.160
And we've been through these before,
actually. You know, so-- and we're part of

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.680
a much deeper

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.210
epoch story than we realise.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.460
And we may have even
forgotten previous epochs.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.560
And

00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:00.000
because of the break in continuity between
epochs is so massive, you know, so--

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:07.040
but each time we go through one of these
portals, we include and transcend more

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.380
of, and we remember
more of what came before.

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.780
So I feel that's also potential,

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:19.100
that we remember more of what came before
as we move into what we're becoming.

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.160
And,

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.820
in a way, from my understanding,

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:30.556
is that this is almost like the final
stage or cresting of humanity's epoch.

00:55:30.756 --> 00:55:32.280
You know, because

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.254
it then moves into,

00:55:34.454 --> 00:55:39.300
you know, the culmination of this next -
since we're looking far, far, far, far

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:43.160
ahead - the culmination of
this next species

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.620
is our collective

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.660
harmony with the whole of Gaia.

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:54.040
It's coming into absolute
harmony with the entirety of Gaia.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:59.420
So taking our highest seat as
the consciousness of Gaia,

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:01.700
and as the gardeners of Gaia,

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:07.260
as the stewards of Gaia, you know, as
inseparable from the tiniest ant.

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.300
And, you know, like, everything
being part of our highest

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.620
capacity here, and the beauty of Gaia.

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:16.100
So we haven't yet seen - you know,

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:21.000
maybe at the very beginning
- we haven't yet seen Gaia, you know,

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.700
in her flowered-- flowering state,
fully flowering. You know,

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:29.340
with all her essences just released

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:33.980
in perfect harmony, and us
being able to move through the garden and

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:37.620
sup the nectars of everything here,
all of that.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:41.780
And each animal, and each creature,
and each having their place, you know,

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.200
within us,

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.900
because they have a place within us.

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.360
We are, you know, there is no

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.640
separation anymore.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.620
And so there's this incredible

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:56.700
crystallisation of the harmony of all
the architecture of life on Gaia.

00:56:56.730 --> 00:57:01.210
And my feeling is that this next
phase of our evolution

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:06.420
is about the weaving together of Gaia,
of all those creatures and things,

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:10.340
and understand-- so every
one of us has a specific

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:13.860
weaving role in that, to weave
back together

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:19.140
certain neurological pathways that are
unique to us, that only we could weave,

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:22.620
because only our creativity
wants to go there.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.100
So we follow our creativity and it weaves

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:29.060
together some aspect of Gaia.
And then all of us together doing

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:33.180
that creates this beautiful
tapestry of wholeness.

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:36.060
And the other aspect to this that I've

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:40.820
seen is as the process continues,
there's a timeline.

00:57:40.850 --> 00:57:42.380
It's very strange.

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:46.140
It's almost like a spiral,
the arc of time.

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:50.280
And as we get closer and closer towards
perfection,

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.820
the timeline closes in on itself

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:56.540
more and more and more, so in a way
time itself is being condensed.

00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:58.460
And when you get to that final

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.340
- this is a lovely joke
- when you get to that final

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:07.440
crystallisation point of perfection,
time itself dissolves.

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:12.960
So, in a way, my joke is that when
you finally get to heaven,

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.680
it stops.
Everything stops!

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.740
It's like it's finished. It would look
like from our vantage like, 'Well,

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:25.200
there's no time to enjoy it.' But
actually, there's infinite time.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:28.440
Infinite time, yeah.
So that's when humanity

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:32.640
finally transcends humanity. You know,

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:37.360
and then there's another one of those
epoch shifts, in which-- and, you know,

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.540
and it's beyond our comprehension.

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:42.360
You might even say

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:46.260
we then leave this sphere.

00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:50.820
Our consciousness then
moves to another sphere,

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:53.000
and Gaia is left

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:54.400
with-- you know,

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.500
she's not left alone, because
it's a chain, right.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:00.420
So now the animals start to kind

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:04.860
of crystallise, and their evolution
starts to continue and [inaudible].

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:06.780
So everything ratchets up.

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:10.860
And even the rocks and the minerals
are kind of moving up a layer.

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:16.184
Everything is interconnected, so
consciousness is embedded in everything,

00:59:16.384 --> 00:59:20.100
but it awakens in these layers,
in these contractions.

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:23.940
And then we move somewhere else,
somewhere, you know, somewhen else.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:26.260
We're beyond the time-space continuum,

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:31.120
that we've graduated from this
chain of evolution, this epoch.

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.660
You know, it's-- and then we
suddenly we're in this-- 'ah'.

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:37.060
We realise we're nested as part

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:42.700
of something far wider, because we've
remembered, 'Oh, we're galactic!'

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:45.978
Gaia was just, like, our playground,

00:59:46.178 --> 00:59:51.210
our-- that was another birth,
and then we're in a galactic

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:51.900
world.

00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:56.080
And so it goes on, and so it
goes on, and so it goes on,

00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.880
but that's-- You know, when
you go far, far, far ahead

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.800
and it, like, I know you've
been there, Chris, it's so--

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.160
the tapestries are so vast,

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.140
that-- but they're fractal, right?

01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.260
So they're repeated right down.

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:17.620
So when you look at-- you know,
it's like Blake saying,

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:22.040
you know, 'eternity in the-- in a grain
of sand, in a wild flower', you know,

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.180
it's like, it's in everything.

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:28.540
The same fractal patterning is
embedded in all-- at all levels.

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:30.320
So it's just

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.140
these waves of wider and wider
awakening and creativity.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.200
And

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.940
that's, you know, that's where we're

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:41.660
-- that's where we're going
and that's where we are.

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:45.500
And we never leave the present moment,
that's the beauty,

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:50.760
we never leave the freedom of the present
moment, even when we're in crisis.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.940
You know, and that's what's going
to become-- in a way,

01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:58.340
for me the most important thing
is that as the crisis comes,

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.260
we never leave the present moment and we

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:05.012
never forget where we're going.
You know, that this is all for a purpose.

01:01:05.212 --> 01:01:07.500
So that is the-- you know, when we have

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.820
to swallow the pill of suffering,
of intense suffering, that's the other

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:17.400
pill we take, the kind of-- the medicine
that reminds us that the suffering

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.060
is-- is it has Grace embedded in it.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.160
Yeah.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.860
I love hearing you go.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:28.740
When you go, you really go.

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:30.660
And I love because

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:34.720
I feel so deeply resonant
with what you're describing. That

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.180
this Earth,
this solar system is part of a galaxy,

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:43.540
which is part of a super
-cluster of galaxies.

01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:47.980
Time-space is part of a universe which is

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:53.080
part of a larger meta-universe,
which is part of another larger universe.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.540
We are going through this very, very
exciting, very important transformation.

01:01:58.570 --> 01:02:02.210
Humanity is going through this
tremendous transformation.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.180
And yet there are other species around

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:08.100
the galaxy going through
their own transformations.

01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:11.980
And so we don't have to deny any of that,
we can affirm all of that while also

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.460
paying tremendous attention
to what's taking place.

01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:17.820
How do we
take full advantage of the growth

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:21.180
opportunity that this time
in history is giving us right here?

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.240
Because

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.580
my understanding is we
choose our incarnations.

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:30.240
So that everyone who listens to this video

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.140
chose to be in history
right here, right now.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:38.140
They chose to be part of this traumatic

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:44.580
moment, this birth moment, this
ecstatic exploding moment in history.

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.860
They chose to be part of it.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:49.300
And they are exactly

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:57.240
where they chose to be in order to have
the greatest impact on positive outcome.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.740
It's not a matter of searching for
what should I do, or how do I respond?

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.180
Look under our feet.

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:05.940
We are already planted.

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:07.540
We have the talents.

01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:09.940
We have the relationships around us.

01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:12.460
We are already where we can do the most

01:03:12.490 --> 01:03:17.740
good if we're willing to take
responsibility and act, and really do it.

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:22.200
And that's what you're
talking about being centred

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.540
in your-- we know when we're centred
in our role in life,

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:29.980
we know when we're centred in our work,
even if we're suffering at that moment,

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:34.920
we have a deep confidence
that this is what we are to do.

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:40.660
There'll be so many distractions
being offered to us to not pay attention.

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:45.460
Distract ourselves with movies, distract
ourselves with this, that and the other.

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.320
It's-- and when things get hard,

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.400
it's going to be very
inviting to be elsewhere.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.780
But if we are really here,

01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:57.660
right here, right now, putting
all of our endeavour into this moment,

01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:04.500
that is the fastest way to move through
the harder part and into the joy,

01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:09.100
into the bliss, into the cooperation,
into the collaborations,

01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:15.060
into the opportunities for our individual
work, to be-- to meet with fellows

01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:19.780
on the journey and compound
into larger and larger projects.

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:23.460
We won't get there by allowing
ourselves to be distracted.

01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:29.860
We get there by complete commitment to our
circumstances, where we are as we are.

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:35.520
And I think you're right,
in that deep penetration of the present,

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.520
we get glimpses and touches and tingles

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.080
of the whole

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.420
structure, of the meta-universe,

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:48.540
which is also pouring its-- all
of its energy into the present.

01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:50.440
We meet heaven

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.260
only in the present.

01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:55.320
We meet the galactic superstructure

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.760
in the present, in this moment,
in this grand kind of collaboration

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.680
with destiny.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.100
So we wandered a long way from our early

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:09.520
talking about what's
the evidence for reincarnation.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.920
But

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:18.748
the communion with the universe is what
drives both of us, I think.

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:22.660
Deep communion, the opportunities
for deepening the communion,

01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:26.960
for letting go of all the things that get
in our way and going into

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:34.471
a deep sharing of the divine breath,
a deep communion of the divine joy.

01:05:34.671 --> 01:05:41.260
To really let it in as deeply as we can
possibly let it in, in the years that we

01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:46.760
have remaining, and then our next
incarnation, and our next incarnation.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.000
Beautiful, Chris.
Thank you.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.080
I don't think I could
add anything to that.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.210
I think we've-- I don't think there's
anything else needs to be said.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.460
Is there?

01:05:58.490 --> 01:06:02.900
Maybe not here and now, but certainly
in another time, in another place.

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:05.380
We'll wind it up again and we'll launch.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.500
I love our discussions.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.880
I love [inaudible] with you.

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:11.540
I love what happens when we get together.
Me too.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.920
And I think,

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.280
you know, our various
different communities will

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:21.100
hopefully come together, and explore
these things in new and creative ways.

01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:24.666
That's certainly, I think, my intention,

01:06:24.866 --> 01:06:26.080
to continue this

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.500
dialogue in all kinds of different ways
and to invite others

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:34.840
also into this dialogue,
to explore, to create, to come up with,

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.720
you know, proactive, creative

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.580
routes forwards in the world, depending,
you know, what is coming to us.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.116
And,

01:06:44.316 --> 01:06:48.240
you know, there's a lot of great

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.460
genius that's being drawn to these kinds
of discussions and these communities.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.560
And

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.800
when the genius comes together,
it's capable of so much.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.400
And I know that

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.720
many, many hearts are wanting
to come together and be of service,

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:09.140
as you said,
to be of the greatest service.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:09.426
So,

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:15.980
I think there will be opportunities for
lots of things in the times ahead.

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:18.180
So I want to really personally thank you

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.960
for being a great inspiration
to me, and for--

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.960
And likewise, really.
Confirming many of my deep held knowings.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.600
And kind of matching me along the journey.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.260
And, you know, and sometimes
just really pushing me a little bit

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:36.980
further as well,
so I really appreciate that.

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:40.340
Likewise, it works both ways.

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:42.500
Much love and blessings in your work.

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:46.460
And it's just a joy to spend
time with you, it truly is.

01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:53.060
It opens me up, invites me forward,
I receive much from our conversations.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:53.800
Likewise.
Absolutely.

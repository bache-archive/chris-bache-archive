      <p>welcome to connecting with coincidence with psychiatrist Bernard David biteman MD Dr biteman is the founder of The Coincidence project the project encourages people like you to tell each other coincidence stories to learn more about Dr biteman's work put connecting with coincidence in your web browser you'll find his book his Psychology today blog and the interviews from this podcast and now your host Bernard biteman MD welcome to connecting with coincidence I am Bernard biteman I'm a psychiatrist I study meaningful coincidences my book called meaningful coincidences how synchronicity and Serendipity happen uh is available at a link for those of you on YouTube below and uh we're talking about something that the psychiatrist doesn't address quite now but we got a problem here on Earth ladies and gentlemen uh and it tends to be denied people don't want to pay attention to it a lot of different ways of avoiding it and we are here to say the evidence is really strong we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction of Life on our planet a mass extinction is a short period of geological time in which a high percentage of biodiversity distinct species bacteria fungi plants mammals birds reptiles amphibians fish invertebrates and vertebrates like us die out and this definition it's important to note that in geological time a short period of time can be a thousands thousands or even millions of years the planter has experienced five previous Max extinctions the last one occurring uh 665.5 million years ago which wiped out the dinosaurs as everybody kind of remembers experts now believe we are in the midst of the sixth mass extinction and unlike previous mass extinctions caused by natural phenomena this sixth one is driven by us by human activity primarily the they're not limited to the unsustainable use of land water and energy use and the resulting climate change we have two very smart guys here who are coming at this question in different ways and uh it's the first time they're ever talking with each other but they got their hearts in common and their minds are really good as many of you know who know each one of these first is Chris Bates I'll introduce and then Dan Siegel Chris is a professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years key thing about Chris besides the living classroom was where I got introduced to him and the connections between minds of the students and his very remarkable that one and also Chris has the distinction of Taken has taken LSD I think 73 times and under control conditions high doses and explored not explored Consciousness and he's Come Away with some ideas about how to mitigate or what's going to happen with this mass extinction we are now facing Dan Siegel is a clinical professor of Psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine and founding director and founding the co-director of the mindfulness awareness Research Center at UCLA he is executive director of the mine site Institute which focuses on the development of mine site teaches Insight empathy and integration and his latest book just came out this month intra-connected is just about how this whole thing we are in is interconnected including you and I and me and them and you what we are they together kind of thing we are in this all of us and because each of these men come from somewhat different perspectives but again for me their hearts and mind have some overlap I've asked them to join me with a discussion about their views about what is coming for Humanity and what we might be able to do about that so we'll start off with each of each of them saying something about and their answer to this question and then the dialogue will begin between the two of them so Chris let's start with you and then we'll go to Dan oh I was hoping we were going to start with Dan first we can start with Dan first okay okay Dan thank you you're on uh okay well whatever I'm I'm happy to go with how whatever sequence um which probably relates in some ways to uh part of what I'll talk about but you know my background is trained as a scientist and then as a physician and then as a mental health practitioner uh as a psychiatrist um and then working as a researcher in the area of relationships and the development of the self and then becoming more an educator really teaching people in different Realms to the work of mental health of Education of parenting of policy and government organizational functioning things like that uh and then I worked uh starting around 30 years ago to bring different Sciences together into one framework that EO Wilson later would the term he used we would apply to that called consilience of finding the common ground and so initially it was all the different scientific disciplines everything from math and physics up to you know sociology and anthropology and everything in between but then it opened up at this field of interpersonal neurobiology to invite all ways of knowing so religious studies spiritual practices contemplative practices indigenous knowledge of looking at poetry at music and art dance um so you know any pursuit of exploration of Truth is invited into the conversation and you know we now have 80 textbooks in the Norton series that that I founded and um the the focus is on um reality but one aspect of reality we look at is the human mind and we see the mind as broader than the brain so unlike how Bernie you and I were trained uh in Psychiatry and in medicine since the time of Hippocrates 2500 years ago where the mind was thought of as a synonym basically for brain activity and William James the grandfather of modern psychology kind of reaffirmed that in 1890 um in interpersonal neurobiology we say Well that's true but not the whole story that the brain is really important but it's actually broader than the brain this thing called the mind and in fact it's bigger than the body so then in these last 30 years there's been a fascinating journey to look at what um the mind is from the perspective of what the proposal is is that it's an emergent property of energy flow that is a rising um both within the individual and in the relationality of the individual with you know other people and with nature so people on the planet and in that sense uh the mind has features such as subjective experience it has Consciousness it has information processing but a fourth facet of the mind is the emergent property that's been assessed by the mathematics of complex systems uh studied in the 1980s so pretty recently um it's the emergent property meaning the interaction of elements of a system give rise to something larger than the elements themselves um so we see all these properties as emergent but one of them this fourth property is the self-organizing emergent property of a complex system and we see it as the system being embodied and relational energy flow and this self-organizing process uh optimizes its uh its unfolding through a process of differentiating and linking and when optimal self-organization happens this what we'll call integration this balance of differentiation linkage it leads to a kind of flow that has five qualities that feel with the texture of Harmony and those are flexibility F adaptability a coherence which is holding together well over time C being energized with a sense of Vitality e and stable meaning reliable so this faces flow is a way you would describe basically optimal self-organization and the proposal from 30 years ago was that that was the basis of well-being and that when there's deviation from integration this integrative self-organizing process toward Harmony you get to either chaos or rigidity so in terms of the question of [Music] human life and individual's life you can look at for example attachment relationships and see that when they're integrative um the integrated sharing the honoring of differences and promoting of compassionate linkages within a parent-child relationship actually is a relational flow of energy and information that is integrated that stimulates the growth of integration of the child's nervous system and so in the textbook the developing mind I wrote now in its Third Edition you know there's repeated support in the empirical scientific literature that integration is the basis of well-being Smith and colleagues in 2015 show that every measure of well-being you could find is predicted by basically how interconnected something called the connectome is um and then in the similar vein in psychiatric disorders anyone with a mental suffering uh is can be revealed as chaos or rigidity and every study ever done of the brains of individuals with psychiatric disorders have impaired integration so that's that's interesting and then positive interventions like compassion training and mindfulness training those lead to increased growth and integration in the brain in in the very ways that studies for example of trauma show that integration is impaired in in children who are abused or neglected so all that being said integration then is seen as the the base of well-being so in terms of this question of what's happening on the planet the many pandemics we face I mean one is the pandemic of loss of biodiversity known as this this mass extinction but other pandemics include racism and social injustice the covid-19 virus even you can look at issues of polarization and misinformation the pandemic of loneliness and modern culture um and you know the addiction we have to screens and also just climate the climate disaster all of those are examples of chaos and rigidity and all of those I'll have you consider are either worsened by or even caused by and here's the proposal for our discussion that the the way the self is constructed by the human mind because of the vulnerabilities of the human brain we create in modern culture for a drive to certainty what we're going to name is the solo self a view of this Center of experience as existing only inside the individual and whether that individual is by themselves or in individuals like them so it's like a plural solo self um you can basically see that the heart of these pandemics um including Extinction you know might be this solo self and if that's true as you point out you know this condition of the extinction looks like it's due to what the human species is doing so the proposal in the book interconnected um and I can show you the the subtitle so you can kind of read it for yourself you know it's interconnected but it's the idea of an identity as mui me plus we as the integration of self identity and belonging so the idea there is that you can find a way to see how the self develops in the individual and in modern culture and that's what I do in the book through a lifespan examination of how self-defined as you know a center of experience that includes subjective experience perspective and agency you can remember that with the acronym Spa that this really scientific view of how the self-develops as separate and modern culture it's in fact with what the invitation is from contemplative practices from thousands of years and Indigenous wisdom from thousands of years so that here on this unseated land of the tongvan the Chumash in Southern California where I am you know the teachings were always about humans who are part of nature but in modern culture there's a drive to go from that verb-like fluid intra-connected meaning we're connected within a whole not just interconnected where I'm connected to you and that's the inter the between that's where the the word interconnected is useful we speak from the subjective experience perspective and agency of the whole w-h-o-l-e the whole of of reality and then in doing that then what you see is indigenous teachings have invited this contemplative practices have invited it um and and this discussion in the book is really just saying hand science join with those ancient invitations to see how the human mind's drive for certainty makes us view identity as an entity a noun-like thing rather than embracing uncertainty and opening to the verb-like reality of a more fluid identity and a belonging that is universal and then what the hope is and this is I think a realistic idealism in the sense that it's an optimistic view yes but it says Humanity can in fact construct a self that is interconnected as we and that can lead to actions for the greater good that are as if you had stubbed your own toe of your body you take care of your toe we would see the whole living world as who we are so that's that's in a nutshell that's the notion that's how it fits in with this discussion beautiful beautiful Chris comments questions and and you Dan that really was beautiful I mean that was beautifully summarized and I just really love the unfolding of layers and layers and layers of your research and the way you harness so many people's research to and bring that into into focus and uh I'm sitting here uh without any of the scientific background a difference and get that in a minute but it in total agreement with what you're saying just being over and over from my side of experience everything you're saying makes perfectly good sense the balance of integration of individual and larger Fields within which we are contextualized um the ways in which we push against the limits at those different times and where we're being pushed now uh I find it fascinating I'm I feel so completely aligned with what you're saying and yet I come to that with with a different with a different story coming to it uh not primarily a theory based story or a theory heavy story a research story but an ex purely an experiential Journey you know that my psychedelic journey is purely experiential so that it in different ways I experience the rupturing of that core self that you talk about and then the unfolding into a larger Dynamic field Consciousness repeatedly systematically and then experiencing that field Consciousness itself um dissolve like the small collectors have dissolved into yet another deeper level of field Consciousness where uh I so often wish that I that I had a PhD in physics and and astrology uh as astronomy to better understand assimilate many of the things that I was shown taken into but it was just a an educated Layman's dissolving into the my phenomenological sense was dissolving into fields of Consciousness within fields of consciousness and being uh acquiring insights are being given teachings about how those feels self-organize how they work I mean the living class in the classroom Bernie you mentioned that that book which was basically my attempt to understand the fields of Consciousness that we're connecting my students and my courses and me is there is kind of the spark plug within it and the ways in which my spiritual journey was impacting them through these mysterious channels of intercommunication that the field of Consciousness is that entire book was downloaded in 10 minutes in one session I had been pondering the riddle for a long time but it just came through cleared 10 minutes in one session and took years of course to open it up and to do the research for it uh and yet out of such a different different itinerary I mean I've been a professor of religious studies I teach a intro world religion courses Eastern religions Buddhism psychic religion transpersonal studies you know that that kind of stuff thank you outside of this modest academic frame the experiential Journey that I undertook starting in 79 going to 99. would lead me to such experiences that are in so much in harmony with what Dan what what you're describing Dan the your way of understanding the the larger patterns of organization that come up from underneath I don't know that I have much to offer in the way of ameliorating this pan this Extinction crisis that we've entered I have from these experiences a certain historical framework that has that I use that has been given to me to understand what's happening a certain uh conviction that we do make it through this crisis that it it doesn't end up becoming an Extinction event that we do make it through this crisis and again I I offer that purely on an experiential basis not on an academic basis not on a scientific basis but simply because in these deep States Of Consciousness time can be penetrated trans-temporal States Of Consciousness emerge in all the contemplative and spiritual traditions and they can be harnessed in a way and penetrated and sustained psychedelic practice so that part of my story is having experienced the crisis the death and rebirth crisis of humanity from the future not from the present going forward but that but also simultaneously from the future as something that has already happened and that doesn't make sense of course within linear time but within psychedelic worlds that becomes possible um it definitely becomes possible and it's understandable and the fluidity of time is becoming a a kind of a common discussion thing about uh precognition is uh one way to get into it Dan you were going to say something I think well I mean no I think it's beautiful Chris thank you and Bernie thanks for having us on you're welcome um you know to have this discussion I you know there's so much um richness in what you're talking about Chris and also um in in doing this consilience uh strategy that is where you really have an open mind about realizing there are many ways of knowing you know so that the teachings from indigenous cultures yeah some of whom use plant medicines you know um to open their Consciousness for thousands of years you know have insights into the way systems function that on one level sees the patterns and patterns of the patterns you know um that Gregory Bateson would talk about and in looking at these thousands of year old traditions one thing is fascinating is from independent cultures that never communicate with each other they came up with the same conclusions yeah uh so that's just fascinating the the second thing is that you have contemplative practices also thousands of years old that in their own independent ways have come up with the same exact conclusions the systems nature of our deep intra I would call it intra-connected nature and um so then you have to ask from a scientific point of view where you're always challenging your assumptions and challenging your hypotheses and doubting everything you know so it can sort of drive your little mad but it's a good practice and Adam Grant has a great book called think again about inviting you how to do that yeah but in science we do that and so from a scientific point of view we would say that wow you know indigenous wisdom is very much consilient with Systems Science and contemplative practices very much consilient with system science but then you realize that in much of what we do in modern culture and modern education there's linear thinking about a leads to B leads to C you focus deeply on the details and some of that is incredibly useful like there's a virus killing people let's look at its particular molecules let's make an antibody and let's make it so we can have RNA that matches it in some way and let's make a vaccine so now okay we have a vaccination based on RNA that we discovered because we were linear thinkers so we want we need to embrace linear thinking however yeah you know in there is another way to think in systems terms and you know this practice that uh that that called The Wheel of awareness where you take the concept of integration and take the the consilient concept that Consciousness is needed for change and then you bring those two consilient Notions integration is well-being Consciousness needed for change and then you integrate consciousness so I did this with my patients then I did it for my students and they were doing with their patients people started getting better so I started doing the workshops before the viral pandemic hit you know my my sister counted this up I did this with 50 000 people in person 50 000. and I would get the responses and you know what when they were in the basically you distinguish you differentiate the Hub of this metaphoric wheel as pure awareness there's the knowing of Consciousness like if I say hello you have both the hello and the knowing I said hello so we put the knowing in the hub we put the the known of in this case sound of hello on the rim and anyway people do the practice and you can do it for my website for free and yeah um and so when when we do this when people bend the spoke of attention that they're moving around the rim as part of the practice into the Hub the common statements are oh my God I'm connected in a way I've never felt connected my sense of a separate self dissolves time disappears you know love is there God I'm with the universe there's just this eternity and infinity you know this kind of thing over and over and over again even people you might say well it's a selected group of 50 000 people wanted to hear you so lucky I've had people dragged there who didn't even want to be there or people in I've done it at parliaments you know where people did not want to be at this workshop and they were forced by their government to do it or their spouses brought them and they had the same experience they could be never having meditated before or running monasteries and they have the same experience so what what you'll see in this book called aware or this book called Mind or this book interconnected is a question why is it on the rim people feel locked into time like a thought comes and goes or a memory is of a particular time in your life but in the hub it's timeless so I did a deep search I happen to be teaching with about 150 physicists at this meeting for a week so I asked them you know what's what's energy of course because I'm fascinated with that but what's time and you know this is a controversial thing to say anything in science is controversial you can say a and someone will say no it's B and you someone says no it's C so you have to be ready for that but for some of the physicists just to quote some of them there are two realms and this was on the cover of Scientific American in in July of 2018 the month before my book aware came out and I was so relieved because I thought people are going to think I'm nuts because aware was all about these two Realms but the fact is according to these physicists that I was with and subsequently reading a lot about that view and in Scientific American certainly said it in the large object world that Newton studied 350 years ago macro States large objects there's something called the second law of Thermodynamics and that law says that as things unfold they tend to fall into entropy fall toward Randomness they fall apart well that law only applies according to these physicists to the Newtonian macrostate world a hundred years ago the um capacity and Technology to study small things like electrons and photons led to the realization that the microstate realm didn't have that property of the second law of Thermodynamics and it's that awareness that things are moving with what's called an arrow of time we probably name as time so it has a feeling of linearity to in the Newtonian macrostate realm but just like you can walk on land and has certain properties you can jump into the water and you swim and it's different properties that's a different realm one reality two Realms water and land the same thing is true physicists tell us that there is a microstate realm where because the second law of Thermodynamics doesn't apply there is no error of time and there is no need in the equations that are super accurate about probability in the microstate realm there's no need for a t variable you don't have a time variable it's Timeless so I went to the physicist and I said if I draw it out like this does this work they go that's what it would be if you drew it out they hadn't drawn out but I drew it out so I said okay well then the Mind matches on to this for these 50 000 you know people that did it and those that responded it seems to match where pure awareness you're dropping into the quantum realm where it's time less and in that sense it's you know whether you talk about being able to go to the past future or present it becomes meaningless and self and other starts to shift because the experience in the quantum Realm is verb like unfoldings that are massively connected to one another the Nobel Prize was just given in 2022 for entanglement being proven meaning it's non-locality that in the quantum realm yeah you know there's there's uh the the the the experience in the Newtonian realm of separation and time and space doesn't exist there things are massively connected especially across space which doesn't have it doesn't impede relational connections so I say all that because you know I've been writing about this I've had neuroscientists chase me down hallways after a lecture I give saying stop talking like that stop talking like that I said what stop talking like what they said why would you talk about quantum physics and the mind I said well if the mind is an emerging property of energy and the physicists that study energy more than anyone else in the world tell us there are two Realms then I'm just saying it's a possibility that these Realms explain things like psychedelic use yeah that you drop out of the Newtonian thing so when people heard this they had me go to Newton's house in England where the original Apple Tree is there and we did the wheel of awareness around the apple tree they made a documentary film of it it's hilarious but we've paid our homage to a Newton because I say to people look when you leave this Workshop get in your Newtonian body get in your Newtonian car when you see a red light Crest on the Newtonian breaks and stop your car in time because if you don't you will become one with everything in the intersection there's a relativistic world where you're in a body and there's the universal as contemplative teachers like technology would say so this just is a scientific adding to the discussion and doesn't take the place of the saved there are these two Realms and listen when people do the wheel of awareness and are given the mystical experiences scale they get the same ratings as if they were on psilocybin yeah yeah okay Dan I love hearing you riff man I mean that's just beautiful everything you're that you're doing and putting together is just beautiful Rift is right that's a good word for it and he just he just he just needs a little music which his son could provide alexeagle.com I looked oh really exactly yeah his son's a musician now I'm gonna I'm gonna do it down to like uh somewhere between that traffic jam at the red light about to step on the Break um and bring us to Chris's classroom where I've really first got introduced to Chris and try there to talk about intra connection and experiences Chris had in that classroom which was my introduction to how uh another introduction how it's happening right now not just between two people or not a psychedelic out into the mystery but Chris would be somehow all doing his own riffing about something as a as teacher as teacher and people would come up to him the students would come up to him afterwards and say you have just answered a problem that I have been dealing with psychologically and how that began to be what I thought now is what you're talking about about intra connection that it's one it's one we there it's one mind of some kind in that classroom something in your terms Quantum begins to happen where Chris is intuitively subconsciously coming up with something students need without knowing that he's doing it yeah I uh it's one of the reasons one of the many reasons I'm so comfortable with what you're saying Dan because it it's so coherent with what my experience has been in the classroom an understanding of uh a growing understanding of the porosity of Mind of the um the feel nature of our individual Consciousness the feel nature of the of the collective Consciousness the way that individuals when they come together and focus their intention they create a field and that that classes develop Fields over over decades they get stronger and stronger the more more for genetic Fields the more students study this stuff around this particular teacher this field gets stronger and uh it became what happened for me is completely against my will and without my guidance I I started uh filling in blanks in my lecture it's just opportunities to explain some principle I was explaining with examples that just came out of my imagination and students started come up coming up to me and they say this is exactly what happened to me this week or this is exactly what happened to my mother and this kept happening over and over I thought well first I thought well okay chance you know okay but it kept happening so much and then over the course of time as my spiritual practice deepened which happened to be a psychedelic practice but it's irrelevant that it's psychedelicia it's really about spiritual practice it's my spiritual practice deepened this this access to my students mind deepened and began to zero in it seemed on places where they were hurt or where they were wounded or where they were held in Block until the next stage of their life and and working together or just being in the classroom with me while I was opening up to these very intense very large very pure states of awareness it just began to Cascade around me in in my classroom and so I developed what I call and I know it's just just metaphor I think talk about the atomistic the Newtonian approach to teaching and the atomistic which really is about individual cells communicating with individual cells transmitting across the distance versus what I call a Quantum teaching teaching within the reality of fields teaching with an awareness that my mind has an active influence in the minds of my students before the class even begins to meet and taking responsibility for this mind-to-mind Field Effect especially when you're dealing with a mind which is carrying the kind of energy that starts to flow in you from doing very intense spiritual practice in my case a psychedelic practice so I developed and I really um Juanita Brown's work in Cafe conversations were very helpful to me to how to catalyze and how to harness this Collective energy that is in the room and how to harness it in conversations and how to distill it in in written form um yeah I mean to me the and in the living classroom I don't talk about psychedelics at all the the back story is I was doing this psychedelic practice in private it began to impact my students this is how I worked it all out uh and one third of the book are student essays it's things that they they shared with me um and I didn't want psychedelics to get in the way of you know grammar school teachers High School teachers college teachers it's it's about the nature of Consciousness it's about the nature of mind it's about as you say Dan a Quantum understanding of mine a Quantum envisioning of the human potential and it doesn't negate at all the atomic truth does it you know the the reality of individual mind I know things that they don't they want things that I know in the exchange of stuff uh what I what I hear from what you're saying Chris and the classroom and I'm wondering about this with Dan and I get this experience at dance where it appears that uh your Consciousness Chris and certainly Daniel your Consciousness when you're with a patient because I know that as well you begin to form a little unit of togetherness that begins to be intra-connected that we we share some responsibility each of us who have some awareness of the awareness of being in this group mind with people and that what our thoughts do and our emotions do and what are the things that we end up might not be so conscious of can do is influence that field so there's a responsibility involved in our own thinking about what's going on here and perhaps what we want to have happen what do you think about that one yeah that's so beautiful and you know Chris it's uh it's great to hear this you know some people would use the phrase relational sensing or relational fields and with the metabol and Peter sangee uh and the group from MIT you know we're trying to figure out how to study those things in a classroom um so we we talk about generative social fields that that and we've picked out several teachers that seem to create exactly what you're talking about in a classroom we've then brought them together and then we ask them very directly what are you doing because everyone realizes when they walk in that room they can feel it and the teachers say the same thing they have no idea they they just do it so we we're making films of them and then we're going to study the films because they can't articulate it yeah break it down you know so so you know when when Michael Faraday came up with electromagnetic fields that you could not see with your eyes people thought he was nuts right but now all of our electronics are based on these invisible fields and my dear friend John O'Donoghue you know we used to teach together a lot and he would call himself a Mystic and the people came to study with him you know the mystics so I said John what's a Mystic he said it's someone who believes in the reality of the invisible you know and it's a beautiful way of describing it it really because it wasn't my background he was a you know Catholic priest and a Mystic and a poet and a philosopher but uh it wasn't my background and he didn't have a background in science but it really teaching with him over all those years really changed me because I realized the true scientific stance is to say you cannot see visibly everything that is real so even with the system stuff at MIT you know we're trying to say well what are relational Fields you know is it just the feeling you get as an individual from the way other individuals reacting or is there an actual field we don't have an answer to that but I think the the um experiences are fascinating and I was recently on a trip in the Grand Canyon and you know you go down the canyon and you're with rocks that were formed you know 1.8 billion years ago yeah so you get a whole different sense of you know the term geological time but with the humans that were on the trip you know some were saying you know how could it happen um that I get a communication from a relative like that's 10 000 miles away someone's six someone had an accident someone's dying whatever and I know it and then I find out later I knew it exactly when it was happening and I said well no one knows why but that kind of very specific thing might be explained by entanglement this idea of non-locality that if your minds are in a relationship with another person's mind basically if that's really a process of energy flow and since energy has these this Quantum property that's now been proven with the Nobel Prize you know that non-locality that is entanglement exists where Newtonian spatial separation doesn't really change the relationality of something yeah so it's not like what Einstein was worried that it was spooky action at a distance he called it but it isn't it it isn't that something's flowing from here to there so fast it's faster than the speed of light it's that there is no such thing as spatial separation so that's been proven now and it like in a linear Newtonian way you go that's not possible it's not possible well we have to drop out of the that way way of limited thinking so then then when you see and and I think Michael pollan's book had to change your mind on psychedelics you know the very last paragraph he says no one really knows how these work but maybe it has something to do with that Quantum stuff you know so I wrote to him and I said well here's an entire book on that Quantum stuff you know uh the book of called aware um and you know there's a beautiful book called you matter more than you think you know the quantum approach to social change and very carefully this was a Nobel Prize winner did this very carefully she um uh she really it's Karen Karen O'Brien is the author you know she very carefully says this may not be true but it might be true let's apply the the findings in quantum physics to social change and it relates to everything we're talking about of the sixth Extinction and what it does is it allows us you know and when I was around Newton's Apple Tree you could feel it it allows us to honor linear thinking in the macrostate world and realize you know stop the car to red light and all that stuff and at the same time what it does is it gives us a pathway as Joanna Macy says you know in in she uses the term the great turning meaning let's get away from the great unraveling of the sixth Extinction and let's turn the way humanity is so when she read the book interconnected she was saying you know this is the evolution and the revolution we need and she had always written about we need a Quantum change in Consciousness now what does that mean I think that means the linear solo self has had its day it's created business as usual which means you know if I'm in a body and this is all it is I better get as many toys as possible I better make as much money as possible but then when I get my toys and get my money I realize I don't really feel much meaning or happiness or anything so I better get more toys more money and now if I can build a factory I don't care the pollution it's going to create because I'm going to make so much stuff you're gonna want my stuff because I'm put out ads telling you you really need my stuff you buy my stuff I get your money you get this stuff and it isn't enough for you need to buy more stuff so I produce more Stuff Etc so let's call that business as usual and so we're destroying the planet with that because the fundamental notion of modern culture in that view is the solo self the self only exists in your body and this separation leads to so much unconscious angst and and despair that it's driven to a materialistic acquisition approach to meaning and life which is totally unsatisfying and becomes a kind of an addiction to things that completely make you feel unsatisfied but you keep that path so yeah the notion that we could actually have this Quantum change Quantum would mean yeah a big change but literally from a scientific point of view it means getting out of the Newtonian illusion of a separate self which unfortunately in modern culture we're going to name could be actually a lethal lie so this becomes more than oh Chris your explorations of you know what matters in your own LSD Journeys or for Michael Pollan who was new to it you know to say look all these things basically get you in touch with love and that's one of the most common things people say in the hub of the wheel so I was teaching in a parliament once and they were having all sorts of tensions so they had me do a day-long workshop with the parliamentarians and you know we did the wheel of awareness and during the break um everyone's having snacks and one of the parliamentarians comes over and he goes Dan you know I didn't share during the sharing time I said yeah I noticed he goes do you want to know why I didn't share I said sure why didn't you share he goes do you know that part of the wheel practice when you bend the spoke around into the Hub I say yeah I know that part and he goes and he slows down his eyes get filled with tears and he goes I have never felt so much love before in my life I've never felt so connected to to everyone and everything there's the silence and I said so you didn't want to share that and he goes oh no no no he goes if I said love they and he points over to his parliamentarian colleagues he said they would think I was weak so there's a silence we're just kind of staring each other's eyes are all welled up with tears and I said I get it you didn't want to Pure weak it was no no I said so can I ask you a question you go sure I said so when you're making federal law when you're making National policies are you leaving love out of the reasoning and then his eyes get really really big and he goes and he runs over to them right now this is a guy who never meditated before in his life I'm you know this experience was new for him obviously from what he was saying but you can only imagine that this not being in touch with this core aspect which feels like it's a threat of the tapestry of reality that love is this vital force that if people in positions of power like a parliamentarian in a country you know think love is weak you know then we're in trouble you know we're in deep trouble so the idea then of you know in this case it's the wheel of awareness but even just the concept that you know we can actually tap into this deeper source of awareness that has love at its core I'm very hopeful that we can actually turn this around in time I know we have a very brief window of time probably less than a decade and so there's an urgency to this but while there's an urgency to it it's an ancient message that somehow modern culture has ignored so my deepest hope is that adding a little bit of the science to say Hey you know this is the problem and maybe as a physician I say look if someone comes in to me and has pain in the bottom of their foot and they're limping and I go what's going on they go I don't know I have a pain in the butt of my food I'm limping I say here come come here let me take off your shoe let me take off your sock let me look at the soul of your feet and let me oh whoa whoa whoa there's a splinter will you let me take the splinter out oh this is Hunter yeah take the splinter out and now they walk straight their back isn't hurting anymore the pain is gone we have a splinter in modern culture in the soul of society that is the separate self and my deepest hope is that this conversation about interconnectedness and we you know this meat plus we is you don't have to get rid of the individual you don't have to you don't have to crash into traffic intersection you could say I have an individual body that's good that's a me and we added we integrated with we and you make them we word or how are we going to say that in different languages and then we as a way to liberate you from the LIE of the separate self and allows us to actually find a new way to go to the great turning this movement of Joanna Macy would say is away from the great unraveling and can let us to go away from business as usual and I think everyone's gonna be better for it yeah yeah and the country state that beautifully Dan just so beautifully absolutely beautifully the contribution of awareness of meaningful coincidences is that the primary kind of meaningful coincidences mind thinking of something imagining something it happens in the environment and it begins to show us an individual daily life that mind and environment are connected that we are not separate from each other we are not separate from our surroundings being able to like sing a song which I was singing along a river yeah the other day and uh I like 50 songs and I was hitting like a low note 10 10 or low note and right then I hear a harmonic very much like the note I am singing and I said hey it's joining me in this song and it was it turned out to be a truck going across the river the river I was nearby but the experience of having the external join what appeared to be the internal is the sort of thing that for some of us is a slow but persistent daily reminder of mind being connected with environment the basic message of which is we have to dissolve our Reliance on the belief of a separate self and then what do we have left and so the message from from you Dan particularly and I think Chris too is how do we help people recognize their inter and intra-connectedness so they can find the love that's all around us there's love all around but I never heard it singing no I mean there's a love all there and it's so much fun to be in it and all its many variations one of the troubles I've been having is there's so many different kinds of love that we can experience as a gradient of them and it's fun to try to do various of them so being able to get out there and connect then would you would you separate out for this listener hear me interconnected versus intra-connected sure well the the origin of that word uh I you know I was working with these system scientists at MIT and we um we went on a retreat together to deepen our experiential sense of of systems so we were up in the Colorado mountains with John P Milton at the way of Nature and part of that Retreat process is to go for three days um by your individual selves in the forest so you know we had our experience and we came out after the three days and we're together and everyone was saying these beautiful experiences they had of being interconnected with the forest and being interlaced with the forest interwoven they use tick not Hans beautiful term inter being and then it came time for me in the circle to speak and I'm I'm kind of a particular person for the meaning of words and I said you know I resonate with everything you're saying everybody but the experience for this body was not so much a betweenness it was like within this I mean I was the creek I was the tree I was the sky I was the body called Dan there was a within this to it I I I I don't know I couldn't say interconnected because there wasn't a separation of me connected to that so I guess I would say interconnected and everyone's like nodding fine fine we went back to the you know the place we were staying and back to technology I turned on my computer I want to take some notes on the three-day experience and I kept on writing well you know I was interconnected and the word processor autocorrect kept on changing it back to interconnected so I said what's wrong with my computer and then I looked it up there is no such word as intra connected you know connectedness of within and and so I just had the feeling that you know if we don't have a word to speak from the perspective and and speak on behalf of in terms of agency or even the subjective feeling of the whole then we've got a problem in at least in English but it turns out there really isn't a word like that in many other languages um so so then I thought you know I need to write some kind of appeal to our human family that modern culture at least in in the way we experience it now you know has created this experience where the self is only separate so that would be interconnected interconnected means you know the three of us are here and there's connections between us that's the inter and there's connections and that's beautiful too so it's it's better to have interconnection than no connection but we need to take it one step further to realize we can speak on behalf of the experience of the whole a whole forest and whatever life what I get from just your Rift there is I like going from intra to inter I like the connection and the separate it's all I'm part of it it's part of me and then I get to experience myself as somewhat separate but still connected exactly and that's exactly Bernie the idea of integration is you have a me in a body and no one is saying get rid of it and then you have a we in a relationality so there's an inner and an enter and when you put the inner and the inter together it's the intra right so so that's a way of just wording it and what was fun about writing the book is you know to take the reader on a kind of journey together looking at lifespan development so look at the science of self and how it develops you know in utero in in infancy in toddlerhood and in the early years of school and Adolescence and adulthood what's the resistance to change and really trying to review not in an academic way but just in a useful way like what is practical about what science has said so it's like a synthesis of a whole bunch of Science in a very short way to say here's what happens across the lifespan in modern culture to actually be developing the false view of a noun-like separate self-entity and then here are the opportunities to actually open that up not getting rid of the individual but realizing you are inner you are enter and you are the wholeness of it all the intra yeah Chris uh just beautiful again this has been of course the the ancient message of the spiritual traditions and now the scientific voice you're saying is joining that chorus with its own particular epistemology but the core message is the finite self is a limit itself it's not an ultimate self it's a functional self the contextual self or as the Buddha saw in his night of Awakening he awoken and saw a self not anywhere in the world not in him not in anyone else and in anything else and one when one enters this deeply into transparency as you say interconnected is just too small for it interconnected it's it's a wholeness of life where the the beginning and ending of my life dissolves completely in the beginning and ending of all other lives and one lost and are not lost are dissolved into the the communion of life in its totality functioning in its beautiful individuality and yet EX incredibly complex and balanced Harmony in community to experience that if we can stabilize that experience if we can tap into that experience and generalize that experience and make it part of our living culture then we really have a foundation for a very different culture on this planet and I I it's so encouraged by your description Dan and I also think that this is happening at a kind of a another level where I think all of our farmer lives which live within us into various ways just we carry the history of the planet in our soul we've been every race we've been every religion but every variation and as a planet is coming into this cataclysmic process of compression uh we are psychically coming into this inner process of compression and I think that this uh transition into a Quantum sense of self a Quantum a sense of wholeness a quantum entanglement and and I love that that word from you know Dean Raiden in his book and entangled mind um I think we're coming into a compression point in history where it's just like Extinction is an evolutionary driver and it's a very powerful I think you're right that the ego yeah this is a civilization a culture that's been built on the the ego and which is a beautiful structure but it's it's a it's an imprisoned self and it leads it builds a divided world and we don't have the luxury of a planet any longer being Guided by an egoic civilization even a well-intentioned egoic civilization we need to give birth to a higher more inclusive form of human identity which I I think this inclusiveness that you're pointing to Dan also correlates with an escalated intensity of a center integration so that what I call the diamond Soul isn't is a summation individuality but it also is because its very nature it's also a transparent individuality it's open to the field it lives in constant uh feedback with the field uh it's I don't have any the faster we move through this crisis the better the more we all begin to understand what's happening and align ourselves with becoming the kind of being that history needs us to be at all those levels uh then the fewer children have to die the fewer grandchildren will have to die I guess I I see this price of this crisis deepening for decades not on the basis of psychedelic Visionary not not at all but just in terms of what the environmentalists are telling us and the crisis that they seem kind of coming at us uh but I do think I do think it is about releasing something Splendid in the human heart it's about actualizing our divine potential in a higher order a higher register same Divine being same Cosmic nature but actualized into a higher self-expression and I just I'm suing I take such strength in your description Dan it's really uh I feel such deep resonance with it yeah it's a real well good I thought you might Chris I thought you might and you have uh and you do and I I'm just uh like looking at my next dance step you know I kind of I I mean I can be fairly academic I've done it that a long time but the next dance step I see is somehow being able to facilitate not only the recognition but the experience of the self as being part of something greater it's not just this me it's uh to me and it's me with others it's me with nature it's me with this whole planet it's with me with Gaia I am part of it and you are part of it and we are all part of it and have that experience and I like the differentiations that come out with doing that that there's some there's there's there's there's there's centers of intra-connectedness a family is a center of a of a mind that of which each person is a part for example or a group and again it dances where I get to experience that sometime so what where as we come to the end of this I I really well do you guys like it or not I don't see this as just the end of anything here I think it's a beginning here we've got and it's been going on for a while anyway but here we are the three of us talking about this and we've got to dissolve the self at least temporarily to be able to like uh modulate that it's just me thing which is defensive right now I mean people are doing it now being scared there's a lot of reasons to do that I and you've described very well I don't have to try to do that but our mission each of us in our own way I think is to be able to help that singular singular identity of self is separate from everything else begin to have an oscillation between self and environment and I think that's what we're doing I think that's a a mission we're all on in some way or other in our own ways with our own songs and with our own dance and our own people our own way of doing it and each of you have uh that as what you're doing and I I'm so glad that we've been able to at least get a touch of it so I I thank each of you for for joining me in this discussion clarifying something I kind of knew but making it clear for people who are listening to us that this singular ego thing has to be replaced with something a little more broad but still the integration is part of the vacillation so I'm gonna we'll end this with each of you having some closing comment and um then we'll we'll stop so Dan oh it's beautiful to be here with You Chris and and Bernie as you know it's it's um it's a moment in our human evolution when I think if we realize that a process that is really established called cultural Evolution yeah it's very real and everyone can have uh participation in something called pervasive leadership where every individual can take whatever role fits with your life to find a way to sense into a self that yes is inside that's the inner yes that's connected other people and to Nature yes but that also besides inner and Inter is intra and this is the me plus we is we you know term and what what I invite everyone listening to just consider is that cultural Evolution happens by one person one relationship one conversation at a time people often quote Margaret Mead the Anthropologist is saying you know don't ever think that a small group of people can't change the world because indeed that's the only thing that ever has so if we can just have that pervasive leadership now you know with the grounding in indigenous wisdom and contemplative teachings from thousands of years and with the additional you know supportive modern views from science you know we actually can take the steps we need in the time we can do it so the issue is not whether we can or can't because we can't this cultural Evolution can happen very rapidly the bigger question is will we and we will because we have to well that's I'm with you that's a big driver as a Big Driver keep those grandchildren around uh being able to do their thing that's because we're part of trying to make that happen uh Chris but Dan I would just underscore everything you just said and put my initials right beside it because I certainly believe everything you've said uh one of the things that was shown me along the way was um you talked about feels and Quantum fields and and part of my experience was at one point that the intensity of the global crisis we're coming into is going to hyper stimulate our individual Fields but the collective field of humanity yes so it's going to drive it into non-linear conditions we know something about how physical Fields behave in non-linear conditions Chaos Theory now if we make the assumption that the psychic field of humanity under non-linear behavior is far from equilibrium conditions will have some of those same qualities then we have a way of looking at emergence coming out of the depths of the human psyche knew the emergence of new forms crystallizations of that weren't even available previously but represent an actualization of latent capacities within human nature so that feels deeply aligned with what you're talking about and it helps us understand how we can make as big a change as we need to make in as short a time as we have because in in the instability of of a of a when we come to trick trigger points bifurcation systems of course very susceptible to small perturbations so that the influence of individuals increases the more we move into a period of Crisis that gives added weight to each one of our effects on the outcome and uh yeah that's and I just I just really support what you're saying yeah that's really good really good so hopefully those listening to this and watching us will be part of uh joining us and trying to be able to facilitate the intra connection that's also interconnected and also about us individually so thank you both for joining me today it's been a great discussion thank you Bernie thank you for getting us together thank you Bernie thank you Chris it's great to be with you all and this is a it's an exciting moment and we can do this yes [Music] like a hologram you've got me consciousness [Music]</p>

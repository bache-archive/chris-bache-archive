      <p>[Music] [Music] hello everyone welcome to adventures through the mind i'm your host as always james w gesso this podcast explores topics relevant and related to psychedelic culture medicine and research and i'm going to start this one off with a question have you ever wondered what 76 high-dose lsd sessions over the course of 20 years might teach a person about how to make sense spiritually of a global crisis and perhaps the collapse of civilization as we know it well if you wondered about that you're in luck for this episode because that's exactly what we're going to talk about we're talking with christopher baiche the author of this book lsd and the mind of the universe christopher m bash is a professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at youngstown state university where he has taught for 33 years a fellow at the institute of noetic sciences he is also adjunct faculty at the california institute of integral studies and on the advisory board for graf transpersonal training in the graf foundation an award-winning teacher and international speaker he is the author of three books and he's been on the show previously oh i forgot to get the number of that episode one second episode 89 mapping consciousness with high-dose lsd where we talked about essentially what this was all about his his 70 excuse me 73 high-dose lsd journeys over 20 years and what he experienced and what he learned about the nature of reality and the nature of the universe throughout the course of it now this is sort of a follow-up from that from that interview and it was intended to be as you'll hear in the beginning a discussion of various different themes of the book but pretty quickly it focused on a particular aspect of the book which is that while chris was having experiences of deep time which is sort of like you can imagine experiencing the entire course of the human existence as a singular moment or the entire entirety of time and space as a singular thing for example although he does a better job explaining it he had a vision at one point of what he called the birth of the future human in it coming out of basically extreme cataclysm in some sense or another a long phase of extreme strife and grief and suffering and challenges that pushes humanity into its next phase of evolution and chris considers where we're at now to sort of be the start of that so what initially was going to be me just taking quotes out of this incredible book turned out to be a discussion with uh with chris about the crazy situation we seem to be in as a planet right now and what from his perspective is a is the sort of spiritual meaning of it or how we might approach it spiritually um and yeah so that's what we talk about now this interview was actually recorded in september of 2020. i'm not entirely sure why it took me so long you know what i'll tell you why it took me so long to get it out is because i was in the interview i actually was going through a difficult time and at some point it became less of an interview and more of a young man pleading to an older man for some sort of wisdom to make sense of crisis make sense of the challenges personally and existentially that i felt like i was facing in the moment and still kind of feel like i'm facing and maybe i was a little embarrassed about that i don't know but either way now is the time that it's coming out and some of you might seem to see some similarities in some of the topics to some recent controversies in the five meow dmt world but none of this is a response to that this is was actually recorded what is it now april so like more than six more than six months ago um so yeah that's for context it's happening this was recorded september 2020. um another point of process about it is that uh chris's sound is not always super great there's some banging some knocking in the background did my best to clean it up removed a lot of stuff that you won't hear um but bear with it a little bit in fact there's one point where he's saying something super meaningful and it is like some loud thing comes in the background that's so distracting at this moment that feels like just such a like a pinnacle of like the value of what he's offering it just like it's just an interesting sort of like reality dance moment um but anyway so that's those are those are the caveats um and that's uh that's the interview we got today with christopher beige before we get into it i want to give a big thanks to my patrons on patreon without whom this podcast

to the end i got a special announcement um but here we go but uh here we go this is my interview my second interview with christopher baiche here on adventures through the mind enjoy uh so chris i i had been i had been going through i have been going through like the extensive amount of notes i have like i listened to our first podcast again and i went back through the notes i took uh when i was in your workshop in vancouver and also was going through the book and i just i kept wondering to myself like what what's the course here i felt like in our first in our first interview i had the ability to to have listened to your talks and had paid attention to the way that you structure your lectures and then sort of utilize that as le as the as the sort of like as the path to walk having a sense of how you start what you talk about and where you go and then sort of use that as a way and i didn't have that this time and so and if you're okay with it i thought what might be interesting because i have your book here and as you can see i've had i've had quite a time with your book yeah author loves to see it yeah it's great yeah i moved i moved on to little tabs because i was like well you know what as much as as much as most like authors are like oh yeah write in it fold up the pages whatever works i just kind of grew out of wanting to just destroy the paper that holds the book yeah yeah so i thought maybe it would be fun if you're open to it that i would just go into some of the things that i've felt really moved by or relevant in your book read the piece and then be like what is this and have you sort of like speak to that would that feel cool for you sure that's fine that's great and i'll tell you too that um now that came out books out first round of interviews and all that stuff kavkovic hit stepping back digesting people's first reactions i uh i don't think i sent you a copy of an article that i just sent to psymednet and you know in england basically i'm calling it a postscript to lsd in the mind of the universe it's uh of responding to people's first takes on the book first round of experiences but in that process i'm finding that there is a whole another tier of the implications of these potentials which i just feel like i'm beginning to want to get into it's like nothing new and at the same time the sheer the sheer audacity of the claims concerning the limits uh and the revised limits of human experience what we're capable of and the import of entering such deep intimacy with the consciousness of the universe it's all just sinking into me at a new level so that's a cons it's a conversation i'm really glad to be doing this second bite of the apple something different and there's been a whole lot of first interviews and i'm glad to see i'm glad to spend this time with you and happy to see where we go cool is that is that something that you feel because i'm i'm i'm ready and willing to adapt is that something that you feel like you'd like to get into or is it something where if i pick a section of the book it can work as a reference point even for your sort of like the second tier of your considerations on the impact of the book yeah uh let's do it i trust it'll if it'll come up where it's relevant in our discussion uh yeah because it it floats in the back and it's not like a specific set of themes it's it's uh [Applause] portly partly it's the enormity of the vision of history that's involved and it seems like we're getting into that episode a period of history faster than i thought we were going to be getting into it and partly it's simply the sheer scale of the of the undertaking but it'll come up when as it comes up it'll flow as it comes up in our discussion i trust our discussion well i mean i think it's right here right now because this is something that definitely came up for me as i was reading near the end of the book because i i read it i read it this year i read it during the 2020 pandemic lockdown you know it was one of the things i i was i was immersing myself in while i was locked away from the world really no different than i would have been otherwise except i didn't have social events to unfurl into you know at the end of the day and on the weekends um oh not to mention all the existential uh you know like gravity of it all um but one of the things is you you get to a point where you you you're talking about this sort of like this i'm not using your terminology here or maybe i accidentally am because i forget what it was but something about like basically being this rock tumbler and that this this future human is going to emerge out of like deep strife and struggle and pain and you know these sort of like this look at at what will become history as being an event not too similar something anagolous anagolous to the cleansing process of your psychedelic explorations and strictly so yeah and so as i was reading it i was like i kind of feel like i kind of feel like on one level i'd be i might be foolish to think we're already there despite how bad this is this is nothing you know this is ultimately just a virus right and it's just yeah yeah but but how do you feel about it i think of it as an overture it contains some of the key elements of the symphony that's coming but only in short abbreviated forms it's mobilizing us i think what's coming is going to be much much worse but if we learn this has sort of disoriented us a lot and it's given us a lot of lessons and hopefully it's giving us learnings teachings that will help us in what comes next uh but you're right this is just this is just act one it's just an overture yeah a stress test is how i heard it described early on like this this is a stress of course it's it has evolved well and beyond just the pandemic we have sort of the total dissolution of what was once thought of as of objective reality due to the impact of multiple what i i have heard described as multi-level narrative warfare and the destruction of deep considerate or coherent thinking and dialogue because of social media and how the news and then the you know all the populism and nationalism and also the yeah the big pushback against these types of things as well especially black lives matter and stuff like that um yeah but and at the same time it's like this really is not nearly as bad as it could get or maybe will get yeah yeah i think so i think you're right in fact let me grab a book to bring it up here to beale because i'm probably going to want to mention it somewhere in this process and i'd like to have the cover to show you sure this is a book i went to get dwayne elgin's last book uh choosing earth it's a lifetime literally a lifetime of research going into it and he gives he has a uh he's a social activist in a very detailed decade by decade what he thinks is coming and he he really marshals he's been tracking the large scientific data global health of the planet people for a long time and he has a he really lays out a time of increasingly tight collapse over the next several decades he really thinks by 2050 we're going to be more than halfway into the great collapse so i just want to bring it in to mention it when it comes up yeah that's um so then what's coming up for me right now is it is this question of of and i've heard listeners you know if yes if they're hearing and getting your work for the first if this is their first encounter with you this might be all of a sudden like whoa how are we already in the deep end here um but this is very much a continuing conversation between you and i and then also with your work yeah um yeah i i notice what comes up for me is this this this you know the immediate like what do we do what do i do kind of like that sort of quick to problem solve fix action now forward rather than how did we get here what does this mean how did we how do we come to understand what's happening prior to even coming to understand what an action-based solution is and i'm curious for you where where you see that process of coming to understand where we are is um yeah something akin to you know you're mentioning about you know something about a lot of lessons here what do you think these lessons are what are we learning and in fact perhaps what does it appear from where you're sitting that we're not learning out of all of this yeah well i don't i have to be careful i'm not on the front line i i have only second hand information from the news accounts as i watch people react and respond uh we're learning a number of things one of them is we're learning the fragility of our of our system uh we're learning our interconnectedness how systems that have functioned quietly side by side seemingly independently they're not independent at all they're quite interdependent we're learning a lot about supply chains and and how our where our resources come from and um we're learning that that people who have very modest jobs from some socioeconomic viewpoint have very important jobs when it comes to maintaining the health and well-being of our of our collective so i think we're learning interdependence we're learning um our entire life can be turned upside down much faster than we thought it could we we don't have as nearly as much stability as we think we do um i i think we're learning something about um the limits of patriarchal ego and i think trump is the embodiment i hope of the last gasp of the patriarchal monarchy we're learning how ugly ego is just how really really ugly it is uh and we're learning a lot about um where to go and where not to go when we come into crisis this polarization is taking place the resort of violence uh how quickly we move to violence and it's like we take almost any issue no matter how trivial like mass and turn it into an issue which leads to people killing each other i mean it's just the mirror what we're seeing in the mirror is not very complimentary it's pretty ugly the way i sort of see the larger landscape of course is that [Applause] um in so many ways it's ego that built our culture uh and by that i mean simply it's a human being at a level of spiritual development which identifies with their body has a certain level of self-awareness but that self-awareness stops pretty close to the edge of their fingers and toes and they still are looking out rationally looking out for their well-being and the well-being of a small number of people near them and around them who basically look like them or related to them in some fundamental way ego is a magnificent thing a beautiful thing an important thing but a world built by a species that's operating out of egoic awareness is a divided world it's a world of haves and have-nots and we can't get more extreme in the presentation to ourselves than the halves and half knots in duane's book i came across the statistic that five people own as much of the world's resources as half of the world five people have half of the world's resources you just can't have that big a disparity of halves and half knots and it's just being this illness is just blasting this into our faces who's suffering the most and who's suffering the most and the poor and persons of color so a lot going on uh but this is just warm up this is just the the first wave i think i think maybe the first wave might have been actually the credit crisis of 2008 because that taught us some things and it also sucked a lot of liquidity out of the system we have much less much fewer financial resources to fight with than we did before and now this is getting deeper you know national debt increases but certainly we are if not in the first round we certainly are in a significant second round i mean for for listeners again who don't know like it wouldn't appear as though this conversation is couched in your 20-year journey your your your 40-year journey as a as a philosophy professor and a 20-year journey with high-dose lsd sessions um and the book that we're we were referring to earlier is your book on those journeys as well as a number of other books and i'm just curious because what i'm seeing in the world um which is mostly the world that is mediated by a screen at this point um is not the kind of place i really want to be uh both in i don't both in the sense of i don't want to be where it appears we're going i don't want to be a part of a system that does the things that it does you know like the i don't i don't like the fact that i'm a part of this disgusting distorted thing and also what i see from the behavior of the people around me and there's a lot to be said about how social media algorithms and and isolation and mental health crises acknowledged or not are contributing to this but i see a lot of toxic behavior a lot of toxic people a lot of toxic discussion sort of like draped in this sort of like uh this sort of self-confident self-righteous almost machiavellian style like moralism of like the good versus the evil and the good is me and anyone that disagrees is like the violent devil i must cast out and and whatever else and i don't feel good about what i'm seeing about the world and it makes me want to just like hide away inside now yeah that said coaching this in psychedelics and looking at it as as a large psychedelic amusing air quotes for listeners process that's happening collectively on a global scale not just with humanity but we're although we don't know what the feelings and the thoughts or perspectives are the birds and the salamanders and the and the whales and and whatever you know they're going through that with us so it's like a planet it's like a planetary experience right yeah that when i see these parts of myself in a psychedelic session it's no more comfortable by any means it's equally as ugly yeah you know and i want to hide away from that too and get one of the things you talk about in your book is that you we need to learn as a part of the psychedelic journey we need to learn how to not turn away from our pain or from that pain i mean like the pain of touching a hot fire we turn away from but this kind of pain that we learn to turn towards it and i'm wondering if you could just that's not a clear question but can you just comment yeah yeah yeah you know the starting point of serious psychedelic work is taking complete responsibility for one's own shadow and uh and you just go into a room close the door lock the door you're inside by yourself nothing there but you in your mind and you go into the parts of your being which are at least initially the most daunting the most intimidating the most frightening the ugliest ones we like to acknowledge the least uh you know and but the commitment is there to take that on to enter into it uh when we see that ugliness being manifested in the world around us by people who are not have not yet taken responsibility for themselves and they they are still in this exterior mode where the the shadow was really outside of them the evil and the darkness and the really ugly things were outside of them um that's a very different world isn't it and i think this whole process of breaking down this breaking down process that we're going into is basically going to be breaking down that defense that we have to thinking that you know we're the good guys or and the other people are the bad guys and eventually we're going to have to come to terms with the fact that we're we did this we created this imbalance we have benefited from it we are continuing to generate it in the cars we drive and the lives we live and the lifestyles we aspire to we have done this we will we have done it there's going to come a time eventually where there's no place else to look but we have to take individual and collective responsibility for the pain that is that is alive within us and lives of everyone around us that really is a pivot point i think when we just stop blaming the other stop blaming previous generations stop so on and so forth we really settle in we're not there yet some of us are there yet i mean i think the psychedelic community understands these things because that's how you make progress in psychedelic work is you confront the shadow now when you go into the work you know that uh the more you purify the more you cleanse the deeper the reward the deeper the ecstasy the deeper the teaching so the more you purify the deeper the communion once you learn that not only do you become more comfortable facing the shadow but you actually actively embrace the shadow you active actively embrace pain and suffering not because you like pain and suffering but for two reasons one is because you've learned that the deeper the purification the deeper the ecstasy and you don't like to suffer but you like what's on the other side of the suffering but the second thing is you embrace the pain and suffering even knowing that a lot of it is not yours out of the same compassion that every father has for his children every mother has for her children and every teacher has for all of their children eventually that everybody has for other people and you embrace the pain not counting whether it's yours or somebody else's but because by doing so you are helping somebody you are helping other beings that you may never meet and my experiences has been that if you do that if you are willing to take on more than your fair share of suffering you reap more than your share of benefit you the universe responds it can't help but respond and i think that's going to be happening with us generationally this generation the next generation the generation after that is going to go through suffering more than their share of suffering compared to previous generations and after they stop kicking and screaming and begin to get down to taking it on and just doing it i think they will experience the blessings that come from that deep generosity that that profound existential choice to work with the given even when the given is terrible even when it kind of crushes your personal life but you still dedicate yourself to the good of the whole and in that process something begins to change something shifts inside your person and the more complete the surrender to the process the more complete the commitment to that process i think the deeper and the faster the transformation is in our individual lives and our collective lives so that as we move deeper into this and come through it i think generationally we will learn what every psychedelic journeyer learns that we confront the shadow there is riches on the other side of this ordeal uh and there's no other way to get to it uh and in the end the irony is you kind of end up where you were in the beginning except you're all cleaned out you're just all sorts of this gunk is out of your system so you are you and you are where you were before but you literally are living a different life because stuff that you hadn't realized was compromising you and burdening you is no longer there and something new has taken its place i think that's where we're going to be going it's going to take time there's a lot that has kind of come up there for me as you were talking around like the the complexity of the situation and how each different person and demographic is coming at this differently you know and then the confusion of what is good or what is not you know and then the kind of getting into you know like oh yes i'm gonna put myself in the pain of this you know does that look like being around people like does that mean getting involved in places where you know i'm i'm interacting with toxic people you know there's there's all these weird sort of complications and as i'm listening i'm i'm i'm efforting to hear it from a larger perspective than what's happening right now you know because if i think about generations that suffer i'd say that right now my demographic even my local community you know is not suffering nearly as much as people in the hardest hit areas of the united states with kovid and not nearly as much as people who are in poverty or who are you know are oppressed by systemic racism or sexism or whatever it is you know especially of course systemic racism is a huge and important issue and very like strong right now issues of police violence and all the rest um yeah but even then it's like is is that i'm just like trying to trying to break out of the thinking that wants to immediately point to small examples that don't fit into the larger generational narrative and i'm wondering if there's if there's something there that you want to comment on about about how the what you just said applies to the acute as much as the bigger picture yeah you're certainly right i mean in my local community uh we're not suffering not badly and i'm retired and i'm the i've been lost my job i don't i know where my next meal is coming from and a lot of people that's not true and then if we just expand the horizon the the hundreds of thousands of people who are uh migrants who are ecological migrants who are fleeing disastrous uh circumstances people whose whole lives fit inside a bag a suitcase that they're carrying they're everything they value in the world i mean it's just the upheaval we don't have to go very far to find it but even if it is far from our local community i i live in a strange world in that way i mean we all watch television we all try to keep abreast of the larger patterns that are out there but inwardly because of the psychedelic work because i've been dissolved so many times over so many years into the collective breadth of humanity and because i've been drawn into the collective shadow work the dark night of the collective soul work and have gone far beyond the collective psyche outside as outside of the collective unconscious into larger patterns of time deep time evolutionary time which you might think of as geologic time my insides are tuned a little differently because i at a sort of on a smaller scale when i see human beings i don't see human beings the way other people tend to see human beings i see souls i relate to human beings as incarnations of souls and so i'm always tuning to the soul quality of a person and in that respect for example we can see young people who are truly old in their heart and mind and we can see old people who are like children in their hearts and minds and everything in between so when i think of the people and what we're seeing on the streets and the and the people riding around and pick up trucks with carrying weapons and uh i'm seeing souls that are in a long they're in one phase of a long evolutionary journey at the soul's progression and i have a sense of some approximate sense of the the large scale of the self-education self-maturational process and some of the stage points along that's that scale and i don't bring that as a model that allows me to judge people and rank people and classify people but i approach people i approach people knowing that their entire current incarnation is just a short phase of their larger learning process and so i understand the challenges that they're facing within this larger context within this larger matrix um the tricky part is you can get so absorbed into large perspectives like that that you can lose the immediate immediate suffering you can lose sight of what it actually feels like to be undergoing the privations right here right now of many people so you have to live in both morals at the same time with the at hand and the large scale my professional work and my psychedelic work has focused me on the large scale yeah um chris i unexpectedly really have to pee i'm just going to take a take a little me and i'll be right back again okay okay wow okay so free all of a sudden much better yeah so there's a lot of inner conflict that's coming up for me as a as i'm listening to you um that part of me is like yes and another part of me is like does this like it's the smaller wind it's a smaller frame of like but does saying it this way does that does that equate to passivity does that equate to you know like you know if this is all part of a larger process is me just looking at myself you know like is that actually doing anything i know if i look at the large picture yes of course it's doing something you know i'm whatever helping to evolve and churn my soul and by doing good as best i can i help sort of bring goodness into reality more and then it can be sort of like in engaged in other people's realities or whatever else so on the on the one level i'm like yes but on another level like is that really enough there's a lot of sort of psychedelic rhetoric around like if we just gave more people psilocybin then we'd stop burning down the rain forest you know if we or say ayahuasca then we stop burning down rainforests we give people enough psilocybin you know then we'll we won't vote in um uh authoritarian leaders right yeah but i think that that that type of thinking on some level feels really it feels really foolish you know to think that if i just do the work that's going to make big changes in the world but that's going to properly address things and yet there's this whole other layer which is like but can i can i really do any good as a part of a social movement if i'm showing up with hatred in my heart and anger and just and projection and just looking for someone to blame for my suffering you know and some people are showing up because of that some not all obviously i don't think the movements are inspired by this i think they're inspired by a very appropriate response to injustice um yeah and then a whole other layer of me is like oh if i say this wrong will it be canceled um because of that sort of like you know blamey hatefulness in the heart so again these aren't clear questions i almost like i feel like i'm just like bearing my soul to you crystal like help me understand yeah like what is your perspective i understand i really do because if your spirituality if your genuine spirituality leads you uh away from social engagement in the world then i don't think it's a very mature spirituality because mature spirituality leads to that place in the heart where we contact the heart of all living things and when we contact the heart of all living things naturally we want to help all living things and so the natural progression of deep spiritual work when it succeeds is to be socially engaged in some form or another whatever we feel particularly called to some people are called to medicine they're going to do it in medicine some people are doing it with high-tech online international discussions some people they're doing it in all sorts of different ways but the important thing is that we find what it is that feels like our niche our particular contribution to make and we do it and you're right if we do it when we do it we'll probably end up finding that maybe we aren't as clean as we thought we were going in okay so we step back we clean we work that part but yeah i understand the tension it it i would feel it more if i were a young man like you uh i'm older and i'm in my 70s so in some ways i've had i've made my decisions around those things i've made my choices and mostly i'm past that active time except as a teacher you know i write i teach i talk i do what i can but other people my age they're out there on the front lines they're much more active on the front lines they really are plowing those fields they're really they are getting the vote out they are working very tangibly and practically to bring about a better world [Applause] no standardized rules for the engagement but we can feel when we there's a feeling in our center when we are aligned with our place in the world and our place in the movement we've got a balance point between inner and outer uh sheltered and and exposed and so we're self-correcting that we're self-correcting beings uh and what's most important i think is not rules of inner outer or how to engage and how what what not what not but uh tuning into that point in our center which is our connecting point to the larger intelligence which is always trying to draw us towards deeper and deeper levels of engagement with itself and that means with the fabric of humanity and or non-human life forms as you say that are also being affected a million species going extinct you know as we stand here as we sit here uh yeah i've been i've been sitting with the you know we're we were going to open up your book and maybe at some point we will um i have been sitting with the first thing i wanted to open the book to the first the first part of the book that received a red tab which was particularly important for quoting or reference as i have coordinated the color coding here and wondering how much it applies um in the sort of like the the comparing between a a deep psychedelic work or a deep psychedelic journey and the journey that we're on right now as a as an entire planetary organism facing the the increasing layers of collapse and catastrophe um in crisis that is just funneling more and more out of the year of clear vision and the the part is about one of the greatest risks of psychedelic work as you have put in the book being ego inflation and i'm curious looking around at the world that both people in the psychedelic community so maybe it's a real micro scale of like this is happening in sci culture you know and then the larger scale of like this is what's this is what i'm seeing play out in the in the big characters like the big characters like the the representations in the media and so on and so forth yeah i'm just curious about your comments on that well you know i'm essentially a hermit and even though i'm a member of the psychedelic community because i'm involved in psychedelics and thinking about them and i don't really have a lot of living contact with the psychedelic community i you know you go to conferences you know you used to go to conferences right you have workshops here and there you teach here and there but the actual number of people from this large community is relatively small and you you get impressions from the books but again since i'm older i'm not keeping track with all the latest articles i really will just pay attention more to the important books that come out not the small stuff uh and so i i don't know really what's happening in the psychedelic community uh so i can't generalize about that i think that in some ways we're moving into a psychedelic period of history and it may be starting at low-dose psychedelic history but we're going to be moving into high-dose psychedelic history when there will in in lodo's work you may engage voluntarily you know the ego dissolution process in high-dose work you will be engaged whether you volunteer or not you will be go put through the meat grinder and i think we're coming into a period of history where right now we may choose how to engage or how to pick the pain particular pain that we're going to take on it's going to come a time it's going to be the troll those choices are going to be made for us we're going to be surrounded by catastrophic consequences of the historical policies that we set in motion for decades and hundreds of years so it it's going to be it's truly like a hurricane coming off shore i mean this is like everybody's going to be affected everybody's going to be touched it's not going to be a pick and choose situation so i think that the great danger of psychic uh work is of psychedelic work is psychic inflation that is we think we have we've had a deep experience we think we've become a deep person we've had a great experience we think we've become a we are a great being and that of course is a fool's delusion whether the psychedelic community is in that position i don't know because i think you know if you do have that attitude then your own psychedelic sessions are going to knock your feet out from under you harder it's going to take you down so you learn pretty quickly that that's a that's a dead-end street to go and it becomes much much more basic than that and it's not about having extraordinary experiences to me it's not about i mean it's not about having ecstatic experiences or having to me it's about doing whatever is necessary so that 48 hours after your session is over you're living a better life than you did beforehand so you're either you spend your psychedelic session either taking a vacation to italy or you spend it carrying out the garbage carrying out the garbage is what's going to give you a better life two days after your session is over and if you carry out the garbage well then you're going to see some extraordinary things on the other side so for me the real work is carrying out the garbage that's i mean and and so why would you ever want to become more conscious than we already are if the consequence of being more cost conscious is to take more responsibility for the garbage that you are part of that's in your system and it's immediately around you so when you become more conscious you're going to have to do more cleaning so for some i know that other people don't necessarily feel that way for them psychedelics are a way to you know access joy you know you access great joy great thanks but uh when you come by those great joyful experiences of communion or great cosmic insights that flow into you when you come by them through hard work then it i don't think it then tends to lead to psychic inflation so much because you know the price you've paid to receive these blessings you you understand the deeper process and that the intelligence that gave you the blessings is teaching you is you know taking you along step by step and and so you these blessings are not given out lightly but they're given out intentionally and if you're if your psychedelic work is is really disciplined and it's really part of a spiritual practice for you then everything that you're given is also laying the foundation for work that you're going to do and gifts you will be given later because the your entire relationship with the universe is one of the maturational development and once you kind of feel the rhythm of this maturational development over the course of years in your work then that just puts aside it draws to a close all this sort of psychic inflation bullshit because it you know that that's just ego dancing and ego is the obstacle the the question that's kind of like i mean we we've kind of done this interesting sort of like dance and quasi pivot you know from these like big sort of global crises acute issues that we're in right now and then sort of like sort of like a larger cosmological perspective of the transformation of the human soul over millennia ultimately and that possibly we're in the we're in the beginning of this great painful suffering churning that will eventually polish us up on the other side um to becoming what in the book you call the the future human and now we're sort of like back into that kind of like we've pivoted into like direct psychedelic work and i don't know if this question feels i don't i don't know if this question is is sort of almost um like trite in a way because it's it's so general or what but i'm just holding it and it feels like i gotta ask it which is given where we are given what's happening and maybe you've already said this uh you've already answered this somehow but given where we are from the perspective of the deep psychedelic work that you've done you know what does it mean to be a good person right now what is it what does it mean to be um what does it take you know yeah man that's a large question i think of a half dozen ways to answer that question pop into my mind and all of them are wrong so i'm kind of sifting through [Applause] layers in some of my deepest experiences there are moments there are times when and even after a session but under the influence of the learning of a session when something just falls away something opens and i i experience the world truly as living and breathing as one i feel like my feet are rooted in the earth the way a tree is rooted in the earth i look down at the grass and i feel complete continuity of being between everything around me and my own being i feel it's breathing the same air i feel us all different species sharing the same moment in time i feel the pulse of the universe in its utter simplicity not paying attention to any of our divisions of species or moods or incarnations or anything like that the entire universe just being itself and i am part of that in grateful it's not even communion because communion implies a subtle duality and this is when all that falls away and a great transparency of being opens from within that position i experience an opening of my mind kind of a delicious sense of presence it gives me an intimacy with grass and then at a deeper level i experience an opening of my heart in which the idea of harming anyone is the farthest thing from my mind and the idea of helping everyone is the most natural thing in the world it's not being good it just it's it's being alive within this reality of oneness so to me goodness is simply an approximation are it's a it's a it's a compass needle that points in the direction of this fundamental truth of oneness and the truth of oneness is all these derivatives that flow from it circumstances but at essence it's very very simple and i think compassion goodness in that way fairness justice where all aspects of oneness are all kind of fractal manifestations of oneness so what does it take to be a good person today i think it takes a willingness a commitment to serving a collective good to serving a good that's not private that opens up to future generations that opens up to people who are unlike me and species who are unlike me just an honest confrontation with what is in order to bring about a better life for other beings i know this is very simple um but to me goodness is is is simple it is is that simple it gets complicated in the enacting of it but in the at its core it it's an action that comes out of oneness and if it's not coming out of a deep grounding in oneness then maybe there's something not to trust in it because deep goodness comes out of oneness i think now i don't know if this really addresses the depth out of which your question is coming because i i understand the true the true angst not angst but the true kind of quandary from which that question comes but the deepest answer i have in response to it i'm afraid is just a mystical experience a mystical experience of oneness in which that context goodness just becomes an insignificant component a spontaneous component just like the way you react when you see something beautiful it's just it's an arising it comes up inside of you goodness is simply an arising that comes up inside of you when you're in the condition of oneness i have a i have a maybe a more sort of serious response and i have a more joking response and the more serious response is is something along the lines of um [Music] like what what does it what does it look like to um what does the dance look like you said it becomes difficult in the enactment you know what does the dance look like between okay having that experience because i've had that experience and i can tell you fully 100 honestly that anywhere from 10 of the time to 99 of the time i'm not there at all there's no sense of it whatsoever in my experience you know and i i am and i'm not in the ground of that as i'm as i'm as i'm showing up in the world and i'm wondering yeah you know in the same way that also the playful response was so we all should all take 500 mics of lsd right [Laughter] no no in the what does it look like to have had that experience because the way that you speak about it and i think naturally it makes sense like when you're there goodness just flows from you right it is the most organic and natural expression of being in the world is when you're coming from that place and yet having a deep and profound experience doesn't make you a deep and profound person experiencing oneness doesn't mean that you now walk through the world inspired and infused in all your actions you know oneness just streams from your fingertips and every interaction is a blessing with the world from the depth of the oneness that i have embodied simply by taking enough mushrooms to touch it once so yeah what does it look like then i mean maybe this is a question around integration you know what does it mean to remember that and what does it mean to um to catch ourselves in forgetting yeah ah that's that is uh you know we we go up on the mountain we see some things we may be given some blessings and then we come down and then we have to go to work on monday morning and that's over and over again it means a matter of constantly uh engaging being aware of how you're engaging checking yourself recommitting yourself to doing a better job over and over and over again for me much of it was in my work as a teacher you know constantly always enjoying it always loving to be with the students always wanting to do it better but constantly catching myself making assumptions making false inferences not doing a good enough job being a little tired letting my students down on a particular day coming back and trying to do better coming to better the next day better the next week better the next semester over and over again trying to live up to the things that we know to be true integration is a is a strange term i'm not sure i'm glad that the psychedelic community is paying more attention to integration because it's really really critical but and there are dimensions and aspects of integration and the word integrate carries us to certain distances and doesn't carry us so far but it's it's hard to live our visions it's hard to live the truth of what we've seen it because it commits you to constantly being aware if you take the time to remember to pay attention to yourself how bad a job we're doing at living those truths but that's just that's the nature of the beast though uh we just it's constantly i mean if we are if we live around people who are really good people who really have a deeper natural instinct for goodness and kindness and generosity than we have then it makes it easier just to sort of face our own shortcomings because we have someone that we can look at and say ah that person is doing this better than i do so this gives me a measuring stick i can do better i'll i'll do it better tomorrow i'll keep working on it and that's why you know in the buddhist tradition spiritual friends people who are also have committed themselves to awakening that's really one of the great sangha community is one of the great pillars of progress so yeah you're right uh it's wonderful to have the experience but we don't walk around in that state but we practice and practice and practice and then maybe 10 years later we were in a little bit more 10 years later maybe we're in it a little bit more but uh practice and practice and practice and if we ever think that we're really there then we always do is ask our young children and they'll remind us that we're not really there as far along as we think we are our our kids will set us straight or perhaps or perhaps we could i think it was uh baba ramdas said if you ever think you're spiritually awakened go spend a week at your parents uh or something like that so maybe it's the other way around um yes yes uh as you were speaking i it was funny because a question started forming and then you had said something that i was like oh great i can point to exactly that to ask this question which is around you know being around people spiritual friends right the question is partly goes back to what you said around like if your spiritual practice means running away from the like not engaging in the world then it's probably not a very mature spiritual practice and i i agree and respect that very much um and then so there's a balance between you know like being in these spiritual having spiritual friends and so on and so forth but then not isolating oneself and only that experience but also engaging in being in the world right or being right in the world not of the world pardon pardon the reference but then right now it feels as though and i think in many ways this is because so much of our social interaction is mediated by screens and the influence of social media technology as well as the influence that in one way or another every interaction we have is also informed by is that person a loaded covid gun or whatever it is it's it's it's inspired by this sort of weird things we have this situation where we're not coming together right and so there's a lot of toxic interaction there's a lot of um charged emotional charge a lot of embodied emotional energy that's very tense you know there's a lot of being exposed to how shit the world actually is right now there's a lot of beauty in the world of course but that's not what we're having shoved down our uh uh down our throats or shoved through our eyes and so so the actual interactions with the world be they screen mediated or not is now in this landscape of a lot of people understandably so very contorted by the situation very contorted by the context and it's in that you know in that contortion that we generally aren't operating from oneness right so say for isolating ourselves and only our little friend group that everyone's spiritual and with the oneness and yada yada which ultimately is serving those people there but only to a certain extent and not anybody else and then being sort of in the world trying to be a person of goodness and oneness but encountering a lot of toxicity and close-mindedness and shunning and um and cancel and all the rest like how does a person walk this what does that walk look like good question isn't it good question it's going to look different for you than it will for me and it'll look different for different people in different circumstances uh i mean i've really years ago decades ago my life was as real as my students and so wherever i was on the weekends however deep i was on the weekends whatever spiritual practice i was doing at six o'clock on monday morning at 10 o'clock i was with my class and i was teaching in an open enrollment university people who were first generation college educated in a burned out steel town where opportunities were few and far between and this was front line education in america and you you it was hard work and we worked hard together so i had to be on my game engaging the world in my role as educator constantly confronting their assumptions encountering the engaging the the biases that they would bring to the discussions of the topics that as a professor of religious studies i was teaching and so you know i would laugh at my friends tease my friends who were teaching graduate courses maybe three graduate courses a year at their institutions where i was teaching nine quarter courses an academic year and then courses during the summer it's a really different kind of world so if i were answering your question 15 years ago when that was my life the hermit quality of my life would be balanced by my particular slice of the pie that i was responsible for which is helping these young people come to deepen an understanding of the world and of themselves in the disciplines that i was teaching now i'm in a different time of my life now i am out of that world now i am retired from that world uh and so and i buffer myself from a lot of screen time i really don't engage i mean i i really like you say it is so toxic it is so confused uh i don't think it helps me to immerse myself in that toxic confusion it doesn't help me maintain the clarity that it's my responsibility to maintain in my life so that when i do engage people i can be useful to people coming out of the space that i've that i am most comfortable with or not most comfortable but i most appreciate so i don't have to engage people nearly as much as you do and not nearly as much of people who are going to work nine to five they're front line on the covet scene and they're riding a bus they're riding a train and they're having to make all these decisions about who and what and what can i say and where should i sit and how do i breathe and all those things um but the principle is always the same i mean theresa mother teresa [Music] she worked with the poorest of the poor she started her work by basically dragging people off the streets of calcutta so that they could die with dignity in some small place we engage the world as we are as it is as circumstances are right now the circumstances is this pandemic that we are involved in and the political polarization that's being generated by that pandemic people are grabbing that world from so many different places so many places that um generalities are hard to come by except i come back again to that sense of inner integrity that kind of tells us when we are on and off course with ourselves whether we are aligned with our with our deep being or whether we're out of kilter with our deep being um and even in my isolation i have the feeling of whether i am aligned with my deep being or whether i am not aligned with it in terms of am i living myself my life in a way that will put me in the position to be of maximum benefit when i give this talk in two weeks or something like that that it's not something that happens on the day of presentation it's a whole it's with your life it's in is in tuned with your deepest aspirations and your deepest truths of what you know and believe so that when you are called upon you truly have something to give which is yours to give and that that that tuning into that center place takes place whether you're in the subway or whether you're at home by yourself it's just harder in the subway yeah i think um i think uh one of the things that's coming up for me is is something along the lines of um what that looks like for different people and what that looks like for different people looks like to me from where i'm coming from based on where they're coming from because there are people in this world who feel like they are doing exactly that and um what they're doing is putting you know taking their guns out for walks and and uh screaming at people for wearing masks right or they feel like they're doing that thing but what they're actually doing is propagating neo-nazi white supremacy or what they're actually they think that they're doing that thing but what they're actually doing is something emotionally violent immature and toxic which is canceling and anybody who disagrees with them and feeling reinforced in the righteousness of their beliefs by other people on the internet agreeing with them and them all bonding by bullying this person who has a different opinion from them right and that they feel like they're doing the good thing too and so um i want to be able to say that i know that me not doing those things is me doing the good thing and that my inclination is to think that what they're doing is not the good thing but then am i am i invisibly making myself a fool to think that i understand what goodness is and that my goodness is more good than their good you know is there is is i mean there's that question and then there's a larger question of like is it all good you know is actually them doing that good because goodness exists larger than the frame of reference of what my of what our immediate sort of like acute socio-political even lifespan time frame seems to state is good because we're incapable of recognizing let alone the second and third order consequences of our of our decisions but the 50th 60th the the seven generations consequence of our thinking you know is all of this good and if all of this is good then what does it matter what i do once again you're pushing into deep territory you know in the in the highest level of buddhist teachings in tibetan buddhist teachings exaction they would basically radically qualify goodness or the good that you know it's like doesn't make any difference whether you're doing good or not doing good if you're truly aligned with the absolute essence of all things it puts you in a different kind of category in relative to good and not good but until you are living into that in that absolute condition best to do good you know because that's the closest approximation we have to that absolute condition and i think one of the things that so i'm not willing though it is from that perspective one could relatively profoundly relativize good and i understand that my own personal orientations doesn't go in that direction to say it's all good i mean i i understand that it could be that we all think we're doing good but i'm not willing to say that all that we are doing is all good and one of the things is injuring other people injuring other people physically psychologically that to me is a is a marker of not good uh that's one of the places where you draw the line uh because oneness is all embracing and and it and the first rule that comes out of that is non-injury i think the people who are doing the things that you describe they have been doing it for a long time but right now they're doing it more publicly than they were doing it before before it may have been more private and surreptitious and individual but now they've been given permission in this greater social reinforcement and platforms on social media that reinforce an echo chamber and whatnot whatnot that reinforce those patterns the fact that people are self-selecting and reinforcing different patterns and all of that's taking place doesn't mean that um there aren't still choices of good of for goodness to be made and it doesn't mean that goodness is eliminated as a reasonable and rational and spiritually rich criterion for which to look at our behavior and ourselves doing various things um [Music] lynching even though it may be believed as being good is not good it's a it is a not good and a lot of people who did it believed that they were doing good when we wake up when we begin to wake up through which at whatever means when we are touched by a passage from scripture or whether we're touched in an ark in an ayahuasca session in whatever form when we wake up constantly over and over again genuine waking up produces gentler people it produces kinder people more compassionate people it doesn't improve it doesn't produce homophobic people it doesn't it produce people who are violence and inflicting violence on other people it always produces gentler more respectful people now that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that we necessarily don't fight for justice and we don't confront injustice as with what force we need to but the core balance is towards an equality of that that has a gentle component to it a compassionate component so then the question becomes how do you confront the not good knowing all the things we know about how people believe that they are doing good how do we confront the not good in a way which doesn't perpetuate evil or doesn't encourage more divisions in the world that's obviously a very very difficult question and only can be done piece by piece by the person in circumstances in specific circumstances if i step back and try to generalize then i'm just i'm just blowing smoke you know this can only be done from really people who are living in the circumstances and making decision whether to go to the protest whether to counter protest how to address violence when it meets you on the street so on and so forth do you think that the what feels like the the the almost ubiquitous rise of of what is often called bad faith arguments and the almost total um devolution destruction of discourse as a consequence of basically all conflict being received of and responded to as a form of abuse how i'm not sure what the question is here um what is the question here what role do you see um what role do you see conversation open discourse between the various expressions of self-perceived good um as playing in the the evolutionary process we're in as as humans and and how do you balance that with the the understandable limitation of well i'm not really particularly interested in giving a voice or a space for a hateful racist or a hateful whatever and a violent person to have a voice i don't want to speak to them i don't think that they should have something to say what is what is the balance there in the course of doing good and trying to bring about goodness in this world that is a a large question again a huge question of which i have a very limited framework from within to respond to it um partly here's my background is i'm an academic and i'm an academic in the history of religious thought in the history of philosophical thought in a discipline that that prizes engagement it prizes discussion it prizes collaboration and conflict as a vehicle for determining greater truth i've gone through multiple revolutions in my own thinking the hardest pivot in when you move from a world view with certain sets of assumptions in a certain way of seeing the world the hardest pivot is the first one because that's when you let go of a sense of being grounded in reality and you have to step back and when you pivot in certain fundamental beliefs then you suddenly realize that what you had taken as reality was just a model of reality and you're dealing with models and models when the second and third and fourth time you make that pivot as you continue to shift and grow it does get easier because you realize you know you discover that you're living within a matrix of assumptions a paradigm of assumptions so i've gone through being a conventional christian to being a non-christian to being deeply informed by science and the scientific worldview to challenging some of the core axioms of a reductive materialist interpretation of science through the psychedelic work and i've been in dialogue with people all the years all these stages not only my students but all the faculties and colleagues and people who i've spent my entire academic career disagreeing with and still managing to be friends with and working with students and allowing them to voice opinions in the room which i find abhorrent and yet it's essential for them to be able to express themselves if there's ever going to be a chance of opening up a possibility that they can see the world from a little different perspective but all of that is within a certain frame of reference in which there is a set of rules about the give and take and the limits of give and take what's happening today is a very different world in this sheltered world that i've been functioning in inside a university this is as you say it's a dissolution of standards it is a radicalization of everyone's got the right to their own position and every position is as valuable as any other and in the end it comes down to might makes right or the the vote of the majority however coerced and contrived that is it's a very different world and when i try to fathom that world i think we are living in a time i mean we we know it we're in a time of paradigm change we are in a time when certainties are becoming uncertainties constants are dissolving so many reference points that people have used to orient themselves are being changed i mean science changed so much and now science has changed itself so much when it began to point to 96 of reality is invisible dark matter and dark energy how the hell do we live in a universe like that how do we live in a universe as big as the universe as we're describing all the religions of the world have all come together in one valley it's like rivers have come together into one valley and just meeting each other as we have in the last two centuries has forced for anyone who's paying attention has forced a radical reassessment of all of our truth claims of all of the certainties that we've had about what we know to be true and what we know god is doing with the world and and when we look when just in this complexity of plurality that we're dealing with just within my set of disciplines it opens up it taps into this deep deep uncertainty that well maybe we really don't know what god wants and maybe we really don't know what the truth is and maybe we really have to go look not only in our sacred scriptures but in their sacred scriptures and in their sacred scriptures to even begin to deal with some type of approximation that might become more adequate than it was before and so many of these things are missing right now this thought of self-awareness of the limitations of one's paradigm of our cultural embeddedness that's missing from much of this discussion so but we see it all in acting out we're at a time of a falling apart of values we can't even count on nature to be whole the patterns that it had held for us for all these centuries the weather patterns are different the rain patterns are different the heat patterns are different not even nature is allowing us to stay in the comfortable domain immigration patterns are different racial balances in our country are different so many differences so many things people are scared people are unstable people are grabbing they're hiring to hold on to and from one perspective you can say yes yes yes good luck with that because it's going to keep falling apart it's going to keep getting worse and if you're not able to deal with that you're going to suffer enormously if you keep trying to hold on to old values you're going to suffer terribly and you're going to cause suffering and that suffering is going to come back on you uh to me it's not just that the world is a dirty and uglier place and the academic university is uh because the academic university can be a pretty dirty and ugly place in its own form in its own genre but underneath our culture the constants are falling away the the the legs are being kicked out from under the table this just tremendous uncertainty and truth has been a casualty of that truth has been a casualty of that process as well a sense of feeling truth but we'll get through it we have no other choice because this is a truth that we live in we live in a pluralistic society we live in a sexually pluralistic society we live in a in a society of multiple truths we live in a culture of multiple truths we live in a world of expanding truths of it just expanding horizons over and over and over again it's very uncomfortable to live in such a fluid world but if we're not good at it now we better get good at it within the next generation or two because this is not going to change we're not going to go back into the tried and comfortable world of the past we are only going forward into new and uncertain territory and we're going into it together we have to kind of grow up we have to grow up we have to stop acting and arguing like adolescence we have to start acting and arguing like adults and adults have a a time horizon and a perspective that you don't have when you're an adolescent and adults can hold their temper more and they don't cause injury like adolescents do and so [Music] it's grow up or die time we have to grow up we have to stand up we have to measure up to this to the higher demands of growing truth yeah because truth is growing truth is expanding we're trying to keep up with it hard time mm-hmm yeah i mean this this whole conversation i just i mean i keep throwing really hard questions at you and incredibly i'm just or increasingly like wow this is all so difficult i mean you think these questions are difficult the fact that we even are asking them means we're in a reality that is far more difficult than even just looking and forming the questions right and you're asking me questions about things i don't really know much about i mean ask me one about that i wrote a book about i know it's so funny i thought i was going to ask you about psychedelics i'm sitting here i feel like i'm in satsang or something and you're just like what does it mean to be a good person grace how do i face the meta crisis yeah well we're all in this together we are all in together all your listeners and all the people who are not listening we're all in it together you know what's wonderful about this conversation and the conversations that you encourage is that it pushes peaceful boundaries in a safe and respectful way it invites them to become more self-reflective more self-aware it invites them to read more books and to learn more and to become less reactive and more integrated in their presence that is a mode of it's not just the content that comes from these kind of discussions which can be useful to people but the mode of the conversation itself the mode of disciplined inquiry it's you know you you read the books you've done your homework you know what the issues are that we're going to talk about but the the quality of engagement is itself a model for how we need to do to move forward where we're going you know and that's a great value well thank you i kind of feel like uh i i recognize that in myself in the sense of what i'm attempting to produce and also in what i'm consuming i'm you know like i'm kind of just coming out of this place where my response to all of this at first was like okay my nervous system's on overload i'm gonna play playstation and i'm gonna just like do the absolute bare minimum of just like i had a bunch of podcast things recorded and i was just like doing the bare minimum just trying to get the podcast already recorded out and then at some point increasingly i've i'm removing myself because i don't have the ability to participate in this degenerative social discussions i previously was a part of in my community in the same way and i'm looking to find myself and surround myself with the type of um quality of conversation and topic of conversation and um and uh angle of addressing the topic and the quality um because otherwise you know i am the five people i spend most time with or i mean that's a pretty strong generalization but if the five people i'm spending most time with is whatever happens to be trending on twitter and and facebook which is like the algorithms basically push for like maximum attention um maximum attention grabbing and what tristan harris calls like a race to the bottom of the brain stem and it's all limbic hijacking and all the rest and the it's it's just like a it's just a dynamic of outrage in one way or another then that's the world i'm in and that's the way i'm gonna engage things and i see that i want the podcast to be something different you know it's like a delic i mean but it's not you know it's like it is about psychedelics but it's more about being someone who uses psychedelics and has a psychedelic perspective trying to make sense of life in real life and i'm trying to also surround myself with the types of conversations and discussions and topics that are helping me stay in that so i can keep being a part of and contributing to that kind of world because i'm looking at this this balance somebody i've been really listening to a lot recently daniel schmucktenberger talked about trying to well it's kind of hard to really know if i ever understand what he's saying because he's i feel like he's way too smart for me um or i'm not smart enough or something you know it's real humbling listening to talk listening to him talk uh something along the lines of like trying to find that place between you know recognizing what what's going wrong with the world and all the things going wrong and what am i actually able to do like what am i actually able to do yeah rather than trying to solve what's wrong with the world being like okay i got a sense of it but what am i actually able to do and and right now it feels like this is what i'm actually able to do yeah i understand that and i don't do twitter feeds i don't do instagram i spend very little time in social media all together so at the cost at the risk of separating myself from the pulse of where people are where i live is not where most people live and one of the reasons i live in a different place is because of psychedelics when i when i experience what's happening it's within a different historical horizon than most people experience what's happening and when i am concerned for the people who are suffering even that is from a different perspective because of the psychedelic experiences that have taught me to recognize the different levels of being that are present in a human body the different levels of soul inside a human body and then to recognize even the different levels of soul maturation which are in a species in an historical period and that's contextualized within an ex an intimate experience of the aliveness of the universe that the universe is alive at core in every blade of grass and every every gyration of the planets in the movement of the galaxies it is alive and its intelligence and its intelligence is constantly knocking on the back of our mind constantly asking for permission to enter and to infuse us more with its understanding to to attend that deeply to the invitation that the universe gives us requires stepping out of twitter feeds and instagram feeds and this buzz buzz buzz which is important but if you want to it's like if you want to understand where we are in our universe and where we are in the galaxy and where our galaxy is you have to go out at night under a dark sky with no surrounding lights and and let your eyes adjust to the darkness and stay focused there for a long time and then listen very carefully and it's the same way with inner knowing inner knowing requires a stepping back out of the give and take of daily discourse tuning in deeply and i've been blessed in that i've my life has afforded me an unusual amount of time to do that without taking on monk's robes uh you know that's so my whole experience of the challenges that we're facing all of them are really not based on earthly wisdom you know this i try to frame it as best i can earthly wisdom but my framing my deepest understanding of what's what are really the challenges that are we're facing and what's really driving the the social context that we're in you know they come out of my psychedelic work they come out of a very very different perspective than even a time space perspective or i would say that the time space perspective is at best fifty percent at best fifty percent and the other fifty percent or more really comes out of a an intimacy i don't want to say with the divine because that brings us back to the culture wars how do we define god but and so that's why i talk about the mind of the universe and intimacy with the generative intelligence of the universe an intimacy with the creative intelligence of the universe that to some degree has taken me under its wing because i was willing to pay the dues to snuggle up inside there and [Music] you never look at life again as you know after you've been into those intimate places when you've been dissolved into the into the deepest pulse of life that you've ever known you never experience life the same way again [Music] and if you've if you've nurtured a deep and long connection to this deeper knowing which transcends history in a profound way you never you never experienced life the same way as you did before you now have a it's not like you have the answers or you have the knowledge which solves things but there is a there's an intimacy it makes you very sensitive to how much fear drives things and when you've when you've dissolved all the fear that you've ever been asked to dissolve when you when you dissolve all of that and you enter into those territories which uh in which there is no fear and there is only truth and only insight and only understanding and only love and compassion then when you come back out of that and and you look at life around you so much of it is driven by fear and so little understanding and so many people are afraid of dying and so many people are afraid of losing this that and the other because that underneath it they're fundamentally afraid for their own existence for their just they're afraid of dying and if you lose that if you are no longer afraid of dying and you're no longer afraid of that deep restructuring whether or not you are challenged by short-term restructuring or not you come at it from a very different perspective you just live it from a different way so to me you know lsd in the mind of the universe is a psychedelic memoir it's a whole life's work that is reflected there so it's a journey that's why i like the title diamonds from heaven better because it it's a story of a journey of deepening intimacy and when you when you come out of that you i remember when i would do a session and at the end of the session someone i would pick me up at the end of the day and take me to where i would be that night and once in a while we had to go buy a grocery store and as you can imagine there are a few places stranger to be than an american grocery store after you've come down from a serious psychedelic session it's like being in disneyland i mean it's like in a strange strange world something as simple as a grocery store can be uh that's our work though isn't it when we we go into this space we we enter into deeper intimacy with whatever it is that's driving the universe and then we come back and we try to live our lives as best as we can this is what reincarnation does reincarnation plunges into it pulls us out connects us to spiritual reality again plunges us back in and then we go out again and back and forth and back and forth a psychedelic session will do the same thing but on a smaller orbit it basically kills the earthly life it shatters the earthly life and opens us up to what it's like to die into this great surrounding world and then after the session we come back and we're alive inside time and space again and then a few months later we'll shatter out into outside time and space so we're reproducing reenacting the dynamic of nature in reincarnation and whatnot once you do that enough times and once you incarnate enough times then you you cease to to relate to the world the way you did before and in much of this aberrant social behavior that we see around us what i see is so much youth is so much an experience there's so much naivete maybe badness but more than badness i see something that makes me feel terribly sad i see people not knowing better and if you ask why don't they know better at core i'm looking at a soul and i think why does this soul not know better and at core of that it's like jesus they're babies they're children they're adolescents they just haven't matured enough to really understand the deep reciprocity that exists between human beings which leads to a respect of human beings no matter what they are no matter who they are that's well that's childishness really and psychedelics grow us up i mean if you do them right if you use them carefully they accelerate our maturation they don't make us perfect they don't fill us up with you know eternal truths but they do force us to become more mature than we were in the beginning if we if we engage them responsibly well that might be a good place to to call to a close i feel like that was a really great way to end um chris i want to thank you for sitting down and addressing a bunch of questions that a couple maybe a little bit for the most part 80 of this had nothing to do with your book i didn't even open it up as to what's the plan and i really asked you to go to the edge of your thinking i feel like i really asked you to go to the edge of your thinking today um on some difficult questions and i feel really i feel really nourished by what came of it and i and i trust that my listeners will will feel the same or at the very least something something will come up worthy of talking about um and so i i really appreciate your time today chris you bet i trust our conversations i trust what comes out of them i trust where they go i hope they're useful uh to the people who tune into your podcast it's always a joy uh to talk with you james thank you chris i'm gonna show your book here for those uh who are watching on the youtube lsd and the mind of the universe um it's a very good book and i'm gonna put a plug in for a book of a friend of mine because if if you are concerned about the birth of the future human and if you're concerned with the historical crisis that we are entered and you want deeper understanding my book gives a psychedelic vision of where we are and where we're going but this book let's see right here is it showing here yeah i see it choosing earth humanity's great transition to a mature planetary civilization yeah doing nails and you can see it's not a big book it's a thin book it won't take you a lifetime to read it really really really fine book looking at where we are where we're going and how to navigate the times we're entering very fine book cool thanks for the suggestion chris uh last thing is there anywhere given how damning we were of social media throughout the course of this interview are there places on social media that you'd like to direct people towards well in a couple of months they can go to chrisbache.com the website will eventually appear there i'm so i'm so social media out of it i don't haven't fulfilled my responsibility to have the website up and done they can reach me at my university email address which is bash my initial c m bash at ysu dot edu they can contact me there for the time being but in a couple of months they'll be able to go to chrispaige.com great well thank you very much chris and uh looking forward to the next conversation me too james always and cut okay thank

support the show financially patreon is a great option where you can pledge a monthly an amount to be sent forth monthly as little as a cup of coffee once a month everything is something and it all adds up to allow me to earn income while dedicating myself full-time to the show and to the larger body of psychedelic research that i'm putting into and out into the world um and i had mentioned there was a special announcement after the interview so i'll just let it go now which is that i'm going to be taking a two episode break for the next little while so if you're new to the show it's a

some insider information uh but also includes some exclusive content that's just gonna be for you guys as well and uh yeah so i'm taking a two-episode break to sort of like clean house metaphorically

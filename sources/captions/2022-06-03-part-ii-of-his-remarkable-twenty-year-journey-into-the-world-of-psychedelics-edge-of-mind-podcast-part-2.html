      <p>welcome everybody to our ongoing edge of mind podcast where i have the great honor and delight to spend a little bit more time with this remarkable thinker psychonaut explorer of the mind and heart um christopher beige and really continue to unpack unfold some of the many aspects of his remarkable journey that we introduced in round one of my conversation and so um i will reiterate a very brief bio of chris and then we're just going to jump right in and slowly venture into um hopefully some rich deep waters so uh christopher beige is a professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at youngstown state university where he taught for 33 years a fellow at the institute of nomadic sciences he was also adjunct faculty at the california institute of integral studies and on the advisory board for graft transpersonal training and the graf foundation an award-winning teacher international speaker who's the author of three books and lives in portland and you're still in portland right actually we're in weaverville north carolina now just oh okay well i'm glad i asked yeah yeah so chris thank you again for for taking time to return um and unfold with me some of the remarkable implications of your your journey so at the outset deep out of gratitude for you it's a pleasure to be with you today andrew thank you for the invitation yeah really i i deeply appreciate it and so what i thought what we could explore is i was rereading some of the material especially the latter type of chapters in your journey lsd in the mind of the universe that's mostly what we're going to be unfolding but also conjoined with the living classroom because there's obviously some wonderful interconnectivity between those narratives that will be woven into this but i thought what we could we could introduce is um a narrative a topic that's very near and dear to my heart right now so much so that i'm writing one book on it and probably two and i think we pinged on this just a wee bit in our first session but i want to explore it in a little bit more detail now because um to me i think using your languaging it this this narrative of openness and contraction is really i've i've come to see it as kind of the combustion cycle of the spiritual path and so i thought we could start with that narrative as a way to perhaps like a like a fractal reiterate the entirety of your journey within the session itself in other words start a little bit more with this narrative and maybe continue to expand to open into deeper and deeper dimensions as in fact your journey both during the 20 years and after um took you through as a way to really uh talk both in a kind of philosophical and also and the reason i love these um terms sense i love the notion of of openness and contraction because these are things we can feel i mean they're not just cerebral intellectual storylines these are things that we can feel on our body mind matrix and so um i i would like to dive into that with you as we perhaps um set our direction towards what i consider to be the the climax of your book the the diamond luminosity but because that light is so bright that space is so open that we perhaps can dilate the aperture of our awareness our hearts and minds a little bit more slowly and start by sending a question in your direction about how this uh your journey could be articulated in this expression this kind of pulsation or the hindus talk about it beautifully in the tradition of spanda the doctrine of vibration which i'm starting to see now and i'll share some of my own experiences and insights of openness contraction openness and then contraction so maybe we could start there and then that i think will lend us um gradually into wider and wider and perhaps you know greater degrees of openness okay you bet that's a good place to start so in my understanding in my experience psychedelics in general and in particular lsd which was my primary medicine in this journey is an amplifier of consciousness and so when consciousness is amplified uh signals which are quiet get large get loud and you have a sensation of your becoming aware of more and more how you meet that increase of awareness how you engage what emerges is seminal in the process if you uh engage the shadow consciously you confront those things which keep you habitually contracted and small you engage those fears or whatever it is you take them to their source to the root they resolve themselves and when they resolve themselves your consciousness is free to open into more spacious places every time you let go of something which is holding your consciousness in a fixed pattern or holding it small particularly initially your your time space identity your historical egoic identity that tells us who we are but if you can let go of that you discover that there are these dimensions beyond your time space identity which are even more truly really what you are and if you keep this going you go through multiple layers of consciousness there's a point where you have to let go surrender or die not only to your individual identity but to your identity as a human being per se there is a deeper sense of humanity that defines that holds the limits of your knowing and there's a going even deeper there's a sense of time-space identity you you let go of your entire existence including all your reincarnational experiences of time space as a framework for holding experience and your experience flows beyond time and space and this is an entirely natural process i think thought of as a broader conjecture my understanding of what happens inside a psychedelic session is that it basically accelerates and intensifies what is taking place in nature all the time so when we are born our consciousness contracts into our an individual egoic time space identity when we die we expand there's a sense of expanding back into the souls back back into deeper spiritual awareness when we're born we contract when we die we expand and so what happens in a session it simply accelerates and intensifies this natural process which is taking place in history over a longer period so what it allows you to do is to accelerate that process and to start by burning off more karma than one might get around to otherwise that's the same thing that happens in meditation of course too same dynamic and it's interesting isn't it my favorite running definition of of meditation these days um is habituation to openness um and i find it there's so many implications to that chris because i mean parenthetically the buddha we know etymologically usually translated as the awakened one but i've also heard renderings as the opened one and so the reason i find this beautiful for a number of reasons is in country distinction we're the contracted ones and so by by bringing this the reason i think this is so important is because by bringing this process this phenomenology into the light of our conscious awareness we can better sensitize ourselves to it in a more um somatic sense it's against something this is something we can feel this is not just a cerebral intellectual um thing we we can feel this process of contraction and openness within our very so much and and for me what i'm curious chris is two things one how early in your journey did this become apparent to you i mean how i i can't remember all your sessions with great specificity but where did this narrative become identifiable for you how did it help you as you continue to go further and then um parenthetically just so i don't forget this as well the other thing i find around this narrative that's so helpful that you were suggesting at the outset is that we're practicing this whether we know it or not we're we are either on the path of practicing habituation to openness or if we don't know it and most of us don't by default we're practicing contraction every time we capitulate to grasping to beliefs to a sense of i mean virtually everywhere that is our default contraction and so again i know i'm throwing a couple things out there but i think this is so foundational for me that after decades when i look back it's like oh my gosh i can really look with a new sense of understanding from this altitude wow my whole journey has been this kind of pulsation opening expanding how much of that can i deal then metabolizing contracting so a little bit around that a little bit more on that sure it actually started in the very first session in my very first session i hit an experience where i could not remember anything about myself i could not remember who i was what i was i couldn't remember what i did for a living i could not remember whether i was a man or a woman i was absolutely jammed and i looked in a thousand mirrors i couldn't find any piece of individual egoic identity and it was of course very jarring frightening in the beginning and then later in the session my sense of identity returned but it that experience was really important because it told me at first it gave me an insight into the dynamic it shook me up and it showed me a certain measure of the true cost you know because i had read about ego death and i thought oh good let's do it and i hadn't appreciated this is a true death this is a loss of your identity um and it basically um taught me to the art of letting go and the art of surrender because if you can't control your self-identity identity and that's about as basic as it gets and so later when the ante kept increasing uh i knew that the key to navigating whatever was coming was to surrender let it go and it it stopped me from trying to hold on to something familiar hold on something i could identify with and that just then that just went on it escalated from there about two and a half years later when my individual egoic identity was turned inside out and just crushed i went through a collapse of that smaller state and they rebirth into a deeper state and then later and through after the ocean of suffering after spending two years in that you know surrounded by the historical suffering of humanity and these unfinished memories painful memories there was a death process which then catapulted me into a deeper level of reality beyond the collective unconscious into archetypal consciousness and this pattern just kept repeating itself so but it started very early on and then then it's just the texture of the openness differs the context differs the purity of it differs there's a lot of light of course engaging in fields of light but i found that light itself also has gradients they're various kind of levels of purity of light levels of clarity of light and so the the actual content of openness is it changes in the work but the phenomenon that of opening into something larger something deeper now now i want to caution this a little bit qualify it the sensation and the certain stages of work and what i would call the psychic and subtle levels of consciousness the sensation often is of getting larger and i think this is characteristic of subtle level reality some level of states of consciousness and then later much later in the journey this experience was just reversed that is i i was experiencing huge feels of light contracting yeah into the present and just exploding me into that into some different state of consciousness but everything was contracting contracting so i began to realize that the whole subject i even began to wonder whether we had mis identified the nature of psycho psychedelics by calling them mind openers yeah i understand but at another level they are mon mind contractors where you're contracting deeper and deeper and deeper into the present present present present until you drop into a very different experience of that present so openness we we just want to be careful to recognize that there is a there are different modalities it's it's a multi isn't it chris it's a multivalent term right it has it has um different iterations and context and several things come to mind here that's the contraction into the present moment it's very interesting in a languaging that i'm familiar with and you may be familiar with this too papa sambaba talked about it as the fourth moment which one can only actually access through the conduit of the present moment so what an interesting kind of juxtaposition and almost clash of traditional um approaches where on one level by contracting in the healthy sense and again this is i think super important because in in and of itself contraction is utterly non-problematic we we couldn't operate in the world without that aspect of that pulsation and so we tend to clamor towards openness as that somehow being the ultimate spiritual thing i think provisionally there's some truth to that but if we can't merge that openness with a contraction then contraction becomes the bad boy the bad girl and we look at it in kind of a limited way but in my experience in padmasambhava use this language of the fourth moment you contract you condense into the portal the it becomes the portico into the timeless beyond where you come to the present moment and then that blows up so to speak um into the fourth moment which transcends even the present moment itself and i think that's helpful because we're going to start the tread into waters where languages will because it's dualistic and nature becomes problematic and as you know in the buddhist tradition one has to be or is invited to be incredibly articulate precise in order to realize when we use this term exactly how we're using it in what context and so i think therefore it seems like well wait a second isn't the whole thing about opening well yes but it's also honoring the the process of contraction and how that can then lead to this yeah you know you're mentioning padma zambawa gives me an opportunity to once again emphasize the point that uh there are correlations and i'm grateful for the correlations between my experiences and those recorded by the great beings the padma zambawas of the world the great contemplatives but this path that i was on is not that contemplative path it's a path of temporary immersion so when i'm describing things it always has to be understood that this is a temporary experience which then to unpack the spiritual potential of that temporary experience you know we can have that conversation but it's it's not the same as when you come into these experiences using what you might think of as the slow bake method of sustained contemplation you know so i just always want to be careful to keep apples and oranges separate and uh because so many people good point they think oh i've had a tremendous revelatory enlightenment experience and that's you know it says well good for you but but that's it's that's a temporary experience that is unbelievably important i mean how does the saying go an enlightened experience does not make one an enlightened being i mean that's as you know that's a difference in that language in between experience and realization by definition yeah experience always has a beginning and an end yeah and in order to mature that and that's very interesting because that's a large part of the pathway i think a lot of people really get tripped up i speak from my own experience you have these tremendous metanoias these openings you think you're enlightened and then what do you do you grasp after that and you just replace the chain made of lead with one made of gold and so yeah therefore understanding that there's there's the path quality of continuing that and so just to reinstate a couple things when you're talking about deeper states just to make sure i'm understanding you chris it seems to me that you're also saying a deeper state is is somewhat synonymous with them with a more open state that is you're waking in you're also expanding and then and then perhaps as you pointed out that that it then points or um directs to us how it is that we're constructing this self-sense moment-to-moment this is the other thing i think that is incredibly important that we we tend and i'm speaking from like confessional thing we tend to think that the ego structure the self-sense is this monolithic reified entity and this is where we can learn a lot from our scientific brothers and sisters in science uh physics and neuroscience it's a it's a process it's not a product the self-sense is constantly being constructed and therefore when you go through this type of deconstruction or demolition derby by immediate implication you can see through the process of demolition the process of construction and therefore how we are responsible for the way we contract and we do so largely for purposes of protection fear and the like but is that is that a fair representation of what you discovered it is it's it's a fair representation and it's a way it's a description which fits better in some ways the early stages of the work where you are still kind of working at um insights which help you understand your individual way of being in the world and then you know i describe my work fundamentally as a work in cosmological exploration where not only do you leave your individual ego behind you know at least temporarily and you leave but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind at least in my experience and are given the opportunity to explore um how the universe constructs its reality how archetypal reality structures time and space reality how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical of all life forms of all atomic nuclear quantum life forms uh how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious fertile essence which is giving birth to time and space i mean the vast you know the vastness of time and space moment by moment minute by minute so it is you know very useful to understand your personal way of contracting the personal way of you know sustaining your smallness but for me uh i mean not trained as a philosopher i wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality and so the invitation that that was given to me was just to explore how time and space is made and i wish i mean i so often wish i had a phd in physics and astrophysics i mean i could have understood so much more of what i was being shown but you know always the universe can only communicate to you successfully that which you have the capacity to understand yes exactly oh that's a what a fantastic statement chris because to me it's like and this is what you suggest towards the interview book when you were wrestling struggling working with this process of integration how in a very real way you using this particular mechanism disintegrated opened open opened and then and then really in my languaging here um using frameworks that we're both familiar with that this notion of in the indict traditions this pedagogical approach i think we might have hit it on last session of of hearing contemplating meditating my languaging ingest digest metabolize and what the way i read your experience that i think is really worth talking about is that you you open to such an extent and i can speak a little bit from my own experience that then the issue became one of of digestion and metabolism and and the reason i mentioned this that i think has tremendous applicability is that sometimes when we look at things like psychosis and you were treading sometimes that thin membrane between transcendence and in psychosis the loss of self-sense that the the issue of integration bringing that in in a certain way and part of my kind of play on languaging here is that um psychosis can be in fact a type of eating disorder that you actually open to such an extent that then you you actually don't have the capacity you don't have the infrastructure the wherewithal to digest and metabolize and then instead of opening body mind you blow body mind and sense of reference is then completely so decimated that that is one way to perhaps talk about the whole psychotic aspect and the risk perhaps some of the perils of doing this type of deep diving i understand and you're certainly right that doing this type of work does carry certain risks and has to be approached cautiously and uh with careful uh support structures in place and careful self-monitoring and so on and so forth i don't think and i do understand uh the relationship between psychosis and transcendence and i think it was that houston smith who said uh a mystic is someone who learns how to swim in the waters in the vast waters and the psychotic drowns that it's like actually artie lange in my case i understand the psychotic looking qualities of loss of self that but i i would not ever i would not describe my experience as walking that particular edge and if i had gotten into a situation where i felt i was at that edge i would have changed course i would have done something differently my experience was that by working in a very carefully clinical type modality and opening systematically the universe really opened me systematically in a way beyond my calculation but it opened me very very carefully and so it peeled me carefully and it broke me open layer by layer by layer if it had catapulted me you know beyond beyond beyond so quickly then i could have had problems integration but in my experience i always uh opened and i always congealed comfortably and carefully and if i had not congealed comfortably and carefully then i would have been given pause because that's a symptom of something really going wrong so it's not the depth of loss of self which marks the psychotic episode i think it also has to do with a kind of confusion but i absolutely agree you have to walk these waters very carefully i seem to have a kind of a natural constitution i mean you know i started this work i never came from any traumatized background just the ordinary you know pains of growing up and whatnot but i i had fundamentally a core strong self um and i also had a capacity it's in my natal astrological natal chart a capacity to open and an interest in opening up into the vast expanse of consciousness and to con contract back so if if you don't have that natural capacity or if you're bringing in disruptive trauma or other qualities in your person then very much this work may not be for you you know it's it's a little bit like jack angler famously said and i think it's appropriate statement you have to be someone before you can be no one that's right they're they're i think that cannot be overstated that they're the ego itself fundamentally is non-problematic it's a developmental stage it's just a form of arrested development and so if you don't have that stable self-sense then in fact then instead of dis differentiating you dissociate and then that's where it becomes somewhat problematic then the ability to find that identity to find some refuge becomes really somewhat disconcerting but chris towards the end of your book um i want to come back to this just a little bit because my understanding of what you're sharing towards the end like what what dictated stopping after the 73rd journey was and i found this one on the most compelling um pardon the pun electrifying parts of your book where it was it was as if your body mind matrix had become so open and we talked about this last time this is so important this kind of tantric work body is as important as mine when you're opening your mind you are opening your body and as you open your body even the classic inner yogic sense all these energies what they talk about is the winds come through and if those winds aren't ridden properly they can throw you and so if i understand what you said towards the end in a certain way your system was running too hot there was so much energy so much release that again this is this returns us to this digestion in a metabolism component it was like my cup runneth over i have i have enough experience here to spend the rest of this life or other lives now digesting this feast yeah and so is it isn't that a fair way to recapitulate what you said at the end that you stopped the feast because there was just too much to eat i think i think that's a fair description um in my case i don't i think it's not because i didn't ride the wind successfully i think i rode the wind successfully but i rode the winds too long in the sense i mean they were just they would stretch me out so so wide and so deep and i think this is um you know in the early stages of psychedelic use both individually and i think culturally we get excited by having being able to have contact with the transcendent dimensions and that's so liberating and it's so intellectually you know opening to us to the intelligence that lives in the universe that is the universe um but our our tradition is our theological and even our contemplative traditions i think tend to except at the very highest levels tend to underestimate the dimensions of the divine or underestimate the dimensions of the universe so that leads us to underestimate how vast the world is that we can open into psychedelics do give us the capacity even when they are used well and i i hope i use them skillfully and responsibly but even when i did that it basically opened me so deeply into such intimacy with the universe transcending time transcending space and even though i contracted back okay the memory yeah the beauty the memory of the communion was just so dear and so um intense that uh i could not i could not take return and coming back i just couldn't do it anymore uh yeah you couldn't you couldn't go to the train station and leave your lover one more time right yeah yeah and i just i just had to stay here okay and uh let her come to me in whatever form was possible by me not going into a non-ordinary state but staying here and letting and just digesting like you said i i picked up a lifetime and more of experiences to to digest and so let me ask you this and i hope it's okay if we go in into some i mean the book itself is so intimate it's so personal that i don't think i'm violating um any borders with you but if if i go into areas where it's like yeah i don't want to go there you will not offend me okay but but what you said at the end so much was any of the book i was really moved by this because in a certain way when i look back over my own life chris it became more articulate over the last couple years my entire life has been as a way learning how to prepare to die i mean i wrote a book by their title and in in the most elegant way that journey has actually brought me more fully into life than i could have imagined so my passion for death is that has actually brought me more fully into life than i could have possibly imagined so i have a deep deep fascination interest in death dying thanatology to me really the whole spiritual path is death in slow motion opening titrating opening on our terms but will you say our share at the end i thought was so beautiful just to expand we said here that i in a certain way i couldn't wait to die that i i couldn't wait to return to my beloved but let me let me ask you this how do you think why what do you expect will happen and why do you think somehow you'll be more prepared for her ultimate embrace with the dissolution of your body at the moment to death than you are now i mean are you perhaps again i don't know kidding yourself it's a very open question what is the intuition or the felt scent that says i can't wait to dissolve into the embrace of the beloved at the moment of death and then why why do you think you'll be able to handle that any differently than you can handle it now i don't think i would handle it differently at the moment of my final death whenever that takes place then i could handle it now i think if i were to die right now the training that i went through in my psychedelic work and it is just as you say it it is a training to die and that training actually becomes a training in how to live because you know that there's like two realities in the world there's a domain of light i think of it as just pure light and then there's the green reality which is manifest physical world which is the world of of you know the world that we are part of near monaco so there's dharmakaya and near monacaia and they they are interpenetrating they are the same reality experienced in different modalities and what we experience as death is really just a a an intersection of a moment of intersection between these realities and as you awaken you don't you awaken into a deeper into the fact of the constant intersection the constant simultaneity of these realities so what happens when we die physically and what happens when we die spiritually are really deeply one in the same in a way and i feel like in my sessions i went through i was taken into my own death process multiple times i i can't really count how many times i died and so i have a sense that i know the pathway well i read the literature about the bardo confusions that can distract us and prevent us from returning fully to dharmakaya when we die and i recognize that and i have i feel like i've dealt with many of those and i i i may be wrong you know we'll find out yeah find out the final exam right yeah but i have a sense that uh to me death is will be uh not only joyful as it is for everybody but easy yeah uh because i i don't feel a deep clinging to not only my personal identity but i don't feel a deep clinging to human existence or to time space um so and you're absolutely right all spiritual practice and i think of psychedelic practice as i try to do it as a spiritual practice you know a session i call them sessions not true a period of spiritual practice yeah um they are preparing you for that moment of death and if everything goes well yeah you do get to die before you die remember those who die before they die do not die when they die so that what would be lovely if i could experience what i think of as full liberation would be if she came to me while i was still in my body and i got to live in the death state yes i was alive in the physical state that's so beautiful and this is so important this this view alone can irrevocably radically alter our relationship to the end of life and transitioning and by the way we should make a deal with each other chris when i was reading your book i thought of the same thing that both the use of of the word psychedelic and death i think these are branding issues we need to rebrand these terms so every time i read psychedelic it was like impressed by this ridiculous conditioned button to that word and so i'm somewhat playing here but you should replace every instance of psychedelic with entheogen i should replace in my work of death and dying i'm really going to actively try to do this because death is such a reified ridiculous notion i'm going to do my best to every time i use that word as mindfulness to speech replace it with the word transition because otherwise death seems so final it's so solid and it's like this terrible monolithic thing yeah but no it's not you know what marie curie said beautifully he said nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood yeah and so what we're doing here is this tremendous understanding so i want to talk a little bit about this because this is so important for us well let me before we go in the next yeah let me just respond to something you said okay one of the things that i write about in the book in the diamond luminosity chapter is once you've died so many times and at so many levels of consciousness the very concept of death loses its meaning because you you learn you cannot die yeah the form you are can die everything about all your understandings and all your history can die but you cannot die yeah and at that point you know in in that diamond luminosity chapter when i made my first transition into the diamond luminosity the name of that chapter i gave that is the death state and the song which i sung in that chapter you know my my if you what we would usually call the the song of realization was the death state you know and it the death state is the awakened state it is the it is the reality state um yeah you're the very impression this is exactly the question i was going to ask you um that when you went through these repetitive openings releases and deaths it became easier in fact you became more familiar with it right the very tibetan word for meditation to become familiar with so it's only because again we don't we're not we don't understand it we're not familiar with it hence we fear it and so you die over and over and over you become more familiar with it you understand it you befriend it and you go oh my gosh this is just this natural state of openness that is only fearful in reference to the ego structure to the form which we're exclusively identified with that we're so afraid of letting go of so just i want to reinstate this yeah because it's just so important it becomes easier the more frequently you die in meditation or through these sashings or whatever the more familiar you get with it until it becomes like his online his kamapa said at the moment his transition in this beautiful interview two days before he died nothing happens nothing happened to get to that point to say with utter conviction nothing happens yeah unbelievable yeah yeah death becomes your best friend truly it becomes your best friend in your practice you're always looking for your best friend now i just want to qualify again a little bit just okay so the unusual scope though the hardest strip down that i went through in any of my sessions the most extreme you know destruction of was in the 70th session in the last the what i consider the last vision i was given in among many major visions and so uh at one level earlier and i had gone through so many deaths and they do get easier and you look forward to them and your embrace them and so on and so forth and yet i have to put that beside this particular phenomenon where the transition was not easy i i didn't resist it i gave into it but it was really extreme and that's because my session or the consciousness guiding my session was taking me into an extremely radical state of consciousness that was deeper into deep time than it had ever taken me before it was giving me one last culminating series of teachings that required an unusually large canvas and so it had nothing to do with personal enlightenment or personal ego death or something like that so once again um we always have to contextualize all of our observations in terms of the level of consciousness that we're working with but in general i think you're absolutely right the more you die the more comfortable you get with it but and and to be able to say as the karmapa did nothing nothing happens is to be uh in a cherished cherished state isn't it yeah and if we really understand that again returning to the narrative the contraction openness narrative if we truly understand and feel in our in our heart of hearts that when we die it's the ultimate grand opening right there we go it's the grand opening and if we understand that these are little miniature openings we become more familiar with those in our meditation state i mean how much of the path is letting go of identification to thought to body to exclusive identification with form it is absolutely death in slow motion and therefore towards the end of the life then we really actually have like you said it's a complete reversal of our normal fear now we actually have something to look forward to instead of going into the bardos looking through the rear view mirror that's what makes everything so painful we actually now have something to look forward to is the big unwind the big unwind the final exhalation the final openness which is absolutely fundamentally ecstatic it's this release into the into the beloved and so like this is so important and i love your languaging here of the return to the beloved um because if we have um this again in our heart of hearts if we know that we are going to return to the embrace of the beloved you're going to return to your lover at the moment to death and be held in this ultimate holding environment oh my goodness does that change our relationship to the end of life i am going to return to the embrace of the cosmic mother wow these are then you die as a sinner with a smile on your face instead of kicking and screaming and and making a really difficult transition so this cannot in my opinion be overstated because this will radically change the way we relate to old age sickness as i look down and this apparatus has served me pretty well for decades is starting to crumble yeah instead of oh crap it's oh wow yeah it's like whatever yeah it's the one wonderful joy and mercy of life that they it can't stop you from dying you know it's like the older you get every you get one foot closer to joy and ecstasy and the whole attempt to you know cryogenics to not die and to freeze the body that's just sort of so sad i mean it's just so terribly sad and and it's not you know yeah it's such that's why you know i taught near-death episode research for years in my courses along with reincarnation research and other things and over and over and over again when students when i went with students through this wonderful literature and they watched how those people's lives were totally changed their relationship to death was totally changed by their temporary experience of what's on the other side of death and having experienced the beloved in their own form of the beloved that had an experience of softening permanently their own fear of death and changing their expectations so this is you know this death research uh is really really a powerful psycho spiritual work i i couldn't agree more the work of of grayson and evan alexander and others who come back with these really remarkable stories and i think this also is worth reinstating that i i believe it's like i've never had an official nde but i've had what i call meditative ndes and to me it's like you don't have to have these over and over for them to change your life you just need one and it's because and i wonder if this resonates with you it's because they're so true they're so real that it just takes one to completely change the texture of your life and this is as you know um they are using these agents now to remove fear of death for people who are just terrified one sashing one session will completely open you to the point where all fear of death is done and over with that's no small gift as you say it people say well how do you know what you whether what you experienced was real maybe it was just a complicated hallucination or self-fulfilling prophecy and it's like no you know what reality feels like and this is more real than the physical real it is a hyper reality it's just its objectivity is unmistakable yeah and you don't have to you don't can't quibble with it don't need to argue with it don't need to question it's just it's obviously true exactly and then really again come back and come back to the contraction thing it is in fact egos ego's inability to digest metabolize that that then contracts against it and fights against it um it's a type of uh reducing that by i love huxley what huxley said the brain reducing valve that and on one level we need it because it's like you said we we don't have the capacity to be developmentally that open and so we on one level we need this type of reduction in order to survive but really i would argue that's what constitutes growth is reducing the reducing valve continuing to open until we can actually um become this ultimate openness and this and in that sense become the cosmos itself and so this ties into what we're talking about last time that i love what you thought about this that in order to become i don't remember your exact terms but something like in order to become one with the universe we first need to become one with the self and you could say they're the same right can you say a little bit more about that how that was um yeah kind of played out in your own experience because i think again this is where we go when we die right we we become nothing yeah simultaneously we become everything yeah well the experience was to become one with all of existence you know we would say to become one with god to become one with the universe to become one with one uh we can't do that if we're not one within ourselves if if we have unintegrated pieces of shadow or ego fragments or untouchable wounds or bruises so when you when you move into intimacy with life life itself brings these unintegrated pieces to the surface so you can make your peace with them and so you can reabsorb them so you can be become whole and coherent within your own being because how could you become one with life if you're not one with yourself and so it's not you know just these things develop synergistically the deeper your experience of oneness with the life the deeper your experience of oneness with yourself until they're stopped until these divisions just they disappear inside of yourself and i think one of the wonderful qualities we appreciate about awakened beings is their is their integrity is their oneness their sense of deep relaxation within themselves which is a a outgrowth of their intimacy with life itself and you know and isn't that isn't that fantastic the way it yet again this reiterates the process of reiteration itself that by learning to in fact embrace ourselves and again talk about practical my tree loving-kindness learning to in a certain way unite befriend every aspect of our usually disenfranchised spectrum of our being all the parts that we reject that we then throw into the unconscious mind that keeps a large part of the unconscious mind going and so therefore to me chris it's like when we understand the divine nature of reality which includes the divine nature of their own but the entire spectrum of my being that what without this framework would be considered the shadow elements the thing the parts of ourselves that we don't want to embrace that we that therefore we spend our lives in a certain very um sophisticated avoidance strategy if we understand through this few say yes befriend every aspect of your own being i mean again like with death this radically changes the way we relate to the unwanted so-called aspects of our own spectrum we're being right here and right now that we learn how to open open and say yes to whatever takes place and then that type of integration and i love this interjection of the integrity we feel people then leads to fundamental integration with the so-called outside world altogether yeah and one of the one of the last pieces of course well recognized in the spiritual traditions is the importance of giving up private enlightenment you know because that's just spiritual shadow so that the more you know everything you do for others is part of is your awakening and everything you do for yourself including trying to become enlightened uh it gets in your way yeah yeah yeah this again this brings the social nexus of the path into play which i love what you write about in your book that we tend to think and i think provisionally so if we look at the term hinayana in its kind of pedagogical approach there's a lot to be said about click start at home start where you are clean up with your stuff but the near but the near enemy of that is then you become a little bit myopic a little bit nearsighted and and for me i say this with is part of my path i mean on one level i'm the happiest one i'm down in my study writing being my nerd and on retreat but then like i did my long retreat by design with others you can't wake up without others and therefore then others become your path so the we aspect the social cultural aspect i think this is incredibly important i speak from my own experience because otherwise then the solitary um path the the the solitary realizing path can become a real trap that that again in the narrative of opening opening we then work with the people that press our buttons we've installed those buttons so that's interesting but bringing bringing you know i had a little run in this morning with the guy who cuts my lawn and i paid very close attention to that i i said oh first of all i capitulated to my habit patterns it was like oh crap there was that again and then as i stepped away for a second i said oh my gosh that was padmasambhava teaching me about patients and so to me as i come out and i come out of my really long three-year retreat my aspiration now is to enter lifetime retreat with this view that all these annoying again that's just my projection all these annoying aspects of my reality now those are my path and i love this because there's tremendous power and tradition and path is it's traditionally put forth but there's also colossal enemies and one of these is just that is that you i can only do this one all the atmospheric conditions are right in my own life right and as the world is going to crap right now i think this becomes a little bit more helpful for us to bring this kind of view to so-called unwanted experiences so that we can bring those onto our own path realizing that they are our path yeah yep so anyway it's like you're interviewing me i need to back up a little bit i get so excited i can't help myself with your permission chris i want to transition into what again i thought was um just such a dazzling section in your book let's talk a little bit more if you would about the the light the the diamond luminosity you mentioned several times early on this this phenomena of light this is to me among the most profound aspects of the whole shebang and so if if you can maybe walk us through your exploration of this light and how it worked with you on the path to introduce you to i think is this this fundamental kind of matrix of reality well this transition took place 15 years into my work so i had already gone through ego death i had gone through the ocean of suffering of collective suffering i had navigated through archetypal reality both the sort of platonic archetypes and um the tissue of our and of our species mind the tissue of the human psyche and then had been taken into this year of incredible blessings of of experiences of oneness of shunyata emptiness of self cosmic love primal void you know i felt profoundly existentially complete i mean i i felt like i had been asked to give something in the ocean of suffering work and i gave it and the universe had just rewarded me with just a cascade of blessings that left me feeling profoundly existentially complete i mean i had been given a deep experience of and a new understanding of reincarnation that transcended classical you know eastern understandings of reincarnation i had been taken into the birth of the diamond soul i've been given many visionary experiences of where humanity was going in the future human and i reviewed these things just to sort of give a context it and along the way i had experienced light many times in different modalities in different forms and then in the i came into a time when i went through yet one more a very very intense death process which took an entire session and then the next session i began immediately and trust transported into the fruition portion of the session in which i was taken into this light that was beyond any light that i had experienced before it dissolved into a luminosity that was absolutely spellbinding and intoxicating and in my notes i called it the death state because it i entered it in a form of dying which was uh an ultimate form of dying at a key point i was surrounded by a swirling circle a disc that had contained all the moments of my life and i would fall from the center into this circle and touch one of some aspect of my life and i would instantly die into the state of luminosity and then be brought back to the center and fall in a different direction touching another different set of experiences and as soon as i did i would instantly be taken into this death state and this went over and over happened over and over until eventually um there was no going and coming there was just a permanent abiding or at least a session abiding in this transcendent luminosity the death state uh i would say ecstasy and it's true but it's it's a different than earlier forms of ecstasy it just the the most striking characteristic of it for me was its clarity clarity clarity clarity i mean it was the context within which all thinking and all feeling took place but in itself it was hyper hyper hyper clear breathtakingly clear just took my breath away and i understood the teachings that even just touching something like this for one second dissolves thousands of years of wandering around in the shadows of samsara it and i as i came to understand it um this was what i understood to be extrasome sorry reality and a particularly intense version of extra samsaric reality at first i thought of it in terms of samboga kaya because of the extreme bliss of it but as i really went back to the sources and studied them more carefully i came to associate it with dharmakaya the clear light of absolute reality the next session when i went back of course all i wanted to do was get back into this condition i had no interest in exploring the other dimensions that i had gone into but i did wasn't taken back into this experience and uh i wasn't taken back for another year five more sessions very intense purification very intense kind of cleansing and healing other things going on and it was after a year that i went into the diamond luminosity for the second time and this is what happened over the next several years that it would take about a year of very very intense work and then i would die awake and again into the diamond luminosity the second time i went into the diamond luminosity was the deepest experience of it that i had any time in any of my sessions and it was in that deep immersion that i had my cosmological vision completely reversed and turned upside down i had the experience of a reality of light beyond the diamond luminosity light i were my field pivoted i saw a reality far far in the distance that was just exquisitely beautiful light a ray of light hit me and it completely shattered me uh and i called it the absolute light you know it was a light beyond even diamond luminosity and in that one second i understood that it's an infinite progression and i had to give up completely the idea of ever coming to some type of end state because always my spiritual tradition had taught me there were end states that's why i was doing this work to reach home or to become one with god or to become um you know one with the universe and some fundamental you know dissolve into the metacosmic void and i began to realize with that instant i realized no it's an infinite progression and death will keep coming back as long as you keep pushing because you're never going to reach the end of it at that point in the the next time i went into the death into the diamond luminosity and the fourth and final time i went into the diamond luminosity i wasn't going deeper into the diamond luminosity but the diamond luminosity was crunching itself more deeply into my being and all the lessons were shifting and pivoting around that it was dissolving the structure of my body and i could feel it crunching itself into my cellular makeup and in a very very intense physical detoxification purification processes and then this eventually culminated in uh the fourth session into the in the experience of giving me an initiation into the buddha nature into the pure nature of mind and i began to understand that that magnificent reality which has no beginning it has no end it always is always has been we never have stepped out of it we never step into it it is the it is the abiding foundation of all existence that is in a sense the embodied diamond luminosity it is it is the closest i've come to uh to experiencing what diamond luminosity is like in the body my other experiences of diamond luminosity were diamond luminosity as they exist as an extra physical reality an extra some sort of reality but this was an experience of pure light as the foundation of my very physical existence okay that was the last time i experienced the diamond luminosity from there i went through a couple of experiences then the final vision in the 70th session and then basically the the consciousness guiding my work wrapped it up gave me a last set of instructions and sent me on my way oh i just want to take 15 seconds to pause and just digest that a little bit um [Music] i understand i've been digesting it for 20 years because the ineffable and enormity of it it this this it's a wonderful is you're sharing this with me chris and by the way thank you so much for trusting to do that i i find this very interesting dance between kind of the mythical poetic aspect of my being and rendering just bathing in the artistry of what you shared versus okay formulating whatever um in terms of my references and so i mean on one level i i'd almost hesitate to say anything because what can one say without just kind of literally watering it down distorting it but but with your understanding chris of of buddhist nomenclature because i i remember in your book you also shared somewhat interesting synchronicity won the diamond lucid luminosity was introduced to you in this way literally almost same same day kind of thing the vajrayana then became part of your journey and your path and so using that languaging is very interesting for me when you say these things i i find it very very interesting humbling exploration of of my referencing um in real capacity or lack thereof to understand it okay like for instance oh that sounds like the dharmaka oh that sounds like the dharma dhatu and i really hesitate to say that because on one level you i think you understand it shrink wraps the enormity of what you're saying into these names but on another level we can sit here in silence or we can do the best we can with language to talk about something that transcends language and so we do we can't yeah so with that said would you would you would you resonate with your understanding of the buddhist tradition and descriptions of of someone analogous states clear light mind is that another quality that comes in that could say this you use the term diamond luminosity interesting vajrayana is the diamond path but using and again without any violation of your own personal experience are there other um tibetan languages or buddhist terms that would relate to what you experienced that you could say that really sounds like the dharma dhatu you've used dharmakaya before but again i'm trying to simply relate using my reference structures to what you're sharing i'm yes i'm there are i mean clear light mind to me is maybe closer to uh the nature of mind in term that quality and this is i still i still am digesting i'm still trying to appreciate some of the differences between the diamond luminosity as an extra some sorry reality and then the diamond luminosity as at the foundation of pneumonicala existence uh so there certainly are many correlations and uh again all honor to the great beings who have explored these dimensions much more deeply than i've been able to so i mean always always a humble student truly humble student of the great teachers in this respect uh i put the names as best as i can to clarify or to qualify but you're right i mean it's tricky because you can this can get shrink wrapped and that just stops the mystery and just lets the mind back in where it really doesn't belong so let me just give this a step into a little different framework the universe is 13.7 billion years old our planet is about four and a half billion years old when we plot the the evolving structure of homo you know we go through homo erectus homo sapiens you know the various stages we got the big brain the 50 increase in our brain about a hundred thousand years ago uh self-awareness begins to emerge you know along the way and about three to five thousand years ago we began to develop the technology the spiritual technology that allows us to concentrate our minds and bring us down into that part of our being where we are not of the private self but we touch the life of the world we touch that which is universal and there's this tremendous aha this awakened sense and we've applied all sorts of names to that experience of our true nature our essential nature now what whatever this is and i think you and i have a pretty good sense of what that experience is what this is it is the tip of the iceberg of the unfolding the intentional exquisite unfolding of this trance extraordinary consciousness that we might call divinity or maybe not want to call it divinity uh this unfolding which has been gestating in creation for 13.7 billion years and that's only in this big bang we don't know how many other expansions and contractions of earlier universes precede this particular big bang explosion we don't know i mentioned this just to underscore the enormity the profoundness of the reality within which awakening takes place and the reality within which even deeper and deeper and deeper awakenings take place as have been recognized by our spiritual traditions our spiritual additions are only three four five thousand years old and that's a lot of time for an incarnating soul to to penetrate into the deeper texture of existence but if we were to go forward in time a hundred thousand years and that's a wink of cosmic time but if we went forward a hundred thousand years surely reasonably we would expect our great spiritual teachers to be having deeper experiences of the universe than our best spiritual teachers today are capable of having because it's it's an ongoing developmental process of exploring the deep mystery so on the one hand i want to honor and affirm the categories and descriptions of the beings who have lived up to this point in time and i place my experiences at their feet and i i seek their guidance and understanding what has taken place but just as the absolute light came from a reality far beyond whatever the diamond luminosity is likewise evolution is continuing evolution is developing and we are nowhere near even 10 percent of human development and so i would expect an almost demand that we expect deeper and deeper and deeper capacities for spiritual experience to continue to emerge so on the one hand we want to use the categories to to help us hold on to illumine understand on the other hand we don't want to shrink wrap them we want to stay open and staying open in this way i think is to stay open into is to stay open to a deeper intimacy with the beloved to stay open to the light that is the light that gives birth to the world second by second that's real that's exquisite and what comes to mind again is this wonderful kind of fundamental archetypal narrative of openness where on one level the invitation here is an ideological openness that that we can very easily again the near enemy of tradition like you i have tremendous oh my goodness tremendous allegiance respect for tradition but if tradition isn't you know i think you understand this in the best sense of the word it isn't modernized without being edited and distorted then it can become ossified um you can reify even the tradition and then we become closed around our ideologies and belief systems and so what i hear you saying that i really appreciate is this idol ideological openness let's let's keep even open to that but chris if i might a a question of clarity and then um a few other things when you when you use the word extra samsaric that that is not a term that's in my common vocabulary what what do you mean when you talk about the light as extra do you mean post trans-samsaric what do you mean by extra samsaric i mean beyond the bardo beyond all the layers of the bardo beyond all samsara at a place where the patterns of cyclic existence have been eclipsed and my sense of it is that in between you know physical reality and the rhythms of physical reality when we die we enter into various patterns of bartle reality yes various spiritual states but eventually that has many many many layers thousands of layers but one can go beyond that in what is the nature of reality that's beyond the bardo existence yeah uh the buddha refused to describe it very wisely right it says you know just experience it for yourself and you know and my sense is that outside of that uh what happens in the upper bardo and the light gets brighter and brighter and brighter until you move into a world which is all light it's just all light and the quality of light is is it's different because it's trans bardo i mean all individualized existence and here i have to be careful because uh i for one do not see individuality as the enemy of spiritual awakening because when we stabilize deep deep spiritual awakening our individuality is limit liberated not extinguished so i don't want to say that in the domain of extrasome sorry luminosity there is no individuality but it is an extraordinarily um translucent or an extraordinarily transparent individuality yeah i'm going to make it a practice to just pause and work with my usually incredibly habituated reflex to fill the space after you make these amazing statements because i want to rest in in the somatic impact of what you're sharing and not capitulate to my usual intellectual contractive predispositions which i don't think pay respect and honor to what we're trying to discuss here um but let me ask you this chris so when this is very interesting i mean there's so many very profound principles being explored and even challenged here so i'm wondering how what you're sharing with this and i was i was probably a surprise when i read this as you were when you experienced it the the dissolution of the so-called omega point that there isn't some final destination um and i'm wondering how you might reconcile or balance what you experience as this endless evolutionary unfolding with things so speak quorum quote like the changeless nature and and the reason i mentioned this is one way that i've played with this and again wonderful to be open challenged along these fronts is that on one level emptiness in this case emptiness is dharmakaya emptiness doesn't evolve form evolves and so i'm wondering how that lands with you when when the buddhist tradition talks about buddha nature is changeless nature how can something change and evolve that doesn't have form that's an oxymoron form evolves not emptiness so how does that land with you how do you again it's like oh hey they we're getting down to the razor's edge of everything here so how do you is that a dissonance with you or where how do you play with that it's i don't feel it as a dissonance and it is a deep mystery which i don't pretend to have to fathom in any profound you know way so i'll just share a few bits and pieces [Music] on those occasions when i have relaxed into fallen into been drawn into the unchanging condition the unchanging reality the reality within which everything arises and passes away and it itself is uh not impacted at all it is it appears to be the fertile emptying the fertile void i want to hold back emptiness there the fertile void from with in which all uh existence springs now if we then step into the existence that springs from within this cosmic fertile emptiness or void what's happening and we just look at the big bang and we look at the magnificent story of the ex the explosion of energy and the congealing into matter and the formation of galaxies and the formation of solar systems and sun life and then emergence of life and the emergence of self and then self-awareness and so on and so forth clearly existence seems to be going somewhere and it seems to just delight in in the in form and the unfolding and complexification and making self-aware and awakening and and empowering and the the empowering of the soul as our former life memories become conscious and we wake up to our 100 000 year identity not just our 100 year identity so form is going somewhere and that which is driving form is going somewhere and it's it's just the magnificent creativity of the universe and that's why you know the mind of the universe because i didn't want to call it god and that's why i'm not too really comfortable with the word entheogen because that has theos and our understandings of god are so limited so i i yield into um the cosmologist language of the universe because we measure the universe in light years six million million miles and it's billions of light years across that bag that huge and yet when we right now as we become self-conscious as this you know complex biped and we drop our awareness down to the center of our self what we find is this magnificent reality which feels to be unchanging and yet it seems to be at the center of everything which is changing so it it seems to be clearly kind of a both end so the divinity if we use the word divinity for it the the divinity which delights in existence has at least and i don't know whether this is ultimately true because we may just be scratching the surface even now but its nature that infinite nature that it seems to be at some level unchanging at the center perpetual change and that's kind of the best i can do about it i think it's fantastic and it's again completely revelatory of um conceptual frameworks just because um concept can't relate to this seeming paradox it doesn't mean reality doesn't abide by those paradoxes right it's only apparent it's only a paradox to the conceptual mind yeah it has no problem exactly exactly it's only when we try to shrink rapid that we enter into the world of paradox and irony and on one level to me this is beautiful because this is in fact one of the ways that i've come to register this marvelous dissonance isn't the right word but when when duality tries to open and wrap itself around non-duality which of course they cannot do one characteristic of that is in fact this irony paradox uh things that like the niels bohr i love what he introduced the notion of complementarity you know that phenomena can be it's not either or it's and they can be both light and particle we can you can be both chris beige and the cosmos who says you can't be both if aristotle says we can't be both you know we live in his and we live in his world and so one other really important thing for me here chris is there does seem to be we talked i believe very briefly about this last time i want to return to it because this is important to me in terms of path quality in fact very notion of path on one level there seems to be a suggestion in your languaging um in in what you're sharing here what you shared in your book this quality of return i i want to return to the beloved i want to return to the light longing to return and perhaps this also lies in with this whole notion of of paradox but i'm also wondering how we can play with that with what to me seems the more immediate aspect of this is a large part i mentioned this because this is a big part of my current path is is really decimating the notion of path itself that how fair is it in fact to say the issue of return is a provisional approach description and then perhaps a more absolute approach would be around recognition that you're not you don't really need to return to anything the the issue is recognition and self-liberation so does that somehow speak to you when when you reference longing to return to the mother to the beloved to the clear light that again denotes this subtle dualism i have to return versus no i just need to remove the cataracts of confusion open the aperture of my heart and mind and the there the light the mother is right in front of me right now yeah i absolutely i think that's a fair observation return implies um absence and the nature of union dissolves absence and so it dissolves the category of return and it encourages a different set of categories because uh it's like the eternal here the eternal now it's just here all the time and so i i think that's absolutely true that it's a it is it fits at one level but then it dissolves itself at a deeper level now having said that again i want to contextualize this within my particular journey which is not the same as the journey of spiritual awakening so the journey of spiritual awakening is this art and craft of awakening into releasing all the constrictions of the present self so that we can live in a state of an abiding transparency or shunyata to life as it flows through us like wind blowing through the trees and we simply we rest in the abiding present of the universe as it continues to unfold cosmological exploration is different it's kind of like getting into a rocket ship and going into a different at a different solar system in the galaxy maybe even going into a different galaxy altogether and and that is pushing the the capacity of experience pushing the limits of awareness so that the condition of remembering reaches beyond even the nature of mind it's not about simply if if i were had been seeking only to awaken into the abiding present i would have adopted a completely different strategy i think i think myron stilleroff's recommendation of working with very very low doses of lsd in meditation practice would be a better strategy but the the strategy i used working with very very high doses of lsd pushes consciousness so far beyond enlightenment and and i say that humbly trying not to confuse the categories not like i'm enlightened and i'm more than enlightened not like that at all but it's going beyond the state of the abiding condition of emptiness into the unchanging reality underneath it's going deeper into physical reality deeper into consciousness reality where does consciousness come from what are the prototypes that inform the very structure of time and space the prototypes that inform the nature of of um archetypal consciousness within the human psyche what are what are the very forms that uh that are giving birth to time and space what is the light that gave birth to the world not just the gave birth to our moment to moment exhaustion but the light that gave birth to the universe from that condition there is a sense of return entering that condition and then coming back from that condition and that's why i i think what you say is absolutely true within a spiritual context as we usually mean spiritual return as an oxymoron it's better to use other categories but from within a context of cosmic exploration maybe there's a place because i personally cannot imagine how i could personally maybe other beings could and can and god bless them but i cannot imagine how i could personally live in some of the places that i have touched and so i can only visit them as a as a visitor as a sojourner and so i come back and i try to bring back as much as i can i try to cultivate whatever i can of that condition in my daily life but i know that the vast majority of that reality i will never be able to bring back in this lifetime maybe a hundred lifetimes from now maybe so i don't know but i will never be able to and therefore in that context return has a certain ring of truth to it wow with again several things that come to mind here um and again i i you're a philosopher uh it's interesting this is a very compelling term for me um i think in many instances things become philosophy because they haven't become direct experience yet so then we use that slight pejorative thing that's philosophy and so what you're sharing here is is really quite something and i wouldn't say this is this this is simply to discuss it i almost said the word challenge it but that's not the right word to discuss this that what comes to mind and so educate me teach me are again i i'm completely um admissive of of my frameworks because i honestly unless i sit here in silence i don't have a choice right silence is the language of god all else is poor translation yeah i'm a poor translator but i'm doing my best so when you something that that rubs me and i love the rub because that's what creates the pearl how do you reconcile teach me um when you talk about this this difference and this is foundational for you but it does challenge me when you talk about in fact the difference between the individual versus the cosmic because let's let's take for instance the reference point that does speak to me chris that that i'm finding some refuge in here that maybe is limited of advaita vedanta for instance that how do you reconcile the duality that's inherent in your statement that separates individual from cosmological because if in fact you're saying that that dil still does imply a duality and so for me i i'm wrestling playing dancing with this idealistic i'm you know in buddhism as you know chittamatra yogachara the world is his heart mind spirit there you're what you're saying here seems to intimate still some other cosmological versus individual and so how do you work play with that in terms of the the what you were talking about earlier reconcile that with oneness now because on one level i seem to hear a monism for you yeah but now you're talking about dual aspect modeism again i feel like i think you understand it on one level it's like oh please don't don't become a philosopher again yeah right yeah here i am you're talking about such beautiful stuff and here i am you will aspect modernism oh please just go away but i i want to understand this a little bit more so that when i leave this i'm not merely left with a wonderful which is probably the best this wonderful transmission from your experience but how do you play with that is there in fact an inherent cosmological dualism when you say individual versus cosmic versus the monism that you seem to suggest throughout your journey yeah i think i don't see any dualism in it and if there is a dualism it's not of my making it's of the universe is making the universe begins as one in some fundamental core you know pre-big bang instant big bang it begins this one and it manifests diversity i didn't choose that you didn't choose this we didn't choose it the universe chose to manifest diversity we are part of that diversity and the universe chose to empower in its process of self-emergence it chose to empower life to become self-aware and self-empowering so re the soul grows and grows and grows the soul is that consciousness which holds the awareness experience of all of our lifetimes multiple lifetimes so we're expanding we're growing and growing and growing we didn't choose that we didn't make ourselves we are discovering a world that was designed before we even billions of years before we even showed up on the scene so we show up in the scene and we begin to try to make sense of it and we begin to try to understand these things and one thing is very clear that there is a part and there is a whole there are many many parts and there is there is the whole and when when our spiritual experience deepens we have experiences of the whole and at the same time we experience ourselves as a part and how do we reconcile those i think we reconcile them with a deep understanding of emptiness and emptiness here is simply emptiness of self that when we open to the wholeness of life it's immediately obvious that there is no separate self we are part of life we are an abiding part of life we are a bubble in the ocean we are part of the process that's why to me oneness and emptiness are two different sides of the same coin it's simply the experience that i'm living in breathing every molecule of my being every thought of my being every consciousness every soul everything i am is part of the manifestation of the universe i am the universe in that respect and yet i'm obviously just a little bitty part a little bitty planet a little bitty solar system in a galaxy within multiple building two trillion galaxies so we are part and we are we are our nature is the is the totality of the whole in that respect there is no duality except the duality which is forced upon us by the conditions of life but there's no ontological duality there's a functional duality but i i don't even like to use philosophical categories of metaphysical categories because that traps us within human thought in the history of human thought and the history of human thought particularly in the western philosophical tradition is so constrained it it is not rooted in deep experience it's rooted in sensory experience and highly intellectually refined sensory experience which is why i think of course when we turn the to the contemplature traditions different philosophical insights emerge or different insights emerge because it's a deeper experience and i think that's the significance of psychedelics for the west as a philosopher they not only give us new clinical categories and clinical insights and opportunities to heal the personal psyche but as a philosopher they open up the entire world of cosmic experience and so as we try to digest those experiences and articulate them and understand them it it allows us to draw from a deeper set of experiences which allows us to basically entertain a deeper set of ideas so i i i have a training as philosophy of religion and i point to that only to differentiate myself from the good psychologists who are working in clinical context but i don't speak like a philosopher do i and and i i don't do the things that philosophers do and they would disown me in a minute they all they do disown me you know so to me there's no duality there's a functional duality which is basically just a bubble on the ocean of time in existence that that's a incredible response to basically a very subtle thorny issue one question chris from the very outset is when you had the experience of the diamond diamond luminosity post sashing post meditation where does that light go what is the relationship of that light to the phenomenal display of the world and appearance does the world emerge from that light is the world an expression of that light or both so so you you seem to not seen you you entered return to a luminosity state and when you so to speak came down came out of it this world appeared what is the relationship of the discovery of that light to the perhaps covering up or that's my languaging where does that light go and how is it what is its relationship to appearance yeah good question which i'm not competent to answer but i i take some pointers from science and some pointers from my experience the light doesn't go anywhere of course the light is always there we gain access to it for a period of time but uh we withdraw from the light into you know plato would say the world of shadows but to me that denigrates the beauty the magnificence of physical reality scientists tell us that all over the world is made of molecules molecules are made out of atoms atoms are made out of subatomic particles ultimately we get down to quarks in the end matter is made out of light yeah correct so if the scientists are telling us that matter is made out of light and if we go into our mind and drop into the deepest levels of our mind and we encounter light it's like well you know there's that this is such a synergy there so my understanding is that the light of doesn't disappear the light is manifesting the physical world the light is manifesting as the physical world that means when we really sit with the whole trying to hold it all together we get to experience the physical world as the manifestation of the unified being of being which is light it manifests and everywhere we touch the world we find genius in the creation of solar systems and how stars live and die and in dna and in ecosystems everywhere we're touching the world we find layers and layers and layers of genius and if we keep digging down deep enough we'd fall into quantum reality you know dark energy dark matter light they call it dark energy dark matter but it really should be light energy light matter you know light light light yeah so it if i live if i get depressed and i live in a state of sadness i related live in a state of disconnection then that's only that's only my own mind throwing up shadows of illusion but when i'm clear when i return to clarity i see the world as a miracle yeah manifestation and i love that the prophet muhammad said that the only miracle he would cite for the truth of what he was teaching was the miracle of the universe in in isn't it worth again i'm sure you know this but perhaps it's worth just re reinstating that when you say i experience it perhaps it experiences itself right there on one level yes we use that languaging but even then it's almost it's it is impossible um to talk about this without stumbling into this it's it's this as you know reflexive awareness of the light itself and so yeah i'm wondering chris is it fair to say that then i i'm i'm i mean this is so integral to the whole thing it's literally enveloped in the term enlightenment this is a big deal and and so i i of all the teachings both in in physics cosmology and spirituality the ones that captivate me the most that that i find the most ineffably profound are in fact these teachings of luminosity which inseparable from emptiness is emptiness luminosity is it is it fair to say that that what we know is our self-sense when we condense and contract from the unity i'm using my languaging here please correct me if i'm wrong from the unity of that formless light back into a reified form in the worlds that that arises from that contraction that that that's a process of dissociation that on one level we again again the narrative of openness when we completely open die to reality it reveals itself in this undifferentiated ineffable unity of of light and that when we can condense reincarnate back into form the minute we do that the world appears as self another and we simply lose memory we lose the recollection of this this fundamental um expression of the beloved as as this body of infinite luminosity and emptiness i think there is a a sad way of doing that and then there's a happy way of doing that or so maybe there's a pathological way but then there's an entirely healthy way and imagine it this way i mean let's use god language temporarily just because it's kind of handy uh if if we were to become one with god for an hour and if god is the essence and totality of all life forms then we would be becoming one with all life forms and just imagine the nearby life forms in your neighborhood that that would involve becoming one with all the beetles and ants and grasses and seeds and cockroaches i mean all the human beings and all their manifest forms there's so many layers and layers and layers and layers of life so when we say about well we're becoming one with god we don't really mean oh my god we became one with the billions and billions of ants that are you know right in my neighborhood but in fact if god is one if all life is one in god then that's what it involves so what happens i think is that we do become one with one we kind of re connect to the one but the happy way is that when we come back i don't come back into being an ant i don't come back into being a toad or bird i come back into being chris a human being and there is a happy and healthy way in which i come back into this individual life form which recognizes that its essence is the same as the essence of those ants and birds and toads no better no different it's more complicated but the essence is the same there is that profound kinship with all of existence i happen to be a human bubble they are other kinds of bubbles together we make up the unified existence of the totality less seeing in celebration we work together we didn't choose it we didn't create it we are awakening up within it it is the design of a deeper intelligence a deeper organization that's that's manifesting itself in joyful diversity we we can enjoy the diversity we can acknowledge it and be comfortable within it and i don't think there's anything pathological about it in fact there's an ecstatic joy in celebrating being a human being in the in the now if we exalt our humanness at the expense of other life forms and we're willing for them to go extinct in order to allow us to buy a bigger you know bigger and better and whatnot of course there's a steep deep pathology there but when it's truly liberated our our individuality is recognized as a gift just an extraordinary gift and a responsibility we have to handle that responsibility in order to protect the well-being of all the life-forms that we are part of that that are around us then the deep the sense of our common ground the sense of the common ground out of which all life emerges i think deepens and deepens and deepens uh and so i don't really this is again a sort of eco-psychology and eco-spirituality we can't really awaken as a as a separate self without simultaneously awakening as an earth self an earth being yeah that's that's fantastic and talk about applicability sometimes it's easy to think that these are kind of elite treasured sterile ivory tower spiritual experiences but really these there's nothing more practical more applicable this this is the farthest from being philosophy this is the most radical transformation in view from which activism whatever you want to call it enlightened activity extraordinarily practical applicable behaviors and actions arise spontaneously from this and i think this also cannot be overstated because to me my big bug these days if if what we're discussing here is it can't be of a benefit to what's happening in the world it's irrelevant and this is far from irrelevant this is this is absolutely foundational for this is right view it is the basis that which you from this from this foundation spontaneously without thought arises the activity that is is appropriate for this day and age and so chris as we um wow let me ask you this when i when i hear you you talking about these experiences these are these are types of samadhi states you're you're entering into particular absorption states like when you're bathing in the light you become the light that's a type of that's a luminous samadhi why does it end why why why does post-meditation post sashing still take place why why not abide in that light eternally um what brings what's what brings you back and it seems on a level it's involuntary right so in a certain way we're talking about rebirth processes what is the rebirth process involuntary due to the unpurified habitual patterns that still bring us back because of their karmic power why why does the samadhi end yeah well once again there are some beings for whom their samadhi does not end but even those beings experience a movement in and out you know they they live at different levels at different seconds of every hour i would say my samadhi ends because i'm not i'm a being who cannot sustain those levels of purity or those levels of clarity in my current condition so the habits of consciousness reassert themselves the habits of my embodiment reassert themselves and i once again am kind of looking at the world through the levels of awareness that i can manage in my embodied existence but in a sense there is a again we spirit is the goal spiritual awakening or is the goal cosmological exploration if the goal is spiritual awakening then there is a way in which we can realistically aim to enter into a kind of samadhi which is abiding and allows us to live with a profound sense of freedom within the context of life if the if the experiential trajectory is cosmological exploration then the burden of that at least as in this path that i practice and i'm just let's just stay there and not talk about the comparative other paths the burden of that discovery is that it's temporary the burden is that it's a samadhi state or maybe even samadhi is not the right word for it to go beyond to experience the future to experience the future of humanity in a realistic graphic sense to experience the purpose of time-space existence and a profound expansion of time that allows you to span millions and millions of years of history and understand and absorb it and to take it in i mean i don't how could one possibly live in that condition and have breakfast really so that's just you know if you want to understand those things here's a way of doing it but then you have to you have to come back and now you have to live in my 72 year old self and i have to cut the grass and i have to do my things uh and that's okay because if if you do it well there is a happy way of coming back and integrating and recognizing the limits of what you experienced it's a temporary condition no big deal not to make too much of it learning more as i go you know just so there's a there's a healthy way and then there were all sorts of unhealthy ways of doing it but hopefully healthy way it is there is an abiding calm and trust an abiding trust in the wisdom of the universe in its self-emergent glory yeah would it be fair to say chris therefore that i mean i i hear rebirth reincarnation we're basically talking about this fundamental process is it fair to say that rebirth really takes place in two dimensions of experience the degree of openness we can tolerate um in other words what what there thereby can bring the end of and this is important term for me that differentiates my understanding of buddhism from other traditions what ends the process of involuntary rebirth is in fact the ability to coming back to this central narrative of openness to open open open open to such a due degree you were so familiar with it we're so comfortable with it that fundamentally when that state is revealed at the moment of death we we abide in and as that fundamental openness and then when we do return as you know we do so out of love and manifestation of compassionate cuckoo phenomena voluntarily embodying our wisdom not involuntarily embodying our confusion and at that point it's not that rebirth ends involuntary rebirth ends and just like you said then the play lilo rolpa continues infinitely out of love and compassion in the service of others is that a fair way to share or express your understanding of of this again i'm trying to to dance around um the dissolution of the omega point right that this is the final goal but on one level yeah on one level it is a the final goal for self the the cessation of that self but then it's just the beginning of this endless voluntary display of wisdom and i think it's a very fair description i think what ends is the involuntary nature of reincarnation and we transition into voluntary incarnation and with that comes i mean and i think we our future incarnations are not the same as our past incarnations in this respect and the way i've languished this the way it was shown me in the sessions is that long term or short term i mean in long term however it manifests itself intermittently um i think in the end we all become tulkus we all become voluntarily incarnate the hum when the entire planet is populated by self-consciously incarnated beings humanity will have transitioned to a new level of its evolutionary trajectory and the way this was presented to me in the sessions was the re the birth of the diamond soul so all my former lives at one point started coming into me coming into me and when they hit they hit a critical mass and they fused into one and when they fused into one this diamond light blew out of my chest and catapulted me into a deep deep deep state of consciousness that was individualized it was individual consciousness but it was individuality actualized in a way that i had no previous experience of and i think that that's where humanity is going all of us are incarnating every generation billions and billions of people are incarnating incarnating over and over again over and over again sooner or later the entire species not only becomes awakened but the entire species gives birth to this deeper spiritual awareness which has been gestating inside it all of this time all these hundreds and hundreds and thousands of lifetimes until we awaken into our deeper awareness which is not just the awareness of enlightenment the awareness of awakening but it's the awareness of our history it's the awareness of our relationship to the universe it's a deeper intimacy with the intelligence of the universe the deeper intimacy with all life forms on this planet this is when soul consciousness and i don't mean soul in a anti-buddhist way but in a way that's compatible with shunyata emptiness but soul consciousness awakens so that we awaken to the being that we are in the community of beings as they are on a planet at this particular stage of its evolutionary development with billions of years ahead of us and so i i think we're just beginning to see the edges when we first encountered enlightenment 5 000 years ago we called it um escape moksha we escaped samsara we want to get out of here but now we're beginning to understand now we want to awaken here and in the awakening here we humanity makes a pivot into a new stage of the evolutionary story and a not not just a larger stage but a more peaceful stage peaceful of heart non-violent more compassionate more insightful more creative that's the kind of planet that i think we're giving birth to right now and all of our individual spiritual aspirations and and pure purification aspirations and healing aspirations and justice aspirations all of this are all organically part of this deeper story and the deeper stories that humanity is coming to a point where it no longer has the liberty of living at the lower level of maturity that it's lived at in the past we cannot afford we can't run a planet run by egos we have to grow up and when we grow up we grow up into this higher form of spiritual awareness that the spiritual teachers have been telling us about for thousands of years but this begins a turning point in human history that's what we're trying to give birth to what i call the future human people give all sorts of different names to it we can all feel it in our bones it's maitreya it's that higher level of realization that is working its way to us you know that's really really exquisite and i'm wondering um if again i understand the languaging but i'm wondering if um growing down might be a more appropriate embodied aspect because the growing up is again fundamentally moksha escapist fedex my consciousness to appear land when it's really waking down into the majesty somewhat nice way to start to close things up with the integration of your work the waking down bringing metabolizing digesting incorporating literally incorporating bringing into soma body yeah this this vast realization but chris if if you don't mind me being slight devil's advocate here that's just from my stance sure i i've become very interested fascinated for some decades with development structural development not just not just spiritual and this is where i like integral approaches and so i i i take utter complete delight in this vision and make aspirations that may it be so that we can all become cuckoos um but i'm also wondering again wishful thinking you talk in your book about these evolutionary breakthroughs um when i look at the world and i i i see what's happening and we can't even agree as a society to wear a mask for the benefit of each other why why should there be at this point something special that would occur like a meteor hitting this earth of sanity wisdom and insight that would shake us from our collective slumber and bring us to this collective evolution and awareness it doesn't seem to work that way evolution stumbles and trips along these very painful laborious long stretches of time i i revel in what you're saying but i'm less optimistic than i used to be that i look at this world and i put my finger up to the winds that are blowing and it doesn't it's not blowing in the right direction yeah things don't be getting worse they seem to be getting raised right so i'm curious outside of of your experience and that that's ultimate refuge for you what else outside of that if there is anything else gives you the conviction to say that that we're heading towards this evolutionary breakthrough as a species um can like the big question these days will we do it in time i personally am not so sure i try to retain my optimism yeah but it's conjecture on my part so i'm curious how that that challenge slash rub lands with you the development doesn't seem to work this way yeah outside of my visionary experience i have nothing to say i you know we all look at the data we all see what's going on we see the stupidity and insanity around us we see a growing eco crisis series of eco crises we anticipate the desertification of the middle america we see phantom famine on the horizons already started but penetrating into middle class experience slowly we see the we're told that the oceans a 12-foot rise has already baked into the into reality uh unstoppable by 2050 12 feet by 2050 where we can calculate how many billions of people will be flooded out of where they live and where i mean we know we're coming into extremely difficult times we see the forces of conservatism we see the reactionary regressive forces that are manifesting in politics internationally we see higher concentrations of wealth into smaller and smaller numbers of people we see very very dangerous and forbidding trends and and so outside of my visionary experience i have no uh certainty or surety that this is going someplace good so the nature of my experiences if there and if there is any well the nature of my experience is that starting about around 1992 93 i started having these consistent visions coming in completely by surprise just as i had not anticipated that one could possibly do any type of therapeutic work and healing some aspect of the collective psyche i had no idea that it was even possible to consider having insights into humanity's evolutionary trajectory but now once i lived with this for years i began to understand that this is a natural thing just as we have as we go deeper within our personal life we have a deeper understanding and experience of our trajectory of our personal life one can go deep if one lives in service of the collective one can have a deeper and penetrating understanding of the collective trajectory and in that context my experience has been consistent over years and years and years of psychedelic experience and visionary experience first many years of basically saying humanity's coming to a turning point we're coming to a before and after we're coming into a to a dawn of something fantastic we're coming to a genuine spiritual awakening that everything that he our spiritual traditions have been describing for the individual guess what it's not an individual thing it's a collective thing this is a collective dynamic the forces of the collective unconscious are activated not just my personal unconscious and then at that critical time in 1995 when i had the 55th session and it and it when i was expecting to be taken back into the diamond luminosity it dissolved me into the collective psyche it dissolved me into the collective unconscious took me into deep time into an expanded sense of time and in that state i experienced the death and rebirth of humanity i experienced a global systems crisis that led to billions of people billions of people dying just a total unraveling of cultures we have known it of civilization as we've known it a complete i i experienced our entire species losing control of its story losing control of its life on this planet just being put under enormous terribly crushing pressure of death and destruction and it looked for time it felt for a time as this this was an extinction event that we were really going extinct as a species but and i was given no details i wasn't giving a timeline i wasn't given anything i was given the experience of the species going through a death event on this planet all of us together and then i experienced that the storm began to pass the storm began to subside and those of us who were still alive picked themselves up and began to rebuild and what we were was different than what we had been before and what we be what began to happen was a synergistic of conscious creativity a synergistic of compounded freedom a synergy of compounding insight a new set of values a new set of understandings a new set of capacities were manifesting themselves that humanity as a whole was going through a process that every spiritual aspirant has had knowledge of a complete collapse of realities they had known it and a waking up into a more spiritually animated whole magnificent beautiful conscious awareness that humanity was going through this process and then in the very in my 70th session the very very last session once again it gave me kind of like a capstone experience where it took me deep into the future and it showed me the archetypal structure of this future human the archetypal form of it and truly i mean it brings tears to my eyes just to even remember it to think of it that this is a this is a truly different form of humanity it's like the best of the best of us in it our hearts healed our minds opened outside of my visionary experience i have no reason for suggesting what i have suggested as that humanity is coming to this turning point this evolutionary pivot point i know that evolution has dead ends and you know whole species die off and whole planets could die off and i know that there's no cognitively compelling reason for having hope and as we enter the next century as we enter what's going to happen in this century we are going to lose hope again and again and that's why i think it's really important to have a vision an understanding of what's taking place at a deeper level because it's going to get bad i mean really realistically we could be looking at more than half of the human population of earth lost and we'll watch it on television every night and it's just it's going to rack us with terrible pain but inside we're going to be led to do things that we would not otherwise do we're going to be we're going to be cracked open in this pain and suffering justice and of meditation deep meditation justice and deep psychedelic experience we will reach deeper into ourselves than we have ever reached before and we will accomplish something that we might never accomplish without this ordeal of pain now the other thing that i was shown in the 55th session was some of the mechanism responsible for doing this that was and i was shown this over and over and over again taken through it and it until i it was made sure i understood it and i'll just mention it here and point to the book and that is it has to do with the functioning of the collective psyche and in this time of accel accelerated and intensified individual suffering it's not just our individual psyches that would be activated but all of the suffering of humanity gathers in its process at a centralized level as more as morphogenic feel childreak has helped us understand and so that the scenario that was unfolded was the collective psyche will move into such a highly energized state that it will begin to operate as a non-linear system are far from equilibrium system and we know something about how physical systems operate when they enter into non-linear conditions they are capable of accelerated change small perturbations ex produce expanded outcomes uh creativity emerges from within the system in unprecedented way hydrogen and oxygen combined to produce oxygen i mean to produce water uh things happen that are un anticipatable according to a system operating in linear systems and this was shown me that this future is going to take place this pivot is going to take place much faster than we could ever imagine if we used our calculation based upon the past it's going to take place faster more quickly it's going to be deeper than anything that we could imagine in the past now i i know that sounds like optimism run amok and i understand and everybody has to make their own decisions on this all i can do is simply hear report the vision and let it go with that and then we're all in this together you and i and our children and grandchildren we're all in this together yeah yeah i mean it's interesting part of me um says may it be so and another part of me says may it not be so hmm but i'm wondering chris as we start to to wrap up i know your time is valuable we've covered so much amazing material really and [Music] um prescriptions what what uh level some some things are implied with our time together but um prescriptions what what to do or in a certain sense not to do how to bring our individual empowered selves or lack thereof to to actually help this world both now and and you know for our ancestors so some let's let's end on some prescription notes if we might in terms of the transition that i've been describing someone that i know and love and respect very dearly who has thought a great deal about what we can do how we can accelerate this process how we can remove the worst of the pain and move into the this new future better quicker is dwayne elgin and his book choosing earth is a beautiful book powerful book small book he lays out what he thinks the next five decades are going to look like and it's not a pretty picture it's it's a frightening picture but he also lays out a series of prescriptions of prescriptions for how we can engage this future how we can bring about a safe landing how we can change and engage socially individually and socially and i i think he his advice is worth much more than mine dwayne elgin choosing earth and he's giving the book away you can get a pdf on amazon it's giving he's giving it away because it's so important uh he's not trying to hold on or make money on it himself he's it's all in service of humanity i would step also add to that a reminder that from a reincarnational perspective each one of us every one of the thousands and thousands of listeners in your program and all of us around the world we chose to be incarnated at this time in history we chose to be incarnated at the time and place that we incarnated with the talents and challenges that we brought into this incarnation we are exactly where we are supposed to be in order to make a creative offering to this time in history we don't have to go look elsewhere the only real question is do we have the courage to actualize to activate the potential that we are standing on right here right now once we make that commitment that our life my life will count towards the good then we look around us and we say okay what needs to happen what what are we trying to become and then we put our hands to work and since we're all different and we all have different missions and different agendas some of us are in the medical field some of us in the political field and philosophical field and creative field and hard labor all these things every human talent will be required to bring this about so it's not a matter of kind of looking elsewhere it's simply a matter of looking at where one is already incarnated to make service spiritual practice is important facing the shadow clarifying the shadow becoming open and individually receptive community is important not only practice community but social community uh learning how to do more with less sharing restructuring society political communities really important we see what happens when ego runs amok in our politics all these things are needed all of these things are important all we have to do is look around and see what needs to be done and give ourselves to it completely wow wonderful wow um anything that um you wish i would have asked any any i don't know you covered some serious territory partner yeah that's been rich but as we really wrap up um i mean there's so many summary statements here but any any other final thoughts or questions you felt should have been directed your way no you know you mentioned the living classroom in the beginning and it's not it's too late to go into a large excursus but the basic the core of that book which doesn't mention psychedelics is the core truth that's manifesting there is that consciousness is unified from the start so that everything we do in our individual sphere our individual field radiates out around us 360 degrees it all of our spiritual practice all of our actions everything we do radiates around it touches and interacts with the consciousness of the beings around us knowing this then we take more responsibility for making sure we're sending out you know a positive experience in the world you know beneficial experience and we are never ever ever isolated from those around us we it may be invisible it may be subtle you know but it's always there and the more we act on that basis the more we activate the strength of those sinews that uh bind us to life and if this is true of course not just for human beings other human beings it's true for all the life forms that surround us and that that's the core teaching of the living classroom that there's an atomistic quality to teaching and then there's a quantum quality to teaching so like you and i have been having kind of a in some ways an atomistic conversation but we can trust that there's a quantum quantum quality to our conversation yeah yeah a field effect that is that extends beyond our our limited self sense which is illusory in in nature and when we have these i think it's a wonderful way to end because really it invites us to really discover that we have so much more power than we think in in both negative and positive ways and and the thoughts that we hold the aspirations the motivations it's not just encapsulated in this little ball of skin it it just it's a pebble radiating out throughout the cosmos not just this world and and i think really understanding that will empower our ways to benefit the world so chris yes i i can't thank you enough for spending so much time with us i it's really quite remarkable i'm thrilled to have spent this time with you i've learned so much i applaud your bravery your heart um your capacities and doing this it's marvelous and it's really being a great benefit so thank you for the conversation andrew uh thank you for your work bringing this conversation and many similar conversations into the world conversations change lives thank you for what you do and just thank you for the opportunity to talk about these things together it's been yeah it's been a delight for me too and like we talked briefly last time this this i haven't really thought of it before the dialogue the conversation the sharing is is actually a quality of path itself is new for me and i haven't really thought of it that way so it's a wonderful insight of many that you shared so um thank you so much for everything let's do it again with the next book that comes out oh no help me but i'm always happy to have a conversation with you yeah really yeah such a delight um until next time thank you so much for your time good heart loving blessings love and blessings thank you bye</p>

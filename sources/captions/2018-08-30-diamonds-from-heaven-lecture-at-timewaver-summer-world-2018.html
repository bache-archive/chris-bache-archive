      <p>Chris peshwa time for Troop sign Arizer ending guys deliver Azam's petition Marcus I want to thank you very much for the opportunity to be here today and for the opportunity to address the time waiver community which is certainly such a progressive and wonderful community Martin mentioned Stanislav Grof he's the one of the cofounders with Abraham Maslow of transpersonal psychology and he's the foremost authority of integrating LSD and other psychedelic substances into the therapeutic process when I first read realms of the human unconscious his first book I read it in 1979 I was a brand-new young junior faculty member at the University as soon as I read that book I realized that psychedelics would represent a turning point a pivot point not only in psychology but also in philosophy and I was trained as a philosopher of religion so I made the decision to begin a psychedelic voyage I was convinced that the most important work which would be done in the near future would be be done by people riding out of an experiential basis not simply an intellectual basis and so I began a process of doing that experiential work now I have to assume a certain familiarity with Stan Grof work I won't try to describe the methodology of working with psychedelics it's a very intense methodology it's not tripping and going to a concert it's working in very contemplative isolated circumstances isolated from the world with eyeshades going deeply within I did this work over 20 years over 20 years I did 73 high-dose LSD sessions using stan grof paradigm I worked for four years and then I stopped for six years which are not part of the store and then I worked very intensely for another ten years now to do this work I had to split my life in half on the outside I continued to be a university professor I gave my lectures I did the things that University professors do in my inner life I began this very intense journey and I I kept them separate I kept a firewall between the two I you couldn't I could not talk about my psychedelic work with well I talked with my friends at the University but I never brought them into my classes I never brought it to my students it's only after I've retired from the University and after I'm passed the statute of limitations for doing this work because I stopped this work in 1999 that I'm able to really bring forward the philosophical work the philosophical significance of these experiences and this is what I'd like to share with you tonight I am just finishing a book that I'm calling diamonds from heaven I don't know whether this is what it will look like because it's still being considered by a publisher but in my mind this is how I've imagined it Ervin Laszlo has contributed the forward to the book and what I would like to do is just basically take you through some of the highlights of this journey just little touches little scenarios here and there along the way and I'd like to emphasize that I did this work as a philosopher not as a therapist I wasn't primarily seeking healing I was seeking knowledge of how the universe works I saw myself as pursuing a new philosophical method a method that was pioneered by William James in the varieties of religious experience and this method consists of basically three steps three stages first to enter to structurally push the boundaries of your experience in carefully structured psychedelic sessions second to come back and make a phenomenologically complete and accurate record of your experiences within 24 hours after every session and third to critically analyze your experience to bring it into dialogue with other fields of knowledge and to compare it with the experiences of other psychedelic explorers so this is what happened now this is only the third time that I've tried to speak about these things in public so you'll have to forgive me if I follow my notes maybe a little more closely than I might otherwise do a few comments about method and then we'll go to the content Oh interesting the spacing is different than on my computer most of you are aware of the difference between low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy when I was doing this work I saw myself doing basically an extended series of high-dose psychedelic therapy the original protocol in Spring Grove Hospital restricted psychedelic sessions to a maximum of three sessions what they were trying to do was to trigger a near-death type experience for people who are approaching their own physical death and so I saw I thought whatever could be done three times safely could be done more time safely what I learned however was that while I my work always stayed within the bounds of safety working with multiple sessions with high doses of LSD opened up challenges and opportunities that weren't really considered in the first early stages of psychedelic therapy and so looking back over the course of my work I figured it I had to have a different name I had to find a different name for it so I call it psychedelic exploration the method is the method of psychedelic therapy complete isolation working with eyeshades with a sitter always with the sitter carefully calibrated music to pace the stages of the opening and closing of a session the difference is the number of sessions involved for me seventy-three sessions over 20 years I kept detailed records of all of my sessions I even tracked the astrological variables of my sessions looking at the correlations between transits and my session experiences I kept meticulous notes over these years about 400 pages of raw experiential data and the story I'm telling in diamonds from heaven and I call it diamonds from heaven by the way because I wanted to start at the end of the story I thought put the title that indicates where it ends but it took a long time before the diamonds came in it isn't really a personal story I mean it is a personal story but it's not primarily a personal story this diagram represents kind of a series of sessions and they're drawn overlapping to emphasize that one session pretty much starts where the second session stopped and I found that my personal experiences the healing experiences and insights into my personal life tended to take place at the beginning and the end of these sessions when I was leaving and coming back into time and space but when I was in the peak of the experiences indicated by these large circles after about the first 12 or 15 sessions I was operating in a state of consciousness that was far beyond personal states of consciousness and that's the story that I'm trying to tell in diamonds from heaven that's the philosophically significant story because that's I think the story that in some way we all share it's all part of our collective inherence and inheritance it's the cosmological story which is the important story when one does this work one goes through many cycles many iterations of death and rebirth not just ego death the first circle the this drop everything below the cross line takes place below time and space reality that's that bottom line kind of represents ego and the first death rebirth cycle which I've marked with the astrological glyphs kind of in recognition of Rickard tarnis and Stan gross insights into the correlation between astrological transits and one's experiences a non-ordinary states which I only partly affirm my experience as a firm and then don't confirm but that first death rebirth takes place at what Stan calls the perinatal level of consciousness and one moves into deeper states of consciousness and then death and rebirth repeats itself in a deeper formulation taking you into a deeper level of reality and a deeper level of reality Stan Grof follows Ken Wilber in describing these levels in terms of psychic subtle causal level reality I don't have any vested interest in what scale you use and certainly to differentiate only three dimensions of consciousness transpersonal consciousness is elementary because there are thousands and thousands dimensions of consciousness that one moves into but basically just to give a suggestion that there are many levels of consciousness and transpersonal consciousness and one enters these levels of consciousness in stages and at every stage there is a cost which is exacted there is a depth of surrender that takes place in the beginning what's asked is for you to surrender your ego but there are other types of surrender that take place at deeper levels of the journey to draw only one circle is to oversimplify sometimes these indicate numbers of sessions entering deeper and deeper into causal reality there are cycles within cycles within cycles so you can marker these all as one cycle but in fact there were cycles within cycles within cycles as a journey continues so the easiest way now is is just to give you the chapters to show you the chapters in the book and maybe share a few comments on each of the chapters so here are the chapters of diamonds from heaven crossing the perinatal plane the ocean of suffering deep time in the soul initiation into the universe the greater real of archetypal reality benediction of blessings the birth of the future human and diamond luminosity now there are some missing chapters as a methodology chapter and there's a chapter where I give a typical introduce to a typical session day but these are the chapters that carry the content of the sessions the content of the experiences the first crossing the perinatal planed is the easiest to summarize because it's the one most people are most familiar with from reading Stan Grof work one goes through many fetal experiences when relives ones experienced in the womb ones relives ones on birth when go through many variations of a death and rebirth process my going through this level took about two years and ten sessions and in the end in the ninth and tenth session the universe in my version of ego death it just snapped me like a twig the ego is on the end not very difficult to take apart it snapped me like a twig because by turning me into the exact opposite of everything I had known myself to be I entered the day as a white middle-class highly educated philosopher concerned with the meaning of existence and it just took all of those variables and reversed them I went in for hours and hours experiencing the lives of women and women's of color from multiple cultures around the world women who were poor women who had no interest in philosophy whatsoever and yet I was all of these things I was all of these beings lives it was terribly frightening for it was just scared me to death it was the perfect hell for a male philosopher there's nothing wrong with being a woman of course and there's nothing wrong with being poor and there's nothing being wrong with being not interested in philosophy the issue is it was my identification with my maleness my identification with my middle class whatever whatever which was the problem is what the universe had to break in me and the message was not simply recover your lives as women because I know I've had former lives as women this was different this was where you're going gender does not exist let go so as part of my entry into deeper states of consciousness my identity as a male was taken from me and when I was surrendered and when it was taken from me I entered into the most glorious experience of womanhood I experienced hundreds and hundreds of women I experienced all the aspects of female experiences that I could imagine I conceived I gave birth I laughed at my husband's I wish every man could have the experience of having such a deep experience of women's lies when I went into the next phase the next two years of work I entered a domain of extraordinary collective suffering I entered systematically deeper and deeper and deeper I was taken into just an orgy of pain and suffering it seemed to comprise all the wars of history all the droughts all the famines it was just it was a true ordeal in the beginning I thought that this represented a deepening of ego death I thought that somehow pieces of my ego had slipped through the first death and this was somehow a collective this collective suffering represented a deepening of ego death but eventually this went on for so long and it involves so many thousands and hundreds of thousands of beings that I came to a different conclusion the conclusion I came to was that somehow these sessions were using something was using my sessions not to heal my private person it wasn't about healing my private life it was about trying to heal the collective psyche of the human race that somehow all the trauma of all those wars and all that violence through history has launched itself into the collective psyche at least in this particular context one of the ways that the universe was trying to heal the human species was in these expanded states of consciousness beginning to siphon and draw out of it through this awareness the pain of the human species and transform that pain and bring it into the light now psychedelic sessions have two halves there is the first half which is the cleansing half where I was experiencing this ocean of suffering and then there's the second half you go through a certain amount of work and you the suffering comes to a culmination and after that the rest of the session you're spun into positive ecstatic trance personal spaces the ocean of suffering lasted two years but actually there was one year of work then I took a six-year break and then I started another ten years of work and the ocean of suffering when I resumed my work six years later started exactly where it had stopped six years before which I think is an indication of the precision and the intentionality of the intelligence that we are engaging in these deep states of consciousness when I came through the ocean of suffering in the first half the first year I entered into what I call deep time in the soul I had a series of experiences in which I experienced my entire life from beginning to end complete I experienced the distilled essence of everything that I was in the process of becoming and everything that I had become it was my entire life complete start to finish and it I kept coming back to it again and again and again the same system filled opening up layers more and more layers I began to have insights into the people I was related to to my wife to the family members the first time I entered this state when I came out of it I couldn't remember any of it I it was the most meaningful experience of my life but I couldn't remember it when I went back into it a second and a third and a fourth time however I began to remember more and more I could hold on to more and more of the experiences and this is an important histological point when you enter these states of consciousness you in the beginning will enter into new states of consciousness which are so cognitively original you can't hold on to it and this is where I think people talk about ineffability but if you keep going back to the same state of consciousness again and again and again you will remember more and more you literally have to teach yourself how to stay conscious in these deep states of consciousness and you can teach yourself to stay conscious in these deep states of consciousness it involves tremendous purification you you go through one level of purification after another but you can go through and remain conscious six years later when the ocean when I entered my work again and the ocean of suffering resumed that time when I went into the ecstatic portion of the experience as ice it started in a completely different space with no explanation I entered into what I call the initiation into the universe a series of sessions that took me deeper and deeper into the universe and gave me a carefully calibrated series of instructions it was like going to course except in this case the professor was the universe itself now I give my sessions names to help me remember them when I try to give them a name that represents the pith of each session and I break my sessions down into bullet points I'm trying to remember the entire session in the entire journey and so these are the names of the sessions that I'm addressing in initiation into the universe well sorry find relations forgot that one okay all right initiation into the universe you and I creating so it's taken back into the original point point of creation the cosmic tour some of these are represented you if you heard these names before they're in dark night early dawn the Council of Elders dying into oneness was a session of repeatedly dying a deeper and deeper and deeper into oneness the master plan was a the first of a series of visions that took place over many years in which I was being shown what the universe's agenda was for the human race I know it sounds arrogant it sounds like ego run amok to say that but in my experience what I was being shown was what the evolutionary trajectory was of humanity and what the evolutionary agenda was for Humanity eventually the ocean of suffering reached a level of intensity it's hard to describe it culminated in what I call healing the collective wound just a massive huge purification process of collective healing and when that finish it spun me into an unprecedented a new level of reality a level of reality that I call archetypal reality the greater real of archetype of reality when I first entered archetypal reality my identity as a human being began to fall away from me I found that there is a an identity that we have as a human being that is deeper than the identity we have as a specific human being and to enter into archetypal reality I literally had to leave behind the entire history of human race and the not just my personal history but I had to leave behind the conditions of human consciousness images an image like being in the space station orbiting above the earth I entered a state of consciousness that was beyond the collective psyche I was being worked with for months being taught how to experience how reality works at that level beyond our katha beyond the collective psyche in my experience there were two levels of reality that I experienced at that archetypal level one of them at the high subtle level one of it the low subtle level at the high syllable which i think of as kind of the platonic level I encountered living forms that were responsible for creating space-time and the core structures of space-time they were vast they were huge my mind imaged them like galaxies billions of light-years across they were just enormous I could not wrap my mind around them they were like there were archetypes but they were not like Plato's archetypes there were not eternal ideas in on mind of an unchanging God they were living forms that were changing but over vast tracts of time subsequently I went into lower subtle liberal reality which is more of a Jungian kind of level I entered into the living tissue of the collective psyche I had many experiences over and over again of the wholeness that the human psyche represents that it is even the human body I had experiences of the archetype of the body that all of us are fractal manifestations of aspects of and I experienced how each of us in healing our individual diseases is contributing to the archetypal structure of our human body as it becomes stronger and stronger through history I began to have experiences of reincarnation but as a collective process I had always imaged reincarnation as an individual process where we individually are developing our souls journey but I began to have experiences of vast of the human race as a single organism incarnated intelligently creatively in ten ashlee generation by generation I was in working in deep time experiencing the pulse of humanity self evolution through incarnation of billions and billions of beings every century just moving it was both simultaneously a numinous experience and an absolutely devastating experience at the same time to experience all of humanity with all the experiences that all of us are going through in every generation to experience that from the perspective of the unified intelligence that was manifesting as the species and evolving the species farther and farther through time it was one of it gave me a completely expanded horizon of the intelligence of the universe after spending 18 months exploring archetypal reality which is not long and I went through it with very big steps so what my description is very incomplete of the totality of that reality I entered a year of extraordinary blessings it was a I called it the benediction of blessings it was one blessing after another for an entire year these are the names of the sessions oh I've got to keep up with my notes a little bit more these are the sessions I dealt with an archetype of reality let me jump back there for just a second notice how much cleansing is involved even when you're working at such a deep level of consciousness session 28 was an extraordinarily positive blessing it was my first contact with causal reality I touched this extraordinarily beautiful ecstatic state of consciousness I was only there for 30 minutes but the next three sessions over six months were just grueling ordeals of detoxification and purification what I came to understand is each deeper state of consciousness is a higher level of energy and when you enter a deeper state of consciousness you you have to acclimate to that higher level of energy otherwise your your experiences there will be fragmented you'll be chaotically confused and so just that one touch of causal reality it took three sessions hours and hours of physical psychological detoxification in order for me to be able to return to that state of consciousness so I could return to it more clearly so I could stay more cognitively coherent in that state this is a pattern that repeats itself over and over and over again as you go deeper and deeper into the universe so much so that I began to dread the session after every major breakthrough there was a carrying out the garbage quality every time I broke through into a new luminous state of consciousness the next sessions were chest oh just terribly difficult now now I can go into the benediction of blessings I present four sessions in the book each of these was different the forest was an experience of oneness Shunyata emptiness it was like no present no self present in me no self present any in the world it's an absolute transparency to the totality of life as a living singularity it was a deep entry into causal reality singing the universe away jumping over singing the universe way was an entering into the primal void it was an entering into the the Buddha Wolman satchitananda it was the the primal fertile void that underlies all manifest existence Jesus's blood was an experience of overwhelming experience of cosmic love it's just being drenched in you've never been loved until you've been loved like God you know it's just just overwhelming experience of love deeper than anything I'd ever experienced before let me mention the birth of the diamond soul just a little bit longer because it'll come up again later in the sessions eleven years previous I had had the experience of my life as a completed whole start to finish but in the fortieth session I began to experience the integration of all my former lives they were coming in it was like winding a string and around a kite spool all my former lives are coming in fast and furious and it was like winding a string of white light on the kite spool and when it hit a certain critical mass it exploded all those individual lives fused into one life and they exploded it was my first contact with what I would call diamond luminosity my heart just ruptured and exploded my consciousness jumped far beyond any consciousness of any individual life and I think what I experienced at that day was where reincarnation is taking humanity reincarnation is not adding a little bit lifetime by lifetime adding a few more qualities a few more capacities lifetime by lifetime reincarnation is taking us into I think eventually taking us into a point where all of our former lives all of our history all of our learning will fuse and when it fuses it lifts us into the next step in human evolution the soul literally will wake up on earth because I think reincarnation we die our mind gets large we are born we contract to a small consciousness we go from the soul to the ego the soul to the ego but if we keep this up for thousands of years sooner or later sooner or later the soul is going to wake up on earth and when that happens everything changes because the soul experiences life differently than the ego does the soul experiences a depth of connection with other beings because we've all we've we've been in each other's lives for centuries and centuries the soul has a different relationship to the earth because the soul knows that the earth that it leaves will be the earth it's going to inherit in its next incarnation so it has a whole different relationship to the issues of ecology and caretaking of the earth where the sessions went next chronologically was into the diamond luminosity work but before I go into that I need to backtrack a little bit and talk about the birth of the few future human when I started this work I never imagined that what I'm about to describe to you would become part of it I was thinking that this I was doing this work from my personal healing for my personal transformation but my personal enlightenment whatever but what happened was I started in the twenty third session and in multiple sessions over the course of the years I started to have repeated visions of the human race the the what was happening to the human race and I think this is a natural progression because when you die as an individual when you die as an ego and your consciousness opens it doesn't just open into the oneness of God it opens up into the species that you are into the life of the species and just like we have a feeling of our individual age you enter into the age of your species and I was repeatedly shown that the human species is coming into a time of a tremendous exponential explosion in its capacity we were coming into a time of great awakening so in this chapter I present what are six visions that I call the visions of awakening visions that I pull out of all these other sessions that I've already presented and I just kind of weave them together to tell to show the coherent story the story of this Great Awakening the story of this birth that we are coming into and I had seen over for years this story but it never showed me how it was going to pull it off I never saw how we were going to make this jump in consciousness and then in 1995 a week before Christmas I went into I was expecting to go I was in the diamond luminosity work I was expecting to go one more time into the diamond luminosity state but instead the universe threw me far into deep time far into humanity's future and it gave me the experience of the death and rebirth of our species at a collective level there was nothing personal about my experience i-i-i was the human species i was the psyche of the planet as a whole i had dissolved into the collective psyche and i experienced a death that took place at that level it was a near-death experience but for the species there was a time we were overtaken by conditions it was a loss of control it was a loss of a deconstruction it was a time of great suffering i think the 21st century is going to be the beginning of the dark night of our collective soul it is going to be the time of the great undoing we're going to lose control we've postponed making the important in environmental ecological cultural decisions so many times that i think there's no avoiding the fact that we are coming to a time of a great mobile systems crisis and just when it had reached it's worse just when it was at its worse it passed the storm passed like a hurricane going over an island and when we began to collect ourselves to pick ourselves off of the ground there was an exponential growth of light within the human species an exponential growth in intelligence in ideas in creativity in social formulations in social formats new families were springing up I think that this process that we are going through is leading us not simply to recreate our culture and recreate society and decreed a new technology and a new economy it's literally a transformation that is taking place at the core of the collective psyche our collective psyche is going to make a shift into a new foundation and after that point everyone born a human being is going to be operating out of a new foundation I think we truly are becoming a species of Buddhas a species of Christ and prophets after the benediction of blessings I was completely content I mean I the universe had asked me to give something in the ocean of suffering and I gave it and it rewarded me with more joy than I could ever imagine it was just an overwhelming joy I had known God I I had known the fertile void it was it was a philosopher's dream come true I had no idea where things would go but there were still five years ahead on the journey and where it went it took me into after one more death and rebirth cycle it took me into an extraordinarily hyper clear state of consciousness it took me into the light that I came to call diamond luminosity it's what the Buddhists call dharmakaya the absolute clear light of being now I had known light many times before light comes in light had come in at the subtle level of consciousness light had come in and many different dimensions but this is a different order of light when I call it the diamond light I'm not simply using a metaphor to describe the light I'm trying to describe a particular quality of light an ultra clear super luminescent just clear beyond imagination I entered the diamond luminosity four times in the next four years out of twenty five sessions only four times did I enter the diamond luminosity these are the names that I gave these sessions in between each entry into the diamond luminosity as you can imagine tremendous purification tremendous detoxification healing the system just but then I would get spun into another experience of this diamond light there were two movements in this process there was a progressive entering deeper and deeper into the diamond luminosity into the 50th session was the deepest I ever went into the diamond luminosity I was in I was in a state of deep absorption into pure light I was light my boundaries are lost entirely I was as I was as happiest you can imagine a person being and just at that moment something happened that changed my entire understanding of life the my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and in the far distance I saw a reality that was as far beyond where I was as where I was in the diamond light was beyond earth time-space and in that reality I saw light and I was hit by a ray of light from that reality it hit me and it just shattered me I call it the absolute light just to give it a name and that's when I understood that it's an infinite progression there is no end to the journey there is no reaching the end of God the end of the divine like many of us I had adopted the belief that there was an end to this journey it had been described differently by different people oneness with God or the super cosmic void entering the super cosmic void but I had entered the divine oneness many times and I had learned that there were dimensions of oneness there are different variations within there are depths of one to oneness and I had entered the primal void but I learned that there are even depths of void within void but I had always assumed that there was still an end I could get to an end that would be the destiny the the final or stopping point and this taught me it's an infinite progression it there there is no stopping point the divine is infinitely large and that's why if I were doing it over again I wouldn't use the same method that I'd used before I would be gentler with myself I would not push myself so hard to enter so deep so fast even though 20 years may not be very fast I would be gentler with myself because now I know that the goal of this work is not to try to reach some state some condition the goal of this work is to open up and to let in as much of the divine into you as you possibly can and to allow it to transform your life and to transform your existence and everything that you can do with that awareness in life the last years works final visions these are the sessions that I address in the book the last two visions the last two sessions were what I call the goodbye sessions I didn't know I was stopping this work I was thought I was going to continue to do it but the consciousness that had always guided my sessions it choreographed the ending of our work time together before I knew what was happening it gave me an overview of my entire life's work it showed me in the end and this fruits of my labor how all of my work fit together what the correlations were and I used the experiences in that session to actually organize the telling of the story in diamonds from heaven and then he gave me a series of last instructions before we parted but before that happened there was one serious piece of work to do chapter 7 seventh session seventy on that session the universe put me through a strip down which was one of the hardest most deepest one of the deepest most demanding strip downs that I've ever been anywhere on the journey I would not have believed it would have been possible to go through so many layers of dying in death and just complete loose loss of all reality as I went through in this session and after going through this for an hour and a half or two hours that spun me out into a condition as very clear state of consciousness and it to make a long story short since I'm already at the end of my time I'm past time I'm sorry it took me deeper into deep time than it had ever taken me before it took me deep deep into a time frame somewhere on the order of a hundred two hundred thousand years and it gave me a series of experiences that were the culmination of the birth of the future human it gave me the capstone of the story of the the master story of where we're going it gave me the deepest experience that I had of the being that we are becoming it was as if I was taken into the future and allowed to try on for size the being that the creative intelligence of the universe is bringing forward on our planet such a magnificent being just an extraordinary being it's so important that we hold a vision of where we're going of what is actually happening because as the dark shadows gather in this century in the century ahead we could lose ourselves in despair we could lose ourselves in hopelessness if we don't understand that we are in labor we are in labor and we are giving birth and we're not simply giving birth to a slightly improved version of ourselves we are giving birth to an extraordinary child a child that has never existed as a species on this planet before one of the other things this experience it taught me was they gave me a series of lessons and it taught me something that was a missing piece to everything that I had been given before about the birth of the future human it told me that it showed me that we are built for speed our species is built for speed we have a tendency to think of human nature you know kind of as a staffing human nature this human nature that but really if you step back into an expanded time frame and if you think in terms of reincarnation you think in terms of all the lives that we are winding around and then this gathering of knowledge which is taking place in the center in the archetypal center when this center shifts there is an exponential jump and when you look at the whole evolutionary dynamic that evolution that reincarnation makes possible it becomes clear that we are carrying our history on our backs in much smaller packs than we had then we might think if we didn't take this large perspective we are built for speed the human species is built for speed we are built for evolutionary acceleration and we are in a tremendously accelerated spit time of history right now and before any of us were born before we were born we knew what we were getting into we knew we chose we knew what was happening to the human race we knew what a hard time this century was going to be and we made a choice to participate in this time in history to be part of this exciting and dynamic if difficult but this important progression now I'm done my time is done I can't go on further I will just very quickly say when I stopped I stopped my sessions for two reasons for pain because my subtle energy system was overexcited was kind of I was running too much energy even though I had done I took a lot of yoga didn't meditation did all the things you try to do to take care of yourself but the main reason I stopped was heartache I literally reached a point where I could not take coming back I could not take coming back out of the divine once you have dissolved completely into light once you have known the joy of being light of experiencing reality a slight time-space reality can begin to feel kind of dried up and in fact when I stopped my sessions I entered a period of deep deep sadness I did a good job integrating my sessions as I went I really worked hard on integral my sessions but when I stopped my sessions I entered a deep deep existential sadness and I know that near-death episode people have this experience I knew that Carl Jung had this experience in the hospital I knew it was not alone in this but I had entered so deeply into the divine expanse that my wound was particularly deep eventually I reached a point where I knew I was just waiting to die I was just waiting I was taking care of my family I was doing my lectures I was you know I was doing my taking care of my responsibilities but in my heart of hearts I was just waiting to die so that I could return to my beloved eventually I began to realize that's that's not right this is not a good way to live it's not not the way this work is supposed to go it's not good to be living your life waiting to die so I made a determined effort to bring myself into my historical existence again to ground myself into time and space I learned that somewhere along the way I made a mistake the mistake I made was that I had lost the balance between transcendence and imminence I had thrown myself so deeply into divine transcendence that I lost my footing inside the imminent divine inside the body of God inside the physical presence of God that we all are it took me about 10 years to get myself fully grounded back in time and space and fully kind of comfortable back in time-space again and in this respect my experience on this journey is a cautionary tale it's not simply like you know the hero's journey where you go when you have an adventure and you bring back with good news it's a cautionary tale it's transcendence is a it's a complicated paradoxical thing a little bit of transcendence is good it's healing it can it can help us understand who we are and what we and where we are and what here is but too much transcendence can cause you to lose sight of an equally important fact the fact that the physical world is the manifest body of the divine so thank you very much for letting me tell my story to you [Applause] you</p>

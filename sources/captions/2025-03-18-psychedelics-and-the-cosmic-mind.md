Now I'll switch over to the internet video. Welcome, Chris. It's a great joy to have

you with me on New Thinking Allowed today. Thank you, Amy. It's a pleasure to be here. Today,

we're going to discuss your deep exploration of yourself, your own spiritual journey and into

the cosmic mind. When you had 73 LSD sessions between the years of 1979 to 1999, and you

outlined that in your book, LSD in the Mind of the Universe. Before we get into all that you

experienced and what you gleaned and learned from those sessions, can we just begin with

talking a little bit about what you've noticed in the last, oh, I don't know, 10 plus years

or more where it seems that the taboo related to psychedelics seems to be shifting. The

types of psychedelics there are out there and what their uses are for, not each one,

but sort of overall why people do this. And today we're going to focus on

specifically the cosmic exploration of them. Well, as you know, there

is a worldwide renaissance of research taking place in psychedelics.

At the forefront of that research is the focus on therapeutic healing. That's what's bringing

psychedelics back into the intellectual and clinical community. The capacity of these

amplifying substances to bring forward the personal unconscious and to unearth the wounds

of the personal unconscious and to assist and deepen and accelerate people's healings of trauma

and various issues, post-traumatic stress, depression, things like this.

A second use of psychedelics, overlapping but different from therapeutic healing,

is using psychedelics to promote spiritual awakening, an awakening to the true nature,

our deeper nature underneath our personality nature, to deepen our

understanding, our experience of the wisdom of the universe, the intelligence of

the universe, the consciousness of the universe, classic kind of spiritual awakening

to the nature of spiritual reality. And that's why I got started in this work,

really, was to deepen my spiritual awakening. But the protocol that I ended up using was so

strong and so evocative. Within a few years, I was having experiences that went far beyond

anything that could be understood in terms of either therapeutic healing or spiritual

awakening. And I came to understand over time that the project

that I was involved in was cosmological exploration. That

is, a systematic attempt to explore the deep structure of spiritual

reality or the deep structure of the consciousness of the universe

itself. So that's really what my work is about. I'm not a clinician. I am trained as a philosopher

of religion. What interested me from Stan Grof's early work was the capacity of these substances

to lay bare not only the personal issues, but to enter into deep communion with the consciousness

that lies behind existence. Can you share, give us an overview of the

different types of psychedelics? Just to kind of list them off, of course, because

there are many, but we're going to primarily talk about your experience with LSD today. Many

psychedelics. I mean, I guess the primary ones that come to mind are LSD, psilocybin, MDMA,

though that's probably an empathogen more than psychedelic, 5-MeO-DMT, salvia divinorum, San

Pedro. I mean, I think these are the types of psychedelics that most people are familiar

with. There are all sorts of derivatives. MDMA, they're derivatives off of each of

these little tweaks along the way. And we also want to say upfront that you're

not recommending necessarily that people engage in the same process you engaged in

or advocating necessarily for the use of these per se. Is that right? Absolutely.

There are a large percentage of the population who shouldn't be doing psychedelics at all. These

are very powerful amplifiers of consciousness. They have tremendous evocative potential. And

there are persons who should not be venturing into these waters. And no one should be

venturing into these waters without really good, high quality, professional guides accompanying

you to keep you safe as you enter into this territory. Now, the protocol that I chose to work

with was high doses of LSD. I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms. And looking back at it, at

the end of it, I think, what was I thinking? That was ridiculous. But I had a deep hunger to

explore the nature of existence. And working at these high doses took me on an adventure of

a lifetime. But this is very demanding work, which requires a lot of

concentration, a lot of safeguards, and a lot of time to assimilate the experiences

And I really, knowing what I know now, at the end of this journey, I strongly recommend against

using the protocol that I used. If I were doing it over again, I would work with lower doses of

psychedelics. I'd be much gentler on myself. I'd be willing to sort of peel

back the layers of the psyche much more gradually than I did in this work. So

to begin into your journey, what was the impetus for you to embark on this deep exploration with

high doses of LSD? Well, I had just finished my graduate work. I had just started my academic

career. At the time, I was a pretty convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. And then I

met the work of two people. Ian Stevenson, whose work on reincarnation convinced me

that reincarnation was a simple fact of life. And the other one was Stanislav Grof. And I read

his book Realms of the Human Unconscious. I read it in 1978, two years after it had just come out.

And as soon as I read that book, I recognized that Stan's work had tremendous significance, not

only for psychotherapy, but it had tremendous significance for philosophy

of religion, philosophy of consciousness. And I knew that if I was ever

going to make a contribution in this field, I had to undergo my own therapeutic exploration,

my own regimen. So very uncomfortably, I made a decision to break the law in a very, I hope,

disciplined and restrained way. And I began a series of psychedelic sessions, which ended up,

much to my surprise, ended up lasting 20 years. I worked for four years, I stopped for six years,

and then I worked for another 10 years, finishing in 1999. And then I spent 20 years after that,

digesting these experiences, analyzing them, sifting them, sorting them, and then wrote

LSD in the Mind of the Universe in 2019, 20 years after I had stopped my sessions.

Can you give us a sense of what your sessions were like? How you began?

You mentioned that you had a sitter, somebody with you in that process. How did

you choose to set up your set and setting? Well, basically, I followed the protocol

established by Stan, reflected in his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and then

clarified further in his book LSD Psychotherapy, where he lays out all the nuts and bolts of

working in this modality. I was always in a room separated from the world, protected from the

world, no interruptions, by myself with my sitter, who was my wife at the time, who's a clinical

psychologist who studied the psychedelic literature with me. I'm lying down, I'm using

eye shades and headphones, conventional kind of classic psychedelic deep introspection, deep

meditative orientation, very carefully curated music to support the opening and the peaking and

the closing of a session. So the basic idea is to profoundly energize the unconscious and then

to create an environment where the energies rising through your unconscious can be engaged cleanly

and clearly. If you stay in contact with the physical world, if you're in dialogue with friends

or if you're going to a concert, that's all fine and good, but that's just not what this work

is about. It requires a powerful amplification of the unconscious, but then creating a very

carefully controlled environment that allows you to engage what rises conscientiously and most

importantly to follow whatever arises to its very bottom level, to the bottom line, to let it take

you wherever it wants to take you. If I recall correctly, it was typically on Saturdays because

you had a very important day job teaching at a university and I think your sessions lasted about, was it eight hours each

roughly? Yeah, pretty much. I would start in the early morning and I would

finish by nighttime that night, a late afternoon nighttime, so a session would last eight, ten

hours or so of the carryover tail, but basically a good hard eight hours each session. So it's a

major commitment. Eventually I developed spiritual protocols that I would adopt in the weeks leading

up to a session and in the weeks after a session and particularly the day or two before a

session and the day or two after the session. You really have to work with that time and

with the energy that is stirred in you because if you're working with very high doses of a

powerful psychedelic like LSD, it taps into very deep levels of the universe and it takes

your body and mind and subtle energy system a time to process that material and so it's a

major time commitment. It's just not the day of. It's several days before and several days after.

You also took meticulous notes from your sessions as well, which is a lot of what's in your book.

Yeah, that's the first step of integration is to create an accurate phenomenological description

of exactly what happens in your sessions because integration is the foundation of your future

sessions. If you don't integrate your sessions thoroughly and conscientiously, then you're

not going to have as likely to have as deep an experience the next session out. So there's a

circle where you open, but then you integrate what you experience, which lays the foundation

for the deeper opening in your next session. Yeah, it seems like they built upon each other. In my experience, they did. Again, I kind of

standardized my sessions as much as possible, eliminating as many variables. I always was

using the same substance, the same dose, the same set and setting, the same sitter,

even in the same part of the country. If you change those variables, it changes the

subtlety of the interface between your mind and the universe's mind that you're engaging.

So by trying to standardize those variables, you create an environment of sustained

communion or dialogue with this deeper consciousness. And by creating that sustained

clear contact point, my experience was that the universe or the consciousness, whatever

it was that I was engaging, that consciousness took me deeper and deeper in a systematic fashion.

It was like taking a series of graduate courses in consciousness. It was a tremendous, rigorous,

systematic expansion of my frame of reality. Why did you choose this path versus, for example,

sitting in meditation or some other spiritual path that can lead you deeper into these realms?

Well, I had been meditating since college. I was familiar with meditation. I'd meditated in a

couple of different traditions by that time. And I'm a professor of religious studies, so

I had a good solid grounding in the world's spiritual traditions. I taught courses in

psychology of religion and transpersonal studies and comparative mysticism. So I understood the

world of meditation and contemplative practice. I started by thinking that these sessions would

basically help me break through some of the obstacles that had risen in my contemplative

practice. What I found, however, was that this was a protocol of

spiritual exploration took me deeper than I had ever imagined

being possible when I began this work. And once I was into it a couple of years,

I had developed an aptitude for working in these states. And I never stopped meditating. I was

always meditating through this time. I was always doing yoga and various spiritual practices. In

fact, I think that the deeper you want to go in working with psychedelics, the more important

it is to have a daily spiritual practice that helps anchor you and helps you absorb the

experiences that you unleash with psychedelics. It was a different protocol. It gave me access

to states of consciousness that you can reach with meditation, but only with lifetimes,

not just one lifetime, but many lifetimes of meditation. So I differentiate between

what I call the path of temporary immersion, which is working with psychedelics, as you're

only immersed in these states for hours at a time, versus the path of presence, of contemplative

presence, where it's a slower path, but it tends to produce states of abiding

transparency, whereas the temporary path pushes you deep into these conscious domains,

and then it wears off and you come back. They're complementing approaches,

but they are different. Let's begin with your very first session. Just

to get us started, because I know you've done many of them, to give the listeners, the audience,

the viewers a taste of what your experience was like that led you to keep

wanting to come back for more. Probably the most significant thing

that happened in my first session was that I entered a phase of the work where I

could not remember who I was. I could not remember what I was, what I did for a living. I could

not remember whether I was a man or a woman, even. It was a complete interruption of my stream

of consciousness that was telling me who and what I was. This was a frightening experience, a

jarring experience, but in the end, I learned that it was a very helpful experience because it

showed me that it would be pointless for me to try to stay in control, because if you can't control

your self-knowledge, then that's about as basic as you can get. This session taught me that

in this work, you have to surrender radically to whatever arises. It saved me a lot of time

and energy later when more demanding experiences opened. There's a tendency to sort of want to

maintain control, to hold on to reality as you know it. In this type of work, you have to let go

of reality as you know it. You have to completely surrender and go where it wants to take you. That

was just the first lesson that basically said, don't waste time trying to maintain control.

Before we go further into some of your sessions and giving us a taste of your experiences and

what you learned, have you come to understand the physiology of what LSD is doing on the

human physiology, the nervous system? Of course, a lot of people think about connect consciousness

with the brain, which of course, it's more than that. However, I recently spoke with Jill Bolte

Taylor, who is a neuroanatomist from Harvard. She wrote a well-known book, Her Stroke of

Insight, where she had a stroke. She had an eight-year journey of recovery back, but she

described that our personal sense of identity is just the size of a peanut in our brains. I

follow the discussion of the scientists about what is biochemistry of LSD and how it affects

brain structure and default mode network interruption and those type of discussions,

but I'm not really drawn to that conversation. I'm not primarily a scientist in training. I

basically have taken more of a psychological approach to understanding that

these substances, whatever their mechanism, they amplify consciousness.

They hypersensitize consciousness and they allow you to experience dimensions of your mind and

of reality beyond your mind, which usually were kept in a space-time kind of focus

where we don't experience these subtler textures. Right. Where we can feel trapped inside our bodies

or in what most people consider is primarily the materialistic world, which we know is

there's much more than that, which is what we're talking about today.

Yeah. Yeah. That's the real draw to me. I basically work within the frame of reference

that I had acquired from Stan Grof and some of the other earlier researchers using a description

of the dynamic qualities of psychedelic consciousness or the consciousness that arises

with psychedelics. I'll let the science guys sort out the physiology of it.

I know that that's interesting and I find that often the physiological

discussion is carried out within reductive metaphysical assumptions, which really is

not helping our conversation right now. You mean the conversation in general.

We're having a good conversation, right? I mean, particularly the attempts to sort of

understand, to correlate what's happening in the brain physiologically with the states

of consciousness that one is experiencing, but often these discussions take place within

a certain set of metaphysical assumptions, and too often those metaphysical assumptions

tend to be reductive. They tend to sort of lean in the direction of thinking that physical

reality is the dominant and determining reality of one's experience. But when you actually look

at the experiences that emerge in psychedelics, that restrictive metaphysical

framework is shattered. Yeah. Well, I just want to touch

on it for now and primarily because there may be those listening thinking, well,

this is just your brain on drugs and it's causing the whole chemical reaction. That's been discussed

with near-death experiencers and so forth, but research has shown that there's more going

on with that. So I definitely understand what you're saying and we can get into the

veracity or the trusting of these experiences a little later in our conversation. Can you

take us more into some of your experiences with your sessions with LSD to give us

a taste of what that was like for you? That's a hard question. I mean, let's give a

context. Some very influential books were written based on a very limited number of psychedelic

experiences. So Aldous Huxley wrote his very important, beautiful book, The Doors of

Perception, after only one mescaline experience. Houston Smith wrote his book, his

Collected Reflections on Psychedelics, Cleansing the Doors of Perception, after only

taking LSD six times over the course of his lifetime. Michael Pollan wrote his book, which

is a very important, very helpful book, but after only a handful of psychedelic experiences. So the

challenge that anyone faces coming into my work are the challenges that I have conveying my

experiences is just how long the journey was, how many layers of consciousness opened in that

journey. It's not simply a matter of opening 73 times to the same interface, is that there is a

cycle of death and rebirth that reproduces itself so that death breaks you free of one level of

reality, physical reality, in the beginning. It enters, takes you into a non-physical,

spiritual reality, and you work there for a while, but if you work consistently, eventually

you'll go through another death and rebirth that will take you into another level of

reality where you have to learn the whole rules of that level of reality, which then

will be followed taking you into another level. So the problem I have with answering your

question is so many levels of reality. If I focused on any one, I'd be leaving out so many others. So

let me just say this in the beginning. When I was looking over the whole of my sessions

and putting them together in order to write this storyline of what happened on those sessions,

I eventually differentiated or distinguished five different broad categories that my sessions

fell into. First, having to do with personal mind, your personal unconscious, your personal story.

Second, collective mind, which has to do with the collective psyche, the psyche of humanity,

the species mind. The third, archetypal mind, which in my case, I'm primarily addressing

not archetypes in the Jungian sense, but archetypes more in the Platonic sense of the

levels, dimensions of reality, which lie outside time and space and outside the collective

psyche. Causal levels of reality are the level of oneness, the level where

oneness becomes the dominant reality. And then beyond that, diamond luminosity, a

particularly clear dimension of light that I encountered and worked with in the last five

years of my work. So all of my experiences, I can kind of lay them out as a sequential

journey, starting at the level of personal mind, moving into the level of collective mind,

archetypal mind, so on and so forth. Well, I would love to discuss each of those

levels you went into. What I recall reading in your book that seemed to be common themes of

your sessions were that it was, like you said earlier, a letting go and that there was, it

seemed a lot of pain and suffering to actually reach to these deeper levels of consciousness.

Can you share what that was like for you? In the early stage, and when I was working at

the level of personal mind, that the pain and suffering came in the form of what Stan Grof

has very well discussed and presented in his discussion of the perinatal level

of consciousness. Basically, sometimes reliving your birth,

but confronting the fundamental existential questions that dominate life and physical reality.

Is there any meaning in the universe? Is there any order, any design to it, any intelligence of it?

Because at just the physical level, everything we love, everything we know will be destroyed at

death. Is there any reality beyond death? I mean, that's, and therefore you, you have to face the

deepest levels of metaphysical angst in order to move through this until eventually your identity

is just crushed and shattered. That's easier for some people to undergo

than it is for other people, but you have to surrender your time-space identity

in order to gain access to the next level of reality. At that next level of reality, I

continue to have a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence. It

was so deep and it lasted so long and it seemed to encompass so many hundreds of thousands

of persons in so many thousands of years that I eventually came to the

decision that this was not some, didn't represent a deepening or

cleansing or healing of my personal psyche. That what was being healed

here was some aspect of the collective psyche of humanity itself, that something was

using my sessions in order to set in motion a reconciliation and a healing of levels of pain

that were fundamentally collective, not personal. And then more levels of death and rebirth

where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. But the

basic principle is pretty simple. If you want to experience oneness with God or if

you want to experience a deep experience of the nature of the mind of the universe, the problem

is our historical consciousness is just too small. If you want to literally experience it, I mean

it's one thing to think about it, but to actually immerse yourself in the communion with these

levels of reality, your small identity has to be surrendered and you have to flow, be willing

to flow into a larger level of identity. So eventually you're going into levels of reality

where it would be a misrepresentation to think that Chris Bache went and had those experiences.

Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved in order for these levels of

consciousness to manifest inside Chris Bache's awareness. But the fact that I remember those

experiences doesn't mean that my personality identity was present when those experiences were

being had. It's kind of like you have to lose yourself, enter into communion with the universe,

and then when you come back you gather your and then my personality synthesizes them,

digests them, trying to integrate them. But it's a pulsing. You learn to sort of

surrender completely, open, breathe deeply, you receive teachings, then

you bring it all back in, and then you try to integrate it and consolidate

it. What are some of the teachings you received? That the universe is a manifestation of a single

consciousness, a massive consciousness, beyond anything that we've ever begun to grasp

in our Western religious and philosophical traditions, that creation is an

intentional act. It is an act … I hate to use the word design because those

theories are problematic, but there is an intelligence manifesting itself in time and

space that we are part of this intelligence, that our nature is of the same nature as its

nature. So this is an ancient idea. Atman is Brahman. The essence of the individual is the

essence of the totality. That reincarnation is simply a fact of life. I don't think we get

anywhere in trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life, unless we

understand that our current life is just the most recent in many, many repeating cycles of

life and death. That there is an underlying logic to the circumstances within which we find

ourselves. The Buddhists and the Hindus talk about karma, that there is a deeper

intentionality working itself out in the circumstances of

our existence, and that… our evolutionary existence, is not simply driven

by blind chance and mechanical processes, which are purely mechanical, but that there

is a deeper intelligence manifesting itself in the circumstances of our life, in

the challenges that we are facing, and inviting us to become more by the end

of our life than we were in the beginning. So just a few touch points. Yeah, yeah. Going

back to your experiences in these sessions, it seems that death and rebirth and a

purification process happened in many, if not all, of your sessions. Yeah. What did

you come to understand was the reason for that? First, the general structure of the

sessions as I experienced them is that every session, there's a sort of a rhythm

of a cycle with variations, but basically, the first early hours of a session are spent

in some type of deep purification process, deep confrontation. And then if you surrender to

that process and let it take you, it reaches a culmination point. There is a surrender, a death

rebirth process in which you are then spun into transpersonal ecstatic places for the remainder

of the session. And then that runs its course. And then the next session, however many months

between, and I was doing about five sessions a year on average, starts you right back into

the purification part and carrying you then forward into the ecstatic portion. So the purpose

of the purification and the purpose of the death is simply cleaning, just cleaning,

cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. When you eventually come to have deep experience

of the fundamental identity of your nature and the divine nature, or the infinite nature,

that you are the infinite, then it gives you a different perspective on what it is that was

present preventing you all those years from realizing that. what was keeping you from it. And

it's this tight conditioning of the psyche. It's the type conditioning which is associated with

your time-space consciousness. And that has to be softened, it has to be released, it has to be let go in order to

move into these expansive places. So the death rebirth cycle is actually a

purification cycle. In fact, I learned that death is actually an intense stage of

purification. Once you've died many times, you learn that truly it's impossible to die. What

you are can die. The structure of your life can die. Reality as you have known it can die. But the

phoenix always rises. The essence of the person always emerges in a different reality

with new potentials, with new capacities, but it's impossible to die. And the reason

we can't die is, I think, because our nature is the nature of the divine. So the form can die,

but the essence cannot die. Once you know that, then I began to understand that the experience

of death, which kept coming up in my sessions, was actually an experience, an

advanced experience of purification. When purification reaches a critical portion,

position, so that it begins to dissolve the fundamental structures of what you had known

as real, then you have reached the death point, the death and rebirth point. And death has come

back to grace you again. So from my perspective, experiencing death in a psychedelic session

or to experience horrendous suffering or pain is actually an exciting stage in the work. It's

not something to be avoided. A lot of people worry about, oh, I don't want to have a bad session. We

got to do everything we can to avoid having a bad session. But I think that's a

radical misunderstanding of the depth of consciousness and the power that

technique gives you. In my experience, you begin to understand that

the deeper the purification, the deeper the ecstatic immersion, so that you

begin to welcome the purification. You begin to welcome the challenges that you face. You begin

to welcome the bad sessions in order to actualize a higher, more intimate experience with the

divine consciousness. Now, that's assuming that you're working in a completely controlled

environment. You have done all the homework. You've done your preparation. You can have a bad

session for a lot of bad reasons. You can be in the wrong place, the wrong time, not preparing

yourself, wrong set and setting. Those can give you bad sessions, which are not of the quality

that I'm talking about. Yeah, I will share that when I was in high school, a group of friends

wanted to do LSD or acid as it was called as well. And I did not partake. However, I was the sitter

and my role was to make sure that everybody did have a good experience, which actually

the few times that that happened was always the case. But, I know you mentioned that a bad trip is not necessarily a bad trip. Yeah.

So you suggest that that's part of the process, but one needs to be… have done the preparation

ahead of time to know what they're getting into. Yeah, I mean, psychedelics amplify consciousness

and most people will take us like… I don't want to overgeneralize… Some people take a psychedelic

and what they're looking for is a good afternoon, a little more openness to the life of the

universe, a little more openness to the love that's in the universe. And they maintain the

fundamental parameters of their personality, get softer and expansive and let some of

these experiences in, which is perfectly fine. But if you want to go into a deep dive, if you

want to explore the deep structure of existence, if you want to transcend space, transcend

time, move into the deep future, that requires a more carefully

laid out strategy in working with these states. So I'm not suggesting

that the way I work with these states is the only way, beneficial way to work with these states is

simply for me as a philosopher, I was looking for depth of immersion, depth of understanding

that takes some serious work. So while we're on the topic of this death and rebirth,

surrendering, purification, can you share with us what is it that dies and reborn? I know you

outline in your book a few different areas that you've come to understand. Yeah, well basically

this became a real intellectual issue for me. I mean, when you experience dying and being reborn

through multiple levels of reality, it then becomes a question, what

is it that's actually dying? You may have deep and profound experiences of

dying years after you've gone through ego death, and it's not simply the ego dying over and over

and over again. It's a different kind of death. So at the appendix in LSD and the Mind of the

Universe, I have an appendix on what dies and is reborn, and I suggest four levels of maybe

beginning to address that question. One of them is what dies is our personal ego. Second is

what dies is some aspect of the collective ego, of the collective psyche. Third, what dies is what

I call the shamanic persona, complicated concept, but when you've been on the journey for a long

time, when you move into psychedelic space, you resume your psychedelic persona, you

resume your shamanic persona. It's like, as a friend of mine said, you

walk with the old ones once again. You've made the transition often enough that

your shamanic persona is the living integration of all of your psychedelic experiences up to

that point in time. So let's say, in this case, 20 sessions in, working at the level of the

collective psyche into what I call the ocean of suffering, you stabilize a psychedelic

identity, a shamanic persona that integrates all the experiences that you have had of

transpersonal states of consciousness beyond your physical consciousness. If you are going to

go into yet a still deeper level of consciousness beyond where you had lived before, then that

shamanic persona has to die. It has to surrender in order for a new category instead

of a category of experiences to emerge and for a still deeper shamanic persona to

emerge. And so I think in some advanced sessions, what is dying is the previous identity

or the identity which we had developed from sustained psychedelic experiences over

many years. So that's I think the third thing is I would suggest it's what I call the shamanic

persona or the shamanic self is dying. It's not the egoic self. It's your psychedelic self,

which is dying. And then at a more subtle level, I think what is dying is actually some

dimension of consciousness itself. And this gets harder to discuss because it requires a more

subtle level of understanding. But basically, sometimes in my late work, when I was working

at very deep levels of consciousness, when I was working in deep levels of divine communion, I had

the experience that the divine level that I was experiencing came itself into a crescendo which

opened up a higher level of divine communion than had been actualized up to this point in

time. Sri Aurobindo says when he's talking in his metaphysical system, he says, looking down,

the divine sees all the levels of reality that it's manifested, but it's a one-way mirror.

So the divine looking down sees everything. But we, who are the divine looking up, tend to

see only the level that we are at. So it's a one-way mirror. And that means even at deep, deep

levels, so we'd say there are aspects of divine consciousness which cannot see or experience

into still deeper levels of divine consciousness. And somehow, when we do this work, we actually can

facilitate a communion which takes place between two different levels of divine consciousness, far

beyond space-time, far beyond personal reality. And there is a celebratory joy that takes place

when the divine wakes up to a still deeper level of the divine. There is a communion that takes

place. There is a joyful celebration when the higher is able to infuse itself more deeply into

the lower. And so I think that one of the things, one way of thinking about what dies in very

advanced stages is some aspect of divine consciousness itself. And yet, according

to your experiences, that death then precipitates a rebirth, typically. Did you

discover that with consciousness itself as well? Yes. Or the divine itself? Yeah, I mean,

it's, again, it's complicated because we're rushing into an area where angels fear to

tread. Right, we're trying to put language to an experience that many, sometimes, for

example, with near-death experiencers, they'll say it's ineffable. So I

understand there's a language barrier. Well, there is a language barrier, but for me,

the biggest issue is not the language barrier. It is to lay the foundation, to lay the

prerequisites, to put things in place so that you people can understand the language that

you want to use to describe these phenomena. And it's not ordinary day language. It's not

everyday experience. It requires kind of a conceptual reframe, a conceptual understanding,

so that you can describe certain things that lie far beyond our ordinary, sensate experience.

But in some ways, it's not that different from what a near-death episode person experiences. In

fact, I find, I feel the greatest correspondence and collegiality with people who have had

deep near-death episode experiences because deep NDEs are the experiences of the closest

correlate to my experience with deep psychedelic work. I think if you work with psychedelics

in a focused way over long periods of time, you can access the same dimensions of

consciousness that someone accesses with an NDE, a near-death experience. The difference is that

where for most people, the NDE-er experiences this only once in their life. With sustained

psychedelics, you can go back multiple times into this territory. And because you can go back

multiple times, you're taught there are more nuances that are brought out in terms of how

this all works in the interplay of consciousness. Can you help expand the conceptual framework

for us a little bit about what that experience has been like for you? Let me narrow it into

one particular, just to take one example. When I was into the work now, I guess, four or

five years into the work, and I began to get systematic access to archetypal reality, and I

began to have experiences. Every time I went into my session, I entered a level of reality that I

knew was more real than space-time. It was the primary reality. Space-time was the secondary

reality. I had encounters with vast beings that I could not comprehend. I could not wrap my mind

around them. But I knew that these were the beings who were responsible for creating space-time and

creating fundamental conditions within space-time. But to have access to these realities,

everything that I had known about human history, about human thought, everything about the history

of humanity had to fall away because the entire collective psyche had to fall away in order

to enter into levels of consciousness that humanity as a whole has not had access to or

has not experienced. Very few number of people have access to these deep dimensions of

reality. But even in archetypal reality, you're dealing with very profound levels of

consciousness, but there is still dualism there. There is still a sense of self and other,

archetype and self, different archetypes. There is a dualistic quality to it. When I went

beyond archetypal reality into causal reality, that's the signature of causal reality that all

dualisms dissolve so that you begin to experience the world in whatever aspect you're experiencing

it. You're experiencing the world as a unified, single entity, a single consciousness.

I think it was Plotinus who says, the world breathes as one. And that's the

experience there, that there is a radical transparency that opens where you are

fundamentally encountering the wholeness of life that doesn't negate differentiation. In fact, it

affirms differentiation, but that differentiation is experienced as different manifestations

of this single, integrated, whole, undivided reality that we call God or we call the divine

or the one. That's a different category of experience altogether from archetypal reality.

Can you share a little bit more about why it's termed archetypal reality or that layer for

those who maybe aren't familiar with archetypes? I use the term archetype in two senses here.

One is Jung talked about archetypes as the primary themes, the repetitive themes of human

experience that become concretized in forms, old man, old woman, trickster,

jokester, those clacks of shadow. And then, so I think of them as kind of

archetypal in the sense of the primary, the dominant themes of the

collective psyche. I see. The second way in which archetypes

is used is in the Platonic tradition, where Plato talks about the discovery of a level

of reality that lies beyond time-space altogether. And I experience both. I experience Plato's

sense of archetypes. I experience that reality, but not in the way that Plato describes it. Plato

thinks of archetypes as eternal principles within an eternal being. So they are the unchanging

prototypes that are used in creation, and they exist within the mind of an unchanging divine,

unchanging infinite being. That's not how I experience those archetypes. I experience them

as living entities, but living on a vast scale of time and space, far beyond anything that we

know inside time and space. But what is shared is that for something to manifest inside time

and space, it comes out of the oneness through these fundamental intermediate structures,

which are very profound, super-intelligent, super-powerful structures, and then focusing

this energy down into concretizing it, concretizing it, into eventually manifesting

in space-time reality as we know it. When I experience the collective psyche, and

I experience a lower level of archetypes, in Jung's sense of archetypes, it was similar to

Jung's sense in that there were these archetypal themes within humanity, but I did not experience

what Jung experienced as archetypes. I didn't have the experience of wise old man, wise old woman,

things like this. It's not that I don't think those exist. What I experienced was humanity as

a single organism, over and over and over again, as a single organism, and that there

were metameridians within humanity that wove all of our individual lives into

the life of the human species as a whole. So I learned that our minds are woven into the

collective mind. They are aspects. They are seed crystals within the collective mind. Even our

bodies and the diseases that we have to manage are all part of the body of humanity

evolving itself over long periods of time. So it was archetypal in the sense of

trans-individual motifs within the human psyche, but it wasn't quite the way Jung

conceptualized it. So basically, archetypes in this way reflect the insight

that there are dominant structures that are supra-personal. They go beyond the

functioning of individual beings, and then in platonic sense, there are

metaphysical archetypes that basically inform manifestation of time and space itself.

So at the causal level, you mentioned this is where you connect with the divine intelligence,

what we perceive as God. I imagine there may be people listening wondering,

did you discover that there is a God? I generally tend not to like to use God language,

though I do. The reason I don't like to use God language is because as someone who knows the

history of world religions pretty well, I also know all the theologies that have gone into

God language, and all the cultural limitations that go into it, and all the abuse that went into

it, and all the crimes and the horrible things that have been done in the name of God. And

certainly, I'm not talking about God in anything like that. And so I would use the word the divine

instead of God, but that's really that's just an end run, because even the concept of the divine

carries into it certain carryovers from our time-space experience. And so on the one hand,

I want to affirm the idea that there is this profound generative intelligence

manifesting as time and space, that time and space is not something

which is independent of the divine, but it is a classic Hindu thinking, it is

the manifestation of the body of the divine. So in that way, I want to affirm a

very wide vision of the divine, of God. But because I've gone so deeply into the future,

and so deeply beyond space and time so many times, my understanding or my feeling

for this cosmic principle, I can't fit it inside the theologies of the

religions of the world. It's just it's much larger than that. And so on the one hand, okay,

I can call it God, but then I have to qualify that it's not this, it's not that, it's not what

you mean by God here, it's not what you mean by God there. Right, like a lot of people think of,

at least in the monotheistic traditions, think of individual or a being that were made in the form

of, right? And that's what I think people are maybe curious about is what you discovered as

far as, you know, did you connect with a being or beings or angels or other divine entities? And if

you could share a little bit about what that realm was like. In all the years when I was doing this

work and all the work I did, I never encountered a being, a divine beings that I'm God, you know,

this is what I am. It wasn't like that. It was like, I would go deeper into a level of

consciousness and I would experience a communion with this consciousness. And this consciousness

would teach me, it knew me, it would teach me and show me things and it would crush me and

then bring me forward into still deeper levels. And I would go into those deeper levels and I

would enter into communion with those levels and I internalized the energy of those

levels and I was with this consciousness. But it never crystallized into a specific form. I

always felt its presence. It guided my sessions. I could enter into dialogue with it. I

could enter into communion with it. It would dissolve me into

itself. But it never crystallized into what you might call a

personality of God or a person of God. And it just kept getting larger and larger,

deeper and deeper, more and more vast. And I think that many of our theologies of God

or our thinking about God is really based upon what I would call the early

encounters with an infinite intelligence. That this infinite intelligence

is far larger, far too large to ever be concretized in the historical

lineages that we recognize in the world traditions. It's infinite in itself.

In fact, when I was in the deepest level of consciousness that I ever went into when I was in

the diamond luminosity work, and that's the work that occupied me for the last five years, when I

was as deep into the diamond luminosity as I had ever entered and I was far beyond time-space

reality, I was dissolved into the luminous, you might say the body of the divine, all of

a sudden my visual field turned 90 degrees, a window opened up, and I saw reality far, far in

the distance. And I saw a light in that reality, and a beam of light came out of that reality

and hit me. And I was in the diamond luminosity condition. But this light was so powerful,

it shattered my mind. And it took me minutes to recover from this. And that's when I began to

realize it's an infinite progression. The divine is truly an infinite reality. Even using this

powerful method, I would never get to the end of this reality. And that's one of the reasons

why I would be much gentler with myself if I were doing this again today. Because I discovered,

see, when I began this work, I thought that the purpose was to reach a state of consciousness, to

reach enlightenment, or to reach oneness with God, or to dissolve into the primal void. And I had

known oneness with God at many different levels, and I had entered into the primal void several

times, and I'd learned that there were different depths of the primal void. And so now I began to

understand that it's not about getting to some end state, which is going to magically transform

your life. It's a matter of opening up and letting the love and intelligence of the universe or the

divine into you as much as you can bring it in, as much as you can hold on to it, as much as

you can distill into the fabric of your living existence, your earthly existence. It's not about

getting to some end point. It's about deepening the ongoing communion that exists between

ourselves inside time and space and this larger spiritual reality. Very beautiful. Can you

share more with us about the diamond luminosity? Light surfaces many times in our psychedelic

work. I mean, every time you go through a death rebirth experience, very

typically people encounter the light, many forms of light. And I had

encountered this light at many different levels along the journey. After I'd gone through ego

death, after I'd gone through the ocean of suffering work, after I'd gone through archetypal

reality, after I'd gone into the causal level reality, about 15 years into my work, when I had

been given so many spiritual treasures, I felt completely existentially satisfied. I mean, I just

I had been to experience radical Śūnyatā, emptiness of self, oneness of all existence

had been offered so many treasures. And then I went through yet another

cycle of death and rebirth. And I accessed a level of light, a dimension

of light, that was so pure and so clear, it absolutely stunned me. And it became my sole

objective in the rest of my psychedelic work to return to this reality. Because once you

touch what I'm calling the diamond luminosity, once you touch it, it's a reality which is so

far beyond anything that I had ever touched in any of my earlier work, that I just lost interest

in archetypal reality, I lost interest in causal reality, I wanted to get back into this level of

reality. It's so pure, it's just breathtakingly magnificently pure, and the levels of ecstasy

associated with it are just staggering. And in the next five years of work, in 26 sessions,

which is one third of my entire journey, I only got access to this level of reality four times.

So in between those four sessions were lots of purification, more purification at a very

deep level, more learning, more teaching, but accessing this reality four times. And

I think as I look at the world's literature, the spiritual literature, and Buddhist literature

is probably the tradition that I know the best, they call this level of reality Dharmakāya, the clear light of absolute

reality. So it is considered in their tradition, the absolute foundational

reality of time and space, all time and space reality, all the galaxies, all the big bang emerge

out of this crystalline light, which is a pre samsaric, it's what we would

call an extra samsaric reality. It's outside of the cycle of space and

time. So it's outside of physical reality, and it's also outside of the bardos of postmortem

existence. It's outside of the entire system. Once you touch it, you're hopelessly in love with it

for the rest of your life. It just is something that illumines everything. I understood what

Buddhist meant when they said, touch it once, it can undo hundreds of years of living in the

shadows of karma. Because it has such a penetrating transformative

effect, impact, that just to touch it, it changes your whole understanding of

existence, and your whole experience of what it means to be alive. Is this also what

you refer to in your book as the beloved? Well, you know, everybody has to find a word to

describe this transcendent reality. We can talk about God, or we can talk about the divine. Some

people call it the absolute. Daoism calls it the eternal Dao. Jewish mysticism calls it the Ein

Sof, the great nothingness, the great emptiness. I call it my beloved, because in a path of

temporary immersion, you move into intimacy with this reality, and then you come back out of

it. And then you move into intimacy, and you come back out of it, and it becomes like a love

relationship. But it's a love relationship which actually dissolves the bodies of the two

different beings. The communion that arises is it's a deep and profound spiritual communion. And

so I just adopted the vocabulary that felt most natural to me, and I called it my beloved, the

beloved. And so yes, to me, the beloved manifests itself at all sorts of different levels.

It's manifesting itself at the early level, early stages,

the middle stages, and the advanced stages. But in the end,

you recognize that you're always in dialogue with this profound creative intelligence, which

interestingly enough feels more like a she, in my experience, than a he. And I associate the

feminine side of God with the act of creation. And what you might think of as the masculine side

of God, as the radically transcendent aspect of the basic idea is that the primal one divides

into two. One stays outside of space-time, the other manifests space and time, and

manifests all life within space and time. So for me, the beloved is more the feminine

side of the divine, the divine mother. Yes, it seems that light is a theme in your

experiences. And also, how much of a role did or does love play in

these experiences for you? It played, eventually, a very large

role. There were some sessions in which I encountered or was blessed with experiences of

cosmic love. And it's love not like anything I'd ever experienced before. It just absolutely

shatters me and overwhelmed me. I experienced that all of existence was generated not out of

simply a sheer power. Can you think of the power of the Big Bang and everything that emerged

from it? Not only the intelligence there, but that love, a profound cosmic love,

why is it the very act of creation itself? And that's obviously a kind of love that's not

like anything that we know in human parlance. It's not anything nearly that small. But it

is the fiber of the divine itself. And I think as love and oneness are kind of two

different sides of the reality. Because love, if the world is truly one, if it's all one,

love is the emotion of this oneness. Love is the fact of oneness asserting itself in a world of

duality. Yeah, love has been really important, which really surprised me because of the four

yogas in Hinduism, Jñāna, the path of the mind, Rāja, the path of meditation, Karma yoga, Bhakti

yoga, Bhakti yoga, the yoga of loving devotion. It's a form of yoga that I identified with the

least. I've always been more intellectually oriented, meditatively oriented, not Bhakti

oriented. And yet I began to have a series of very profound Bhakti experiences that it's kind

of what led me to talk about the beloved in this very lover kind of context. How much

is love the fabric of the divine? Anything I say at this point, I mean, first

of all, please forgive my hubris at daring to describe the nature of the divine. I mean,

come on, get real. I mean, this is just like... So anything I say is going to be totally

inadequate to the reality itself. So we describe the divine nature as infinite

knowledge, infinite power, infinite love. All of those are equally true, and I'm

sure that there are other qualities which we want to add to that.

But let's start with those three. The challenge, I think, of understanding

the love aspect of the divine is because life as we experience it is an often dirty, nasty, mean,

cruel thing. And so any suggestion that somehow the world as we know it with all of its pain and suffering is somehow a manifestation of a

supremely loving consciousness, it's horrendously difficult to reconcile those. And I understand

that. I mean, as a philosopher of religion, I understand the challenge. And I think the only

way of overcoming that challenge is to really understand the deep structure or the deep

intentionality that's manifesting itself in the creation itself, in our evolving

universe, in the project of the universe. You have to radically expand your time horizon to

understand what's taking place here. You have to understand that the human condition as we

currently know it is just a small dot in a long developmental process that not only has been

going on for 13.7 billion years, but will continue to go on for 13.7 plus more years. So that, as

Sri Aurobindo said, we are a transitional species. We are actualizing ourselves within a long

developmental trajectory. And if we think that, well, God must not be real because we could

have done a better job creating the universe. If I had infinite power, I could have certainly

created a better universe than this where children die and all the terrible things that happen to

us. But that assumes that we know what the divine intention is, what the project of existence is.

And I think we are like children in a playpen. We are just beginning to get a grip on the

enormity of the project of existence. We're just beginning, really since Hubble, in modern

theories of cosmology, beginning to understand the size and depth and textures. I think

psychedelics are kind of like the Hubble of psychological insight. They are giving us an

experience of the depth in which consciousness exists. But that just gets us at the beginning

of beginning to comprehend what is the project. What will humanity be five billion years from

now? What will we be a million years from now, or even a hundred thousand years from now?

The divine seems to think on that scale. So we have to radically stretch

ourselves to think on that scale. So the problem of suffering really challenges

our understanding of the role of love, the principle of love in the divine nature. But

once we have an experiential access to some of the deeper trajectories of the divine

intent, then things begin to make more sense. I think the divine is creating a masterpiece.

I mean, I think refined, elevated, potentiated human experience is a masterpiece

of creation that takes thousands, thousands, millions of years, billions of years

to orchestrate and to bring forward, especially since it's not done. We intentionally

cooperate and participate in this creative process. It's not being done to us. It's

something we are carrying forward in the very fiber of our being. But we really have

to kind of grasp the scale of things to even understand our present circumstances.

At the same time, it sounds like you found that the Atman is Brahman, that you found that we are

part of the divine and the divine is part of us. Yeah. And really, there's very little that's

new in any of the experiences that I lay out. The vision of reality, the cosmology that emerges

out of psychedelic work is fundamentally the same as the cosmology that emerges out of deep mystical

spiritual traditions in the very highest and most refined levels of spiritual traditions in the

world. It's not that we're bringing something new to the table, maybe a little bit, but we're

not bringing a whole lot of new to the table. What we have is a different protocol, a different

strategy for accessing these very deep levels of reality, which yield deep insights into the

structure of existence. But you will find the same fundamental cosmology emerging out of

the great spiritual traditions of the world. Since you brought up the

Hubble telescope, and we've primarily been talking about what we consider

just another word as consciousness, what did you discover in our universe, what we consider

as sort of the physical universe, what we consider as space or outer space?

Did you traverse that aspect of experience in your sessions?

I wasn't taken into journeys into our galaxy or journeys into other galaxies.

That just wasn't part of the work for me. Other people may have those experiences or have had

those experiences. So while I was given this particular session called the cosmic tour,

I called it the cosmic tour, where I was taken on this cosmic tour

and shown so many things, much of which I could not reproduce when I

came back into my time-space consciousness, because my time-space consciousness just did

not have the vocabulary, the intellectual tools to articulate those. That's why I've often wished

that I had a PhD in physics and astrophysics, that I would better be able to articulate

some of the experiences that I was given. But I didn't spend a lot of time traveling

within time and space. It was more a matter of going underneath time and space and getting into

the underlying deep structure that informs time and space and our experience in time and space.

I feel like I recall in your book that you were shown that the universe, I think you've already

said this, goes on and on essentially. Is that right? Do I recall that correctly? Yeah.

Basically, there are two different models of the universe. One is that it'll keep expanding

forever. And the other is that we reach a point where there's a maximum expansion, and then

it begins a contraction. So is it a pulsating universe, expanding and contracting, and then

re-expanding? Or is it an infinitely expanding universe? I don't really have an

answer to that particular question, but clearly the universe is

just, it's on a tear. It's on a tear. It's going on for billions

and billions and billions of years. Now, that's a deflating insight if you think that

a human being is simply a 100-year-old being. If we're simply a 100-year-old being, then we're

basically sand on the beach beside the ocean. We don't really get to participate in that deep

future. But if reincarnation is true, and I think there's plenty of factual evidence that it's true,

if reincarnation is true, and if it's true that our essence is indestructible, and that we take

everything that we've learned and roll it over to continue learning over thousands and thousands

and millions of years, then we get to actually participate in this divine unfolding. It's not

somebody else's future or some other future, but it's our future. We are co-participants,

eternal participants in this eternal process. Mm-hmm. In your experiences, you talked

about the birth of the future human. Yeah. Can you shed a little

light on what that is about? Yeah. Yeah, there's a chapter in the book

called The Birth of the Future Human, and I really think this is maybe the

most important chapter of the book, and it's also the one that

caught me completely by surprise. I wasn't expecting anything like this in my

journey. I thought first it was a personal journey about personal healing,

personal awakening. Then when that expanded, I still thought, okay,

it's a journey about an individual being given experiences that provide insight into the deep

structure underlying our lives. But then about halfway through my work, starting in around 1990

and continuing through 1995, I began to be given a series of visions that were internally consistent,

that were dropped into my sessions talking about humanity's evolutionary destiny,

where humanity was in its evolutionary journey, that we were coming into a

turning point in history, that we were coming into a culmination, a crescendo of the

evolutionary journey that was going to catalyze a transformation inside humanity that would

mark a true before and after moment in time. There was a profound spiritual transformation

that was coming to a crescendo, coming to a head, and this kept repeating itself

in my work in different ways. But I did not know how the universe was ever

going to pull this off. It didn't show me how it was going to happen. Then about a year and

a half later, when I was in the middle of the diamond luminosity work, so I was working

at a very deep level, in one particular day, I was given an experience taken far into

the future. I had died and dissolved into the human psyche. So when I say I was taken

into the future, it's not so much that Chris Bache was taken into the future. It's like, as

the human family, I experienced the human family in a trans-temporal dimension of

time, in a time-expanded state, and I experienced in an accelerated way the

death and rebirth of the entire human family. I experienced a profound geopolitical crisis that

seemed to be being seeded by a cascading series of ecological crises, but I experienced some type

of fundamental loss of control, an unraveling of life at the basic level, a tremendous global

crisis that was so deep and so profound that no one was going to be able to isolate

themselves or protect themselves from it. It was a crisis so deep

it was going to bring humanity to our collective knees.

But just when the crisis reached its peak, I experienced that we moved through it, and then

there was the beginning of a lightning. We made it through this crisis, and when we began to pick

ourselves up in this post-crisis period of history, we've discovered

that we had been profoundly changed. Something happened in this crisis that

opened us up, changed us at the very center of our being. One way of talking about it is that

there was a birth of oneness, that oneness, instead of being a private mystical experience

of a very select few, oneness was born within the human psyche as a whole. We tapped into a certain

depth of our nature that allowed us to become, first of all, it allowed us to become no

longer enemies with all of the human beings, all the divisions of history that have been used

to justify differences of race, differences of class structure, differences of religion, all

those differences which we think of and have used to divide history, national identity, all those

were dissolved, all those were transcended, and we began to experience a fundamental

oneness at the core of our life and all life itself. This led to creativity began to reinforce

itself, and we began to create new social forms, new structures. Eventually, over time, I

came to understand that what this was about was that there was a pressure building

up within the collective psyche, and that this pressure was taking humanity

through a collective death-rebirth process that represented a fundamental irreversible shift

in the collective psyche. I think of it as a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche so

that any child born after we make this transition will be operating within a psychic field which

is fundamentally different, more elevated, more spiritually informed

than we are operating out of now or we've been operating out of the past. This isn't simply a crisis with economic

ramifications or industrial ramifications or political or civic ramifications. It's

a revolution in the fundamental structure of the human psyche. It's a revolution in our

human nature. Now, I think that we have entered this period, this process. I think we're in

the very early stages of it. We're just getting started on it. I think the

21st century will be pivotal in going through this transformative crisis.

I wasn't given a lot of details on names, dates, and places and stuff like that. What I was given

was this core experience of what it's going to feel like for the human

family when they go through a collective dark night of the soul, go through

a collective ordeal that eventually will awaken an underlying revolution in the human psyche,

a spiritual opening of the human psyche. Now, I'm not alone. This is nothing unique to me.

This is an insight that many spiritual teachers have had, many indigenous people

have had. Many psychedelicists have tapped into this understanding.

I think this is the flow of history underneath us that we can tap into in different ways. I think

many of the spiritual mystical traditions have tapped into and begin to

understand some of this dynamic, but I think we're coming into a century

where we are at a critical turning point. I really believe that the 21st century is

pivotal here because if we just look at the scientific data on the ecological crisis,

if we look at what is now an increasingly shared understanding of the depth of

ecological disruption that we're going into and the change of interrupting. Well, I won't

go into the scientific material but clearly we cannot continue on earth operating the

way that we had been operating in the past. We don't have enough resources. Inequality is

just too extreme. I don't think we can continue to govern the earth out of the psychological

structure of the ego. The ego is fundamentally a divided psychic structure. I think the ego

is a beautiful thing. It's a magnificent thing but it fundamentally is cut off from the core of

existence, the foundation of existence and each other. We need to evolve into a higher level of

consciousness which is post-egoic in order to have the wisdom to rise to the challenges that

the ego has created for humanity over its last 1000 year history. And I think we will. I think

we will come through this crisis. I think we're going to go through unbelievable suffering in

the centuries ahead but I do believe that we come through it because that at least has been the

nature of my experience. We do come through this and humanity does make this evolutionary pivot.

Well, I know there's more you can share about this topic and I think we'll do a whole other

conversation about the birth of a future human and also we want to talk more about reincarnation.

Can you share why you stopped these LSD sessions in 1999? Well, I talk about this in the book

in the last chapter coming off the mountain and I basically boil it down to two reasons,

pain and heartache. My subtle energy system, psychedelic states open you up to huge flows of

energy. You're taking in enormous flows of energy. It takes years and years to manage the flows

of energy and I basically realized that I was running so hot that even months after my session

was over, I was permanently uncomfortable in my body because of the quantity of energy that was

running in my subtle energy system, my chi system or my prana. So that was telling me that it was

time to let my body calm down and let that subtle energy system find a new equilibrium point. But

the main reason I stopped was because of heartache because once you dissolve into the divine light,

once you dissolve into diamond luminosity and dissolve into the crystalline nature of

consciousness at this very, very deep level, coming back into time and space is just difficult.

It's very hard. You lose your zest for living inside time and space when you know how much more

is available to you outside of time and space. And going into and coming out of and going into

and coming out of this just became too painful. And so eventually my beloved and I came

to an agreement that I would not return to these states of consciousness

until I could stay with her forever. And that's really what lies behind

my stopping. I just had to stop and for the rest of my life focus on internalizing

the gifts that I had already been given rather than trying to acquire

or be given more gifts. You've been in communication with Stanislav Grof

and Ralph Metzner who are pioneers in this area of psychedelics and psychological

consciousness, cosmic exploration. Have you shared your experiences with them

and what have they shared with you about that? I've been in dialogue with both of them and I have

shared my sessions with Stan and he quotes from some of my sessions scattered throughout his

books. Some of them are anonymous and in some later works they're identified as mine.

And Stan very graciously wrote a beautiful forward to my book Dark Night Early Dawn which

was my first major book on psychedelic work, psychedelic theory. I think that there's a

fundamental, I mean we have different projects, different agendas. I mean Stan is a therapist,

he's a world healer. He has worked with thousands of individuals and collected thousands and

thousands of session experiences and organized them into an understanding

of the vast scope of the landscape that one experiences in these states. My work has been different. I've really been

doing an individual journey penetrating deeper and deeper into the universe. So I see

our work as complementary in that way. But yeah, I've been in dialogue with both

of them. Yeah, I love them both very dearly. Ralph has now transitioned on. I love them dearly.

We've been in dialogue. Ralph gave me feedback on LSD and the Mind of the Universe before I

published it. So yeah, I consider them close colleagues and good friends. So they were

supportive of your process? Yes, yeah. That's wonderful. The last area I want to touch

on with you is that of course people listening, some may think, well how much can we trust

these experiences? And I know that you had a conversation or an interaction with Kenneth

Ring who is the co-founder of the International Association for Near Death Studies. I was

wondering if you could share a little bit about your correspondence with him or what you have to

say about how much we can trust your experiences? Yeah, that's a really important question. I

mean, how do we know that we aren't simply exploring some hidden corner of my

personal unconscious or even some hidden corner of the collective psyche, I

mean, I know I understand how radical the assertions that I'm making, making them sound

almost cavalier. How do we know that we can trust these experiences to be what I'm suggesting that

they are? And Ken Ring and I had a dialogue about this. Ken is a wonderful scholar and he's a good

friend. And so after he had read LSD and the Mind of the Universe, he wrote me and we went back and

forth around precisely this issue. How trustable are these deep psychedelic experiences? How

do we know that they're not better understood as a manifestation of something coming out of

the personal psyche or the collective psyche, that they really have these metaphysical

ontological ramifications that I've been interpreting them to have? And so he and I went

back and forth in an exchange of letters about this. And Ken worked me over pretty hard. I mean,

he was asking hard questions and I loved it. And this was a dialogue that was

worth sharing. So we wrote it up in an essay called Are Deep Psychedelic

Experiences Trustable? And we published it online and it's available. If you just Google that title,

you'll find it. And in it, I try to address that specific issue. And I also bring in

other people's experiences which provide levels of objective verification, because

many psychedelic experiences lead us to have experiences that can be verified

because they relate to something inside time and space. The deeper cosmological experiences

cannot be verified in that way, but the existence of verifiable experiences when they refer to time

and space reality certainly points to the credibility of the deeper

cosmological experiences. So I bring in a lot of evidence in the footnotes

and in the literature that speak to the issue of the trustability of these experiences. I

think most of our doubt about their trustability is completely understandable, but I think it comes

from, first, not having personal experience of these states and trying to understand them within

a metaphysical framework that's based upon time of physical sensation experience, mental

experience, sensate experience. We're trying to understand these things within a framework

which is smaller than we want they need to be. It's just like we had to have tens of thousands

of near-death episodes in print and published before the medical community began to take them

seriously because they didn't want to interpret these as an indication of the existence of

spiritual reality. They wanted to interpret it as something going on inside

the physical process. And I think that's true for psychedelic experiences

too. We need to develop a more sophisticated ontology, metaphysical understanding,

even to have a framework for understanding some of these experiences. And this is why

I didn't rush into print on any of these experiences. I mean, after I stopped my work in

99, I really spent 20 years digesting them, analyzing, looking at other people's experiences,

looking at the other metaphysical systems, and trying to put all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle

together before I published LSD in the Mind of the Universe. So a lot of thought, it's not simply,

here's my experience, you can trust it because I had it. It's not that at all. What we really want

is not just one person's experiences, but we want to have a critical protocol which involves

many people's experiences, putting all of our experiences on the table and finding out which

of these experiences are idiosyncratic and which one of them are common ground.

We haven't really begun that work yet. We're in the early stages of doing that. But psychedelics

are not going to go away. We're going to be using them for decades and hundreds of years to come.

And this challenge of collective verification of the visions that emerge in these states

is just getting started, is just moving forward. It sounds like you're suggesting that

we need more research in this area, which can be tricky because of the taboo and

the legalities around it. Although it seems that with other studies on psilocybin and other

psychedelics that maybe that's beginning to shift. I think it is beginning to shift. I think

what's happening is the psychedelic community is demonstrating with increasing convincing

research that these substances have a tremendous power to heal. And that's what's bringing them

back into public discussion. We're going to find over time that the same amplifying qualities

which allow them to have a therapeutic impact continue. If we continue to apply these

methodologies, they continue to open up deeper and deeper levels of consciousness. And

when we get deep enough, eventually we'll begin to harvest the philosophical and cosmological

significance of these substances. I gave a talk at the Erotas Conference at Oxford last fall,

and I called it Seizing the Philosophical and Cosmological Significance of Psychedelics. We're

not there yet, but I think we're going there. We will get there to move in this direction.

Well, Chris, I know this is a very large topic, and I just want to ask this last question,

and I'm excited we're going to have another conversation. Is there anything you want to share

more today about psychedelics and the cosmic mind? I want to return again to the cautionary

words that we shared in the very beginning. This is deep, challenging, demanding work. You

do not try to climb Mount Everest unless you have all the best equipment and all the best guides

going with you. You do not want to go deep into the psyche unless you have all the best equipment

and the best context for doing this type of work. So I want to affirm that. I want to affirm

the importance of a rigorous protocol. If you want to go deep, you have to have a

particularly rigorous protocol, first just to survive the encounter, but also to take

experiences and distill them into increasingly clear, clear, articulate experiences that are

not lost. Your mind just doesn't swallow them up. You can really bring back the core of the

experience. Once you do that, once you've taken all the cautions, all the precautions, and once

you have spent time doing your due diligence in this, then I think we are at the cusp of

a completely new chapter in philosophy of consciousness, a new chapter in our understanding

what is happening in existence. Why is human existence the way it is? Why is existence the way

it is? What's going on underneath the surface? What is the nature of the intelligence

that's manifesting the body of the universe? What is the nature of the

intelligence manifesting inside our own hearts and mind over time?

This, I think, is the beginning of a whole new chapter of philosophical and

spiritual reflection. In conclusion, I just want to leave with your viewers a sense of

excitement or this tremendous turning point that we are at, this pivot point of this profound

deepening of our understanding of our experience of these deep structures of reality and a

deepening of our understanding of what's taking place behind the scenes and the opportunity

to enter into conscious communion with the of our existence, which was previously maybe

just the privileged domain of very, very advanced meditative and contemplative mystics, but now

we have a new modality that allows even ordinary human beings to have just a touch taste of

these experiences, which can be life-changing. And for people to know the risks and the benefits,

right? Because each person might have a different reaction or response to these kinds of

substances. Yeah, there are screening criteria and more important, more criteria that

would be… which are used in order to make sure people who do this

work are safe and only people who should do this work do do this work.

Chris, thank you so much for being with me today. Thank you so much for going beyond the beyond and

bringing it back for all of us. I really have enjoyed our conversation and I look forward to

our next one. Thank you, Emmy. I have enjoyed our conversation too. Thank you for the work you're

doing. We need all the wisdom we can get in the years ahead. Yes. And for those of you watching

or listening, thank you for being with us because you are the reason that we are here.

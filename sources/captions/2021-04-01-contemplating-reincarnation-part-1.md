Welcome, everyone,

to a series of talks that I'm doing here with my friend Chris Bache,

and we're going to be discussing a subject that we're both really interested

in and fascinated by, which is rebirth and all the things

that go along with rebirth. Might also call it reincarnation,

because that's part of the story. And this began, really,

because I read a book by Chris, a wonderful book called 'LSD

and the Mind of the Universe'. And what it did is it kind of just

triggered a real recognition in me. And since I'm a teacher of spiritual matters and I'm the founder

of a system called the Gene Keys, that resonance that went off in me, it caused me to reach out via

email to this amazing man. And you never know whether you're

going to hear back in those instances. And Chris very kindly got back to me

and we started a series of dialogues and discussions, and we realised that we

really enjoyed having dialogues together. So that's why we're here. And we're going to explore this

subject in several sessions. So, today, we're going to just begin with some introductory concepts and basics

and then see where it leaves us. So I hope you enjoy it and I'm

very much looking forward to it. And we're anticipating three discussions.

Absolutely. So Chris, if you want to say a few things about yourself, just so that

people know who you are. It's a pleasure to meet here. And I've enjoyed our conversations

that we've had prior to this. And this present dialogue grew out

of those earlier conversations. I am a professor of philosophy

and religious studies. I'm on the religious

studies side of the shop. I'm retired from Youngstown

State University. In the course of my teaching, I've taught courses on world religions

and Eastern religions, transpersonal psychology of religion

and comparative mysticism, Buddhism. So I've been teaching in areas touching

on reincarnation for many years. I have written several books. My first one was on reincarnation,

starting with the scientific evidence for reincarnation, which

we'll be touching on today. And it's been seminal in my thinking. And I just believe that reincarnation is one of those concepts that is

like plate tectonics. If you-- at first it's hard to see because it's not obvious, but, once you

see it, it changes everything. It changes so much, it opens

up the horizon of existence. So we thought this would be a good topic to have a shared conversation about

and I'm just real pleased to be here. Great.

Thanks, Chris. And I mean,

we'll put the link in afterwards, but there's some great things,

talks that you've done, and particularly one which I watched

fairly recently about 'Is there evidence for reincarnation?'

And it's so illuminating and extraordinary, and kind

of overlooked by so many people. Tell us some of

the, you know, your story in assembling and amassing that, some of that evidence,

or meeting other people that have. Well, you know, I came from a traditional

religious background, but over the course of many years

of graduate education I finished my doctoral work in philosophy religion,

as an atheistically inclined agnostic. Basically I'd studied my way

out of religion altogether. So I started my academic career as a young man, a long time ago in 1978,

and I met there the work of two people, in my first year, and both of them

changed the course of my life. The first was Ian Stevenson, the Carlson Professor at the University

of Virginia, whose lifelong work has been to provide carefully documented cases

that clearly-- of young children, small children who have spontaneous

memories of their previous life. And then researching these children

from all over the world, collecting thousands of cases,

publishing hundreds of cases. And he convinced me that reincarnation

was a simple fact of life. That's quite a book, isn't it?

That's a big book he's written. The book. He's written about, oh,

I think close to a dozen now, but this first one was called '20

Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation'. And, to me, it was a life pivot, because reincarnation was never

discussed in my graduate education. It was never discussed in the West

religions, or in the scientific tradition that had kind of wiped the slate clean

for-- of the religious traditions. So I just erased my blackboard and began to rethink again the larger questions

of life incorporating reincarnation. The second person I met at that time was Stanislav Grof,

who is the foremost authority on integrating psychedelics

into psychotherapy. And he was providing a methodology

that actually allows one to explore the deeper dimensions

of one's own consciousness. So that began a whole 'nother journey, a second journey which culminated

eventually in the publication of this book Richard mentioned,

'LSD in the Mind of the Universe'. But today the focus here is

on Ian Stevenson's - what he started in the revolution

of really providing carefully documented evidence that reincarnation is

just simply a fact of life. It's not a religious thing. It's not a-- it's simply a natural

phenomenon that's happening in the world. And in your talk you gave,

again which the link will be here-- as a wonderful, you know, years spent as an academic,

you kind of argue both sides. So you show how different people have come in and even written books to refute those

things, but how they've fallen short. And so there's this whole story around it. And there's this growing body of evidence,

that maybe in the last 50 years has been documented, I mean it's

fairly recent, isn't it? It is recent. 50 years ago, we didn't

have this evidence. It was still-- reincarnation was a speculative topic that the theologians

argued back and forth on. But now it's moved from the theologians'

table to the psychologists' table. And now, as we explore more deeply, the deeper levels of consciousness

in the depth-psychology tradition, we just find we're bumping into th

ese events over and over again. Now, the western philosophical tradition, of course, is kind of still saturated

with the metaphysical position of naturalism, which says, 'The only thing

which is real is that which is physical.' So, therefore, the brain

produces your mind. So obviously, in that system, once your brain dies, your mind 'psss'

\[makes sound effect\] ceases to exist. So it's impossible for there to be

something like reincarnation, because it implies a dimension of reality

that's behind the physical world. If you exist there for any-- consciousness

can exist there for any interval of time , between the death of one personality

and the birth of a second personality. So, naturally, there's been a real push back from philosophical

traditions in the West. Mostly they've just ignored the evidence. They don't look at it,

and even those who look at it and engage it, the foremost critic that I mentioned

in my talk was a man named Paul Edwards, a substantial American philosopher,

even in his work - the evidence really a careful, dispassionate analysis

of the debate between Ian Stevenson on the one hand,

and Paul Edwards on the other hand, is that he just refuses to look seriously

at the evidence, because he's convinced beforehand that the evidence must

be somehow faulty, because we know that reincarnation can't happen. Yeah, of course, and that's often the way

with academics sometimes, isn't it? And, you know, a great-- you know, so that's, like, that's really

interesting in itself, just the evidence. And I don't think we need to kind of go

any more into that now but it's-- I guess what are the implications, you know, if we do-- Because this year I've done

a series of videos myself, short ones, just exploring the implications of 'What

if I say yes to this concept, and I explore it?' You know,

if I open my mind and my heart to it, and I begin to really

deeply explore it. You know, the implications to our world view, and the way we

move through life is huge, isn't it? Yeah. It all hinges on time. How much time we have. Because if you

have a sense of-- well, let me back up. I'm a professor. So if I give a quiz in class, I can expect

a certain quality of an answer back. If I give an exam that takes an hour,

I expect a higher quality of response. And if it's a take-home research paper, I have higher expectations, still,

because they have more time. So, philosophically, if we believe we only live on Earth one time,

and we only have in some cases a few minutes, to as many as 100 years,

and we extrapolate from that - if there is a purpose to existence,

that purpose must be proportionate to the amount of time we

have to fulfil that purpose. But if we have a hundred lifetimes,

a thousand lifetimes, in which to actualise the purpose

of the universe, then I think it expands exponentially our potential assessment of

what the purpose of existence might be. And that's why it's such an important

philosophical discussion, because once you understand the dynamics

of reincarnation, once you grasp the fundamental principle,

then it lifts the constriction of time, and it allows us to begin to think

in terms of, and appreciate and understand,

the larger patterns of the pulse of cause and effect overarching

over centuries of time. And it just elevates the whole discussion.

Absolutely. And I think, like-- you know, if I can be

blunt, like, if you have an inherent sense of a divinity

behind creation, then it seems logical to extend that into,

you know, that this concept of generosity. Because if you had a divinity and you only

have one life, it's very stingy, it seems. Like, it doesn't seem to have any

kind of pattern or reason to it. You know, it's like, for me, life is just-- spirit is just filled

with generosity in terms of time. And if we kind of open to the eternal

nature of life, then of course that would make sense, for

there to be a continuity of consciousness. And I think that, you know,

the more people open to this, the more they kind of realise it

has some deep root inside them. You know, I discovered that a lot because I've

begun to talk about it more and more. And one of the things I realised is no one

else really much-- other than people who are doing past-life regression

therapeutically, a lot of the teachers and spiritual teachers in the world

today avoid this subject. I mean, I don't know if they consciously

avoid it, but they don't talk about it. I mean, they get asked questions,

but then their answers are kind of generally quite short,

and it doesn't get picked up. So, yeah, I'm really interested

in something that is passed over that is so obvious, and it should be

in plain view for all of us. Isn't that curious? I mean,

I understand why my colleagues at the University who tended to be

you know materialists and reductionists. That I understand. But why spiritual teachers

wouldn't talk about it? Or wouldn't use it to sort of frame a larger and expanded horizon? Sometimes

I've heard people say, 'Well, it can dilute your intensity

of commitments for realisation in the present.' But, you know,

if you think you have many lifetimes and you're not going to take

this lifetime as seriously. But I think that argument kind of evaporates quickly

once you look at it carefully. I think it deepens the textures of the

situations in which we find ourselves in. And let me just give you one example. Some of the research,

Michael Newton's research, for example, in his book 'Journeys of the Soul' and

'Destiny of Souls', he and other past life therapists have found evidence

that we choose our incarnation. Now, I think in some ways many people don't, they may kind of go very

haphazardly and take what's available, but as you get mature,

you choose your incarnation carefully. Now, if we choose our incarnation carefully,

when there was a time when we knew more than we know now, and we could see more

than we could see now, if we chose the life that we're living

now, with all of its ups and downs and challenges and opportunities,

then doesn't that change how we might relate to those very circumstances

in which we find ourselves? You know, not to go chasing

all sorts of hidden mission-- you know, hidden meanings,

but to basically temper the quality of the self-responsibility that we use

in how we engage the people that we're with, the circumstances

that we find ourselves in. Yeah.

And doesn't it make you also-- I mean, for me, it makes me feel more like

a kind of eternal, cosmic adventurer. So, you know, it enrichens

this time I'm in now. It actually, in

many ways it focuses me a lot more into the present, because I'm not worrying

about dying, if you know what I mean. It changes that. And it's not just a concept. You know, have to go-- you know, this is my understanding, through my teaching,

is you have to contemplate something very deeply like this, for it to start

to kind of take root in you. And then as it takes root in you, it brings out of your-- literally,

I feel the truth of it is in our DNA. It's, like, in us. So once that gets triggered,

that kind of awakening of the memory, it-- there's a sort of certainty and a stability that grows inside us,

that enables us to handle whatever challenges come to us in a really

much more powerful way, because we're rooted in this kind

of eternal acceptance of this. You know, you hear

it all the time, on people on the radio. I heard last week, like, someone just

saying, 'Well, you've only got one life. So you've got to, you know, really make

the most of it.' Which is a great thing to say, but it's also, you

have only got one life. It's just, I

keep coming back to, that's really a tight kind of reality from whichever belief

system you're operating out of. Cuts the legs right out from under you. Because correlating with that is usually

the ideas of: you exist and the universe is being driven by blind chance,

it's just random mutation, there's no existential significance

to the circumstances in which you find yourself in, so you only get one shot,

make the best of it, but then when you die, it's gone,

you're gone anyway, so who cares? And that's just such a demeaning and counterintuitive

philosophy of life. Because I think when we look at the beauties of nature,

when we look at the night sky, when we see the pictures from the Hubble

telescope of the magnificent patterns in the deep cosmos, when we look around us

at Earth and look at the depth of the emergence of life and the emergence

of self-awareness on the planet over time, all these projects take place

over enormous sweeps of time. And we are the first generation to really

appreciate how much time the universe has had to be evolving

into the form that it is. Now, if the universe and everything it's

doing takes enormous amounts of time and we only have one life,

then existentially, we're cut off. We're not-- we don't participate

in that massive project. But if we do part-- if we live multiple lifetimes, there's a good

news - bad news situation. You know, the bad news is, you know, well, it's hard work in this lifetime, and we'd

like to have it over with when we die. But if we keep coming back, you know,

there's a larger project afoot. You know, it's not a simple grade,

like we thought it was before. It's a whole university education. The good news is you're right. It drops away, the fear

of death drops away. I mean, it just drops away. The good news is it allows us to envision a deeper-- to feel into the deeper

currents of life and the deeper projects. And it allows us to begin to think

in terms of longer term projects. And I think this is one of the things you

see when people take to heart this idea, even without specific knowledge

of their former lives. I mean, that's interesting.

And that can be helpful. But even without that,

when you really let that in, and you look around you and you realise that every

person you're seeing has been here before and will be here again, it just allows

you to engage life with so much more meaning and intensity of the process. You know,

what we are good at are things we have practised in the past,

things that we are just getting started on are things will get

better at in the future. And we can think we have that much time. We can think in terms

of that larger landscape. Yeah and of course, you know, we're not-- you know, there are many great thinkers and philosophers

and sages who have come to the same conclusion about rebirth. And

notably among them in the West, because we can talk a little

bit about the Eastern views. It's pretty common in the East. But Jung is someone who obviously springs,

like, straight up into the centre fray, because he's a bit

more contemporary. And, you know, he's been this pillar of modern

psychology, in the way in which we now understand the unconscious, and

the collective unconscious, and mythology, and all these other transformational

kind of consciousness views. But he tended to hide his

belief in reincarnation. You know, he came to it kind of late

in life, and he began to hide it because he had pushed the boundaries so much

he was concerned about the backlash. But it's there in his work. And I think that's what

happens with a lot of people. I think they go 'Well, I'm not sure I want to go into that area'

because it's got a stigma attached to it. And it really has, hasn't it? Because the moment you say the word reincarnation,

you've got like a-- there's a whole kind of battery of sceptics coming at you.

Whether they're coming from Christianity or whether they're coming from, you know,

materialist science. You know, it's like you really put your

head above the parapet. For years, for decades, I was taking students into the

literature on reincarnation. And it's like you just-- once you put all that aside and you just look at the cases,

you just look the evidence. I mean, I found 95 percent of my students were able to overcome all kinds

of resistances, both secular and religious resistance, because they're trained

in our culture to follow the evidence. Once they saw the evidence and how

consistent it was, and how it appeared in so many contexts,

spontaneous memories, evoked memories. Theyjust-- they accepted it. Once they accepted it, it was a life

-changing event in many of their lives. Do you have any favourite stories that you remember of those recurrences,

because it's not-- I have so many. The one I opened the book with 'Life

Cycles', the one I start in the opening pages, is a case of a young

girl named Romy Crees. And Romy was born

to Catholic parents in Iowa. So it's like, it's okay if they

want to reincarnate in India. That's their business. But everybody knows Iowan Catholics

do not reincarnate. But she had spontaneous memories of having been a man, Joe Williams,

in a previous life. She remembers being married. She remembers three children,

having three children, their names. She remembered dying in a motorcycle accident, and she had

a phobia of motorcycles. And long story short, researchers got

to her eventually and brought her to the town where she had remembered

living as Joe Williams. And she was able to remember--

identify the mother of Joe Williams. She insisted that they pick up blue

flowers on the way to the house because she said, Those are the flowers that she

likes, and that turned out to be true. She was able to identify from pictures who the people were in Joe Williams's

life, the players of their life. And she developed a deep emotional bond

to Williams's mother, who was alive. And his wife named Sheila. He had been married. She had been married to-- Joe

had been married to Sheila. They were--did have three children. Sheila and Joe were killed

in a motorcycle accident. So this has-- goes on, and on, and

on. I've read hundreds of these cases. And there's so many of them, yeah. So many. These children remember very

intimate details of family history. They remember-- they know the architecture

inside homes that they've never been in. They can walk around a town that they've never been in and they

know their way around. They remember the personalities

from the previous person's life. And they remember arguments

that they had with neighbours, incidents that came up in-- Like the time

a child, when they were having a birthday party for their child - that a neighbour's

dog bit one of the children in the party. Very, very-- things that are

-- just don't make the public news. Little details.

It's the little details, isn't it? There's one I've read that I loved. I can't remember exactly. But I remember a reincarnated

memory of-- in a Muslim family. And they took the little girl, I think it

was a little girl, into the family. And the women were the veiled,

completely veiled. And she identified from looking at them,

from seeing their body language, without seeing their faces or

anything, she could name them. And that was like, wow,

that's how deep this kind of detail goes. Yeah.

Yeah it's fun to explore those things. And I-- you know,

I recommend to people that you just take a look at some of the evidence,

because it's very-- I find it very affirming. You know, sort of like, it's

difficult to refute that level of detail. And I don't know, you can come up with-- I'm sure a good cynic can

come up with all kinds of-- Well, here's one for the cynics. This is one of Ian Stevenson's cases. They brought this boy back into the life

circumstances of the previous personality. And the wife of the previous personality

said, 'Okay, if you're my husband, where did you put the will? After you

died, we looked all over for the will. We couldn't find it.' The little boy walks over to a floorboard in the kitchen,

picks up a board, reaches down and underneath

the floor and pulls up the will. Isn't that something? How many of those cases do you read before you begin to understand,

this is just happening. It's just part of the rhythm of life.

Totally. It is extraordinary. And also it has-- there's a whole load of documentation about marks on the body,

isn't there? You know people that have marks on the body

that relate to previous events. Or you know-- I don't think we need to go down that route, but it's another whole

area of documentation. That was Ian Stevenson's last work. And if you do want to go down that area,

you can read his two volume, thousand page book

on reincarnation and biology, which he studies 187 cases

with medical documentation. Really rigorous, isn't it?

Rigorous, very, very rigorous. And what we find is that the death wounds, the wounds associated with death

in the previous personality show up as birthmarks or scars

in the subsequent personality. But this is suggesting not only do our -- does our mind influence subsequent

mind, but even our body, our mind's experience in the body can

influence the formation of tissue in our subsequent body. And that of

course just deepens the story. Absolutely.

And that's why I wanted to bring it up, because that's what leads

into the therapeutic work, doesn't it? Because, if you open to this idea then-- I mean I'm just thinking of all the people

out there who have difficulties, maybe in their health,

or maybe in their relationships, or maybe addictions,

or you know whatever we're facing in life, or just things that they've-- complexes

that they find really hard to overcome. And if we understand that those things may have a root in a previous lifetime

and that was something unfinished or incomplete, then it can open up

a whole therapeutic journey for us. And that's what this whole therapeutic

community has evolved, out of this. The past life therapy community, basically, there are any number

of therapists who've said something to the effect of this:

If you put someone into a relaxed, inward-focused state,

a hypnotic state but people have a lot of misunderstandings of what hypnosis--

but just relaxed inward-focused state, and you invite them to go to the source

of the problem that your-- they've come to therapy to address,

about 35-40 percent of them will go back to something in their present life. It'll

come back to something that happened in their childhood or

something in their infancy. But a significant 50-60 percent of people will go back to something that's

rooted in a previous lifetime. And when they consciously remember that previous

lifetime, and they consciously re-appropriate the trauma that they

weren't able to fully internalise and address in that lifetime,

particularly death could-- circumstances surrounding their death,

when they are able to consciously remember and assimilate it into their present

consciousness, then consistently, over and over again,

underlying psychological problems and even physical problems begin to loosen

their grip on us and untie the knots. So \[inaudible\] a greater depth. Because they have these roots deep in the

collective unconscious, you know, and we're going into the collective unconscious to find them

and pull them out. So that's-- Well, let's be a little careful here because

collective unconscious, in a Jungian kind of usage refers

to the unconscious of the entire species. So let's maybe call a soul consciousness, which is the collective unconscious

of the individual through time. I got a good question for you, which is, I have a really dear friend, and he is a

kind of startling intellect. He's in his late seventies now and really,

really intelligent, very spiritual man. And yet he has a difficulty

with reincarnation. And we have wonderful discussions around

it, in the past, and his kind of-- his very sophisticated spiritual

intellect, you know, where it goes is-- and I think others may

come from this direction as well, that's why I'm saying it, is that,

you know, you really want, you know, you want to believe it. Everyone wants to believe

in the continuity of our existence. And yet the great Advaita teachers or whatever, they would talk about the surrender

of the individual ego into the higher-- you know into the-- back

into the ocean of being. And that's something that you have

to undergo in order to attain liberation. And so there is this very strong spiritual kind of-- I think we've referred

to it as 'up and out' kind of cosmology,

where you know there-- we are here to escape this, this cycle,

this samsaric cycle. And that-- you know, so that we

can attain this liberation. And we attain it within this lifetime, in a body, or we may attain it,

you know, afterwards. So that's another whole

kind of interesting area there, isn't it? Yeah, simply because there are cultures

who have believed in reincarnation for thousands of years, and have developed

a certain understanding of it in their culture, doesn't mean

that they've got it right. And I think that reincarnation is one of those ideas that

simply, once we begin to see the evidence, then it begins to deepen a line of enquiry.

Which I-- for me personally, I think is-- I've revised dramatically

the understanding I had of reincarnation borrowed from Eastern traditions,

Eastern cultures. And one of the traditions has to do with this larger question:

Where does reincarnation go? Where is it taking us? What's the endgame of reincarnation? And you're right. All the cultures, all the religions of the Axial age - it

came into existence three to 5000 years ago - all of them teach of a cosmological

journey that's an up-and-out cosmology. So there is a sense

that we're trapped here. This is not as good as spiritual reality. We want to develop either in one lifetime, if it's a Christian salvation,

salvation by grace, you know, or multiple lifetimes to achieve

samsara-- excuse me, acheive moksha. Which is escape from samsara,

escape from the physical world. We achieve some type of enlightenment condition, which is the passport that

allows us to leave and not come back. And all of these traditions are

basically about escape. And that leaves unanswered the fundamental question - what is the purpose

of physical existence in the first place? And now that we have a deeper understanding of how many billions

of years of genius have gone into the manifestation of the physical

world - it's not a very satisfactory conclusion to think that just within five-- we only became conscious of these

deeper dimensions about 5000 years ago. As soon as we become self-conscious

of the level of consciousness which we share with all other

beings and all existence. As soon as we become aware of that and can

live our life from that centre, then the purpose of existence is

to escape the entire physical world? And I don't think that's really true. And it's a little bit rooted in

that kind of slightly self-denial philosophy, isn't it? That, you know,

that also is many thousands of years old. Yeah. I think that basically all the Axial religions got two things

fundamentally wrong. They've got many things right,

but they got two things wrong. They got nature wrong. They don't really have an adequate

theology or understanding of nature. And they got women wrong. And the two are connected because

women are closely connected to nature. And they're patriarchally-oriented

and they're escapist-oriented. And I think it makes-- as

an historian, I understand it. I think about four or 5000 years ago, through various psycho-technologies:

either yoga, or meditation, or psychedelic substances,

we began to have a deeper experience of the mother universe, of this universe

that surrounds the physical universe. Once you have experiential contact with that universe, it is so blissful, it

is so ecstatic-soaked that you cannot help-- and you recognise

that that's where we're from. You cannot help believe

that that's where we belong. This is not where we belong,

that's where we belong. And they develop a theology of return. So the Saviour comes to take us home. The enlightened being comes

to liberate us back into our home. But that still leaves the question,

what is the purpose of creation? And I think what we're beginning

to understand now, as our experience of this mother universe

is deepened over time, and our understanding of the physical

universe has deepened over time, is that we're not here to achieve

escape velocity and leave. We're here to incarnate more, and more, and more of spiritual reality and capacity

inside our physical being, so that we can truly live and create heaven

on Earth, to wake up and stay. And not just to wake up as an individual, but to wake up as an entire

species and stay. Now that-- you can't leave that. I mean we're going to discuss

that more aren't we. We're going to come back to that, yeah. But that's a huge window to open up. It's this-- you know, and you've

touched on a lot of themes there, particularly,

you know, the thing about the feminine, the physical body. You know, that's what I think I interpret partly what you're saying as well is

that those religions didn't really understand the physical body,

as you said, nature. Didn't value it. Because there's vast beauty

in this physicality. And it's perhaps-- what we're exploring

is perhaps it's here to be spiritualised. Perhaps it's here-- you know perhaps that's why we're here,

to bring that ecstatic realisation, deeper, and deeper, and

deeper into the form. Because, you know, if we see that that's our highest purpose,

we no longer want to leave. That's-- then our role is,

through subsequent incarnations, to bring more and more

of that light down into the Earth. And then we're also taking full

responsibility for the body and the Earth. You know which is something

we also haven't done very well. Yeah, absolutely. And if that first-- sounds at first disappointing, where we would say, 'Oh,

no, I want heaven, please. Thank you very much. I don't want, you know, a

transformed body here. Because here is still too difficult.' I think

we may be underestimating how-- but we may be underestimating what is

possible. And just what it would really feel like to live a truly fully

-spiritualised, enlightened existence. And here I think we can look at some

of the God-soaked masters of history. Who are truly living in the

God-soaked condition, or the, you know, a primordial condition

that is radically open to the vast mind of the universe, inside their body,

inside time and space. And what we're seeing from these Mahasiddhas, these great beings, is that

they can do what we would call miracles. Because there is so much spiritual power

concentrated in their presence, that the-- it is as if the laws of

nature operate differently around them. And they're showing us a prototype of what

each of us is in the process of becoming. And, therefore, if we imagine what it

would be like to have an entire species kind of living in that kind

of presence then, what a planet! Yeah and our physics is also pushing

us in that direction, isn't it? To the understandings that we are

entangled with nature, with the universe. And that-- and my old teachings is

based on this notion that in our DNA are contained these sleeping, dormant codes,

these Siddhis, as I call them, 64 Siddhis. And like you were you're

talking about, they're an activation inside us that is waiting for its moment so that we can

enter more fully into the next phase of our evolution, of the magical

universe, the quantum universe. You know, where our thoughts and our

feelings and our sensations are actually travelling kind of outside

our physical body. You know, they're entangled with nature. So nature then responds with us, to us, which perhaps it already does

at a level that we're not aware of. So it's just about opening up those

pathways, you know, those literal pathways in our being, into that next

phase of our evolution. We are already plugged into nature, very,

very deep levels down to the quantum level in the unified field. We're plugged

into our ecosystems and the subtle, intimate feedback. We're plugged into each

other, our minds wash back and forth. We're already there. But when we can become conscious of those

connections, when we can sort of lift off the obstructive shadows

that are carry-overs from other, sadder times,

then that connection becomes -- begins to rise, and it empowers

a conscious participation. And it makes what was

unconscious, conscious. And then existence becomes more enlivened,

I think, and enlivened with the synchronicities

that sort of indicate the broader intelligence that's a-- you know,

that's alive in life around us. Yeah. Yeah I'm sure that you know-- I'd love it if we could bring our conversation also

into sort of-- into people's lives a little bit, so that they can consider

their relationships and-- you know from this perspective, and how that might

change one's attitudes or views towards difficult relationships,

or towards, you know, what's the afflictions that come up in us

and that we have to handle in our everyday life. It really changes

all of that, doesn't it? Because then you look at life and it's actually a process of the opening

of the heart, which the teachers have always said. It's like every relationship,

it's purpose is to show us some grace. And I call this, this Law of Unseen Grace. You know, where every relationship that

shows up is offering us some-- you know particularly the difficult ones, is offering us some

incredible teaching, some virtue that we haven't yet polished. Whether it's forgiveness, or whether it's some, you know, clarity,

or whether it's-- you know, whatever it is, it's just some form of love

that we are here to learn from those relationships, because they have--

they come as part of our teaching-karma. You know, I always see it like, the

ancients called it-- this life a Lila. And I always see these-- a game,

a drama or a theatre. And, it's almost like, before you come in, you're given this little envelope,

and in there, you open up the envelope and in there is like,

'Okay, here's your script and here are-- ' and there's going

to be some things that show up. And these are the things you're going to learn this-- you know, you've

chosen it at some level. And so that changes the way that we

kind of see it-- behave, doesn't it? Yeah.

I think so. I'm sure if you had personal experience of that in your life, in your

emotional life, I mean that's-- Yeah.

And one little-- one more step. It's not simply the envelope

that was given you. But you were given three envelopes and you chose the one

that you felt was most suited for your evolution at this particular

point in history. And so it's your choice

to engage these challenges. And yeah-- and when we engage our life in that way,

it's taking full responsibility for the circumstances

in which we find ourselves in. It allows us to engage the challenges

with more patience, and with more dedication,

and with more of the long term. Because we know we're not-- if this is something that if we don't deal with it

now, it's not going to go away. It's just going to come

back in another form. So let's get it done now. Let's deal with it now. And it also allows you to build on things, because I think

our understanding of reincarnation is being very informed by the therapists

working heroically in past-life therapy. But if you only pay attention to those cases, it can tend to create

an understanding of reincarnation that is tilted towards failures

coming forward that we-- Traumas. Traumas, yeah. But just like the school system around us

has many faults, but most of the kids learn and most

of the kids pass every year. And I think most people rise to the karma,

the challenge of their life. And that means every lifetime we're not simply dealing with leftover

issues from the past. We're building on assets, we're spending assets, and investing in greater

fruition in the future. And so it helps us handle

the challenging circumstances. But it also helps us embrace the positive circumstances of our life,

the hidden talent which comes forward unannounced, the partnership which emerges

that we can feel such a deep kinship with this person, that we can go

forward and do something new with. Yeah. And you kind of triggered a memory of mine

about-- from Sri Aurobindo, you know, who spoke incredibly clearly

with his penetrating mind about the complexity of karma,

and how we-- you know, because we probably need to sort of probably discuss

karma a little bit, and how we misunderstand it so easily

by trying to oversimplify it. And, actually, when you look at the universe with all its

multiple dimensions and the quantum field, and there's these force fields

operating at different levels. But there's this karmic force that's equalising and balancing, or

that has a tendency towards balance, we could say, and it's-- and allowing us

to go through this educational process. But everything at different levels is influenced by these strands

of the karmic force. And that karmic force seems to have-- it's like the idea I said about unseen grace,

if you are able to fully embrace it in your life, then you get a grace

through going-- through unwrapping it. But you've got to kind of have the courage face it fully, and really take it

in and let it-- you know, whatever the suffering is,

transform it, transmute it. So it doesn't-- transmutation of karma play a huge part in this

reincarnative theology. If we just look around us. It's the web of cause and effect. Everything is cause and effect. We live in a continuous web of cause and effect. The air we breathe,

the weather patterns, our biology, what we ate, the purity of what we ate,

everything is this flow of cause and effect, the universe, the movement

of the planets, the solar system. We live in a continuous web of cause and effect. And

here we're simply focusing on that portion of the web of cause and effect,

which influences the human-- the development of the soul,

influences our human psychophysical development, which is a subset

of this much larger cause and effect. And, in that context, I think we've had a tendency, I think, to

narrow our discussion of Karma. Usually, many of the teachers will talk about karma, and they're only talking

about that portion of the karma, which immediately impinges upon our

spiritual maturity. Where they were making progress, becoming a more

spiritually mature person. But a lot of karma, probably the bulk of

karma, is just amoral cause and effect. You have a habit, you practise something, it becomes a skill, that skill

carries over into another life. You have an automobile accident,

you develop a trauma of a particular circumstance, that carries

over into another life. It's not necessarily

about your spiritual development. It's just cause and effect. Yeah, circumstantial.

Yeah. And so when-- as you open up to the conditioning,

that's kind of etching itself in your life, and you lift it out,

engage it, lift it out. Then that-- the well-spring

of your life becomes freer. It becomes clearer. And you're not stepping out of the web of cause and effect,

but you're stepping into a greater freedom within the web-work of cause

and effect that surrounds you. You have greater capacity to make

increasingly free choices. Greater capacity to choose. Ask yourself, 'Well, what do I want? What would I like to have?'

Instead of a compulsion of, you know, grabbing. You know, it's tempting, isn't it? For some people to kind of say,

'Well, karma and reincarnation,' then there's this sort of like, 'Well,

that person over there was born disabled. Does that mean they've done something

terrible in their last life?' And there's that whole

real sort of oversimplification-- Over, yeah.

Of a very complex kind of arena where -- you know, we don't-- unless you can

plug right into the soul-quality inside that person, inside that being,

you don't really know what-- you know, they could be that hidden

Saint that has deliberately taken on that incredibly challenging role,

to polish one particular virtue, you know, or skill, over the period of one lifetime. And equally I guess, like,

very short incarnations. That's-- I don't think you and I talked

about those, but I'd love to hear what you -- you know, like a child that comes

in for a very short time and then leaves. That also has implications for

the healing of the whole, doesn't it? Because why does a child come in for a short time,

or a baby is born very-- for a very short period of time and then

there's-- leaves this grief behind it. But then there's this feeling that it's

also still part of your life. Yeah. Let's explore that, I mean we haven't-- we

can go and-- We haven't talked about that, yeah. You know it's a-- we can recognise

the principle of cause and effect. We can recognise the principle

of karma-vipaka, cause and effect. But then we can get-- so many

teachers I think sometimes get -- or all of us, we think we

can determine cause and effect. We think we can understand it when really we're just touching the wrapping

on the package. We're just really touching the surface,

and the safest position I think really is recognise that we're looking

at a deep, deep mystery here. And you're-- it would be foolish to try to judge anybody's karma that's

just a-- that's a wasted exercise. Better to stick with the karma that you

can penetrate within your own life. And you're right, because we don't know,

we really don't know what's happening when we see cause and effect

operating around us. When you-- I would tell my students, when you see great suffering,

you're either seeing a sinner or a Saint. And you can never know which it is,

so best not to make any judgments at all. And I think there are many hidden Saints, many more hidden Saints who are

taking on a lot of cause and effect, either from their own larger soul stream,

or from even a collective soul stream. So they're actually focusing in their body, in their psyche,

what we might call negative karma, negative cause and effect,

for the uplift of the whole. And that type of generosity

and compassion, we see it around us all the time in good parents,

and good mothers, and good fathers. They would be-- do anything

for their children. And I think souls

at that deeper level do that too. So we can't judge. We really just

couldn't judge, it's a waste of effort. No. I read this book. I think I told you about this book, and anyone-- it's a recommendation called

'Sand Talk', and it's by an Aboriginal from Australia, or part

-Aboriginal, and really intelligent man. And he tells the story of when he went to talk to one of the elders about,

you know, the problems of, you know, the indigenous people,

particularly the men who had kind of just got-- gone down the role

of alcoholic, the way of alcoholism. And were eating really terrible food, and, like, were overweight and obese,

and these terrible problems. And he was, like, really concerned about them, and the old elder just said,

'Yeah, they're the warriors. You know, they are taking on the karmic,

you know they are warrior spirits in our tribe, in our lineage. And they're holding

this kind of negativity in their bodies. And one day they will become-- they will move

from warrior to healer. And that's the path. That's the kind of evolutionary pathway.' But it was a beautiful,

it really, like, it really stuck with this young man as he was

exploring like, 'Wow,' that's a really kind of powerful, empowering

way to see someone dealing with, like, a cultural problem. You know or a societal,

you know, difficulty that's more collective,

you know, that we see a lot. You know, collective

karma is a-- you know, we're touching on here as well. Yeah, it's a very, very deep-- those deep

currents that run underneath, that requires us to open to a much deeper,

expanded spiritual story. And because we often think of reincarnation

and karma in a very individualistic, atomistic fashion where we're-- you know,

the individual soul is evolving themselves over the skilful use of choice

in the context of karma. And if we start to sink into a larger

understanding, a deeper understanding, then we recognise that each individual

is a fractal point within a unified field. And that there's a-- these deep currents

that are running within the unconscious of humanity, or the

soul-field of humanity, and that we are all players

on a larger evolutionary dynamic. Then it just opens up a deeper

understanding of what's taking place here. And I know that we've sort of tagged this for one of our topics for our

second discussion, but it's-- yeah. Well we'll plant the seed now. When you go into that kind of world view,

the perfection of the choreography of what you're explaining is just

mind blowing, isn't it? It's mind blowing in terms

of the interconnectivity of soul groups, and these fractals,

and these patternings of humans. And this is why one of the great insights

that I got from your uni-- 'Mind of the Universe' book,

because you describe this really well. It's a paradox, I think. And maybe it's one of the last things we can just discuss here today because it's

so important, I find, and it's the paradox of being an individual soul and yet

being everything at the same time. So how does that paradox-- how

do we-- how does that hold up? You described it beautifully

in your book as, I think you said, 'the soul was open on all sides'. I think that was the expression you used,

which I really liked, open on all sides. It's so, like, part of the ocean

and yet still a focalised drop. 'Time and awareness', also, you named it. Yeah it seems common-sensical that you can't be both apart

and the whole at the same time. Those are mutual, exclusive categories. And even, you know, great spiritual

teachers - the Vedantic tradition in Hinduism and other spiritual systems

have said, 'The goal of life is to abandon your individuality

- dissolve that and allow yourself to be absorbed into the totality

and know the bliss of absorption.' So that means all the individual

capacity which we are developing over all these incarnations in this

view ends in extinction. And it's kind of wasted. And I think it's wasted. And I think that's-- it's

an inadequate world view. And what has emerged in my spiritual path

and in my psychedelic path is a very different kind of world view,

that I think we share. And that is that we are moving into higher and higher,

more sophisticated forms of individuality. That individuality is one

of the great gift of creation. It's something that the divine

wants to encourage in its creation. And-- but at early stages of individuality, we experience our individuality cut off

from the larger texture of surrounds. So it's us against them,

or us and the whole. But when individuality matures into a richer expression,

into what I would call the birth of the diamond soul,

then there is both a sense of being a specific defined individuality emerging

out of the specific historical lineage. And yet at the same time, profoundly open

to the larger patterns of existence, open to each other and compassionate

heart, open to other human beings with whom we have such deep

histories with, and open to-- in a sense that the intelligence

of the universe, open to the perceptions and the influence

of ideas that flow into us. And this communion with the universe. Which-- and I actually believe

that you have to have developed a very, very strong individuality to withstand

the intensity of the communion that's available to us when we enter into

communion with the one, with the whole. It is as if, if we didn't-- if we weren't really, really diamond hard and focused and clear,

when we encountered the love of the universe for us,

it would just shatter us. We have to be strong in order to actually participate in the deeper

levels of communion. And I think you know that-- that's such

an empowering vision, so empowering. And it's also a-- you know, I think it opens this

question of our notion of enlightenment, our notion of divinity,

we have to kind of go on expanding that, because it's just

a notion that we've inherited. And even though it's been useful to get us to where we are,

we have to just go on expanding it. And, for me, what

is kind of missing more in the current, you know, modalities is creativity. That whole idea of it coming to an end and then going out into the wonderful

absorption of the whole, you know, by maintaining the individuality at the same time, what you are maintaining

is creativity, creativity itself. Because then you are like a shard

of the divine creative essence. And it's like you said in your book,

'Go out and create my children.' You know, and if there were

a divinity, let's just say, and it wanted to have children, then the thing it would want for its

children is to be free, right? And to go out and create,

and to become gods within God. That's the vision I hold, that we become

creator gods within the wider God. Yes. Lovely expression!

You know, small 'g' in a big 'G'. Gods within God, yeah. The creative spark

within the fire of creation. Yes. I agree with that.

I share that. And it changes everything. It changes how we greet the children who are born into our families, because

we know that they're not coming from us. They're coming to us. It changes how we see old people and how

we see little people, because young people are not necessarily

young in terms of their soul-age. Old people are not necessarily

old in terms of their soul-age. It just opens up a much larger tapestry, and it gives us

permission to recognise the deep aspirations that we have towards

greatness, towards great creativity, towards the great love,

towards great spiritual fulfilment. Things that we may or may not finish

and get through in this lifetime. But we can move toward them. It's much more, in some respect, sophisticated spirituality,

isn't it? It's more nuanced. It requires a subtler

kind of understanding intellectually - I would say intellectually but through a

subtler intelligence to understand it. It's not this sort of, you know,

here's a law of karma. It governs everything. You know, bang! It's not that simple. It's like Aurobindo says, 'There are layers and layers

of understanding and subtlety and nuance.' It's like a-- I'm a lover of tea,

you know, fine tea. And when you find something like that, and you can be anything, you can be

a chess player, and you find the subtlest nuances in the thing you're

really understanding. The layers, and layers, and layers

as you become more attuned to it. And I think that's what we are. We are becoming more, and more tuned, the more evolved that individual soul-essence

becomes. Then the more subtle we can-- the more we can

understand, you know, these nuances. And then we're kind of-- I don't know

-- that we're really inspired by the-- empowered, as well,

by the creative current. I mean, maybe we can leave this to the next one,

but people always talk about past lives. And my part of my teaching is like,

I'm interested in future-lives as well. And because when you expand your sense of time broadly enough, you know, really,

like, really don't hold back anything. You don't need to just look backwards. You can also remember forwards, because there's this feeling of memory

has to go back. But memory, also, for me,

is like, it travels forwards. And that's what we call revelation. So revelations can come backwards and

forwards through time into this essence. And this essence can be hugely expanded by those revelations,

and more focused than ever in the present, you know,

in the beauty of the present moment. So, yeah, I think that's

the thought I'd like to end on. But is there any, like-- do you

want to close this off? That's a really good thought

and a good spot to end on. To me, the principle of accumulation is one of the fundamental principles I bring

to understanding what's happening in creation,

that the universe is accumulating. It's learning. It's a self-learning system. And so we are constantly learning. We can't help but learn. Even if we do a mediocre job in our lifetime, we're still

learning in that lifetime. And if we do a better job, we're learning. And as we learn, we activate. In one sense, I think we are learning

to be geniuses in every area of life. A genius at chess, a genius at relationships, a genius

in all the different areas of life. And it's as if each lifetime is a petal

in a flower, the soul is the flower. And their-- if you just-- I meditate sometimes on a flower

and imagine each hundred-year-lifetime is a pistil, and a stamen,

and a petal in this magnificent flower. And that's, you know-- to

be a genius at life, to really to be completely unfolded, and

taking advantage of the opportunity that we've been given to grow

and become more than we've been. And, again,

so many-- even though many cultures have understood reincarnation, I

don't think they've grasped it fully. They haven't really seen the

full potential of the concept. They've really seen it within an early

limitation of it. And on the future,

we're going to talk about time more, I know, as we go on, but let me

just leave with the thought that Robert Monroe, the great out-of-body

researcher and the founder of the Monroe Institute

of Applied Sciences, his book 'Far Journeys' / 'Ultimate

Journey', he said he reached a point in his explorations out-of-body,

where he discovered he realised that you don't necessarily have to incarnate

in the next century. That incarnation isn't

necessarily historically linear. You could have former lives that were

actually lived in future time. So that, isn't that-- that just,

like, 'Oh man,' that really-- I'm going to have to unpick

that one a little bit. Yeah, that really challenges things. In addition to intuiting the future which is not yet,

and bringing the not yet into the now, I wonder sometimes whether some of us have sampled that future time, and are

inculcating the awareness in the now. That's what I would call a current

of involution as opposed to evolution. There is a spiritual force coming down, and there is

an evolution-- evolving force going up, if you want to do it up and down,

but, you know, it's like a funnel. Yeah,

Sri Aurobindo. I love you quoting Sri Aurobindo because he's one of my heroes

too, and he says all that clearly. And I agree.

Yeah. Great.

Well, what a wonderful beginning Chris. Thank you so much.

Yeah, I look forward to where we go next. Yeah, me too, yeah. Take care. Take care Richard.

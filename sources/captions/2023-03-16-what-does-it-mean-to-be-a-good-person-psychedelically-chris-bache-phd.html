said this uh you've already answered this somehow but given Where We Are from the perspective of the deep psychedelic work that you've done you know what does it mean to be a good person right now what is it what does it mean to be um how what does it take you know yeah man that's a large question foreign ways to answer that question pop into my mind and all of them are wrong so I'm kind of sifting through layers [Applause] yeah in some of my deepest experiences there are moments there are times when and even after a session but under the influence of the learning of a session when something just Falls away something opens and I I experience the world truly us living and breathing as one I feel like my feet are rooted in the Earth the way a tree is rooted in the earth I look down at the grass and I Feel Complete continuity of being between everything around me and my own being I feel it's breathing the same air I feel us all different species sharing the same moment in time I feel the pulse of the universe in its utter simplicity not paying attention to any of our divisions of species or moods or incarnations or anything like that the entire universe just being itself and I am part of that in grateful it's not even communion because communion implies a subtle Duality and this is when all of that falls away and a great transparency of being opens from within that position I experience an opening of my mind kind of a delicious sense of presence it gives me an intimacy with grass and then at a deeper level I experienced an opening of my heart in which the idea of harming anyone is the farthest thing from my mind and the idea of helping everyone is the most natural thing in the world it's it's not being good it just it's it's being alive within this reality of Oneness so to me goodness is simply an approximation or it's a it's a it's a compass needle that points in the direction of this fundamental truth of Oneness and the truth of Oneness is all these derivatives that flow from it in circumstances but at Essence it's very very simple and I think compassion goodness in that way fairness Justice for all aspects of Oneness are all kind of fractal manifestations of Oneness so what does it take to be a good person today I think it takes a willingness a commitment to serving a collective good to serving a good that's not private it opens up to Future Generations that opens up to people who are unlike me and species who are unlike me just an honest confrontation with what is in order to bring about a better life for other beings I know this is very simple um but to me goodness is is is simple it is is that simple it gets complicated in the enacting of it but in the at its core it it's an action that comes out of Oneness and if it's not coming out of a deep grounding in Oneness then maybe there's something not to trust in it Because deep goodness comes out of Oneness I think now I don't know if this really addresses the depth out of which your question is coming because I I understand the true the true angst not angst but the true kind of quandary from which that question comes but the deepest answer I have in response to it I'm afraid is just a mystical experience a mystical experience of Oneness in which that context goodness just becomes an insignificant component to spontaneous component just like the way you react when you see something beautiful it's just it's a rising it comes up inside of you goodness is simply an arising that comes up inside of you when you're in the condition of Oneness I have a I have a maybe a more sort of serious response and have a more joking response and a more serious response is is something along the lines of um like what what does it what does it look like to [Music] um what does the dance look like you said it becomes difficult in the enactment you know um what does the dance look like between okay having that experience because I've had that experience and I can tell you fully 100 honestly that anywhere from ten percent of the time to 99 of the time I'm not there at all there's no sense of it whatsoever in my experience you know and I I am and I'm not in the ground of that as I'm as I'm as I'm showing up in the world and I'm wondering yeah you know in the same way that also the playful response was so we all should all take 500 mics of LSD right um but no no in the what does it look like to have had that experience because the way that you speak about it and I think naturally it makes sense like when you're there goodness just flows from you right it is the most organic and natural expression of being in the world is when you're coming from that place and yet having a deep and profound experience doesn't make you a deep and profound person experiencing Oneness doesn't mean that you now walk through the world inspired and Infused in all your actions you know Oneness just streams from your fingertips and every interaction is a blessing with the world from the depth of the Oneness that I have embodied simply by taking enough mushrooms to touch at once so yeah what does it look like then I mean maybe this is a question around integration yeah you know what does it mean to remember that and what does it mean to um to catch ourselves in forgetting yeah Ah that's that is uh you know we we go up on the mountain we see some things we may be given some blessings and then we come down and then we have to go to work on Monday morning and for that's over and over again it means a matter of constantly uh engaging being aware of how you're engaging checking yourself recommitting yourself to doing a better job over and over and over again for me much of it was in my work as a teacher you know constantly always enjoying it always loving to be with the students always wanting to do it better but constantly catching myself making assumptions making false inferences not doing a good enough job being a little tired letting my students down on a particular day coming back and trying to do better coming do better the next day the better the next week better the next semester over and over again trying to live up to the things that we know to be true integration is a is a strange term I'm not sure I'm glad that the Psychedelic Community is paying more attention to integration because it's really really critical but and there are dimensions and aspects of integration and the word integrate carries us a certain distances and doesn't carry us so far but it's it's hard to live our Visions it's hard to live the truth of what we've seen it because it commits you to constantly being aware if you take the time to remember to pay attention to yourself how bad a job we're doing living those truths but that's just that's the nature of the Beast though uh we just it's constantly I mean if we are if we live around people who are really good people who really have a deeper natural instinct for goodness and kindness and generosity than we have then it makes it easier to to sort of face our own shortcomings because we have someone that we can look at and say ah that person's doing this better than I do so this gives me a measuring stick I can do better I'll I'll do it better tomorrow I'll keep working on it and that's why you know in the Buddhist tradition spiritual friends people who are also have committed themselves to Awakening that's really one of the great uh Sangha Community is one of the great pillars of progress so yeah you're right it's wonderful to have the experience but we don't walk around in that state but we practice and practice and practice and then maybe 10 years later we were in a little bit more 10 years later maybe we're in it a little bit more but uh practice and practice and practice and if we ever think that we're really there then all we have to do is ask our young children and they'll remind us that we're not really there as far along as we think we are our our kids will set us straight there or perhaps or perhaps we could I think it was a baba ramdas said if you ever think you're spiritually awakened go spend a week at your parents or something like that someone who's the other way around um yes yes [Music] [Music] foreign</p></body></html>

      <p>hi everybody welcome lovely to see you um wherever you are in the world it's a beautiful evening um here in devon england so thank you so much for joining us tonight you could be out in the sunshine but it's uh lovely to see you and welcome to anyone who is watching on the recording and i think there will be quite a few of those um so we are um talking about contemporary animism um tonight this is a talk in our contemporary animism programme um we are really delighted to uh show you an interview that we did some time ago with a chap called chris batch um colin is going to introduce him a bit more in depth but just to say that he took part in our contemporary animism confluence back in february and we just thought that what he had to say was just so um hopeful at a moment when we as a species as a community of species are looking at a fairly dark night of the soul with all the climate change news and and social crises and it just seems that that chris's vision um is just one of hope and um we really hope you'll enjoy it what we're going to do tonight is basically play the interview it's quite heady i'll just warn you uh there's a lot of talking um and it and it goes for about 50 minutes and what we'd really like to do is for you to watch it to go in and out of it as you like and uh then to stay with us for 10-15 minutes afterwards if you're interested to and just share some of your feelings the the stuff that might have come up for you as you are watching it um just to see whether you yes you you like it whether you're excited as us or um whether it's not for you so without further ado colin can i can i ask you to introduce chris also just to just to give you the logistics of chris he is a professor of theology um retired uh from one of the american universities and he's the author of um several books all of which are wonderful the first one is about reincarnation the second one is called dark knight early dawn which was fantastic and his most recent one and the one that he will be talking about tonight um describes his research method um which he'll tell you more about um called lsd in the mind of the universe colin over to you thanks rachel good evening everyone um yeah i mean i i don't almost know where to start um because well let me start by saying this it was about i think a year ago a little more relatively recently i stumbled upon the title dark knight early dawn and i was particularly struck by the subtitle which is steps towards a new ecology of mind and and that for me just rang massively and i simply had to get ahold of this book and read it just because of that because because that's just such a huge passion of mine in the sense that i think that what we are in search of in these times and amid the very particular um conundrums and transformations and um all that we're up against in in both crisis and and other terms as a human collective what we're faced with is a kind of a a re a redo of what we conceive of as our relationship with existence with life with the rest of the natural world and so on so the idea of a new ecology of mine really appealed to me and i must say i wasn't disappointed by the book um it really i think it's a it's a seminal piece to be very honest i think you know he was saying some really profound things um and things which are very close to my heart as well in terms of finding ways into in an experiential way reinvigorating much of what we've lost um over over the um during the process of kind of secularization industrialization globalization and so on um finding a way of of of re-entering re-accessing that and revivifying it bring it bringing it back into our uh into into being part of our kind of search for what being human means now and here forward um you know and i was you know for me uh there are lots of ways of of kind of entering into this but of course the primary way of exploring into it is to is to kind of delve deeply into what it means to be human and part of the problem we sit with presently is that we're so drastically uh distracted in the world that we've created for ourselves presently and i mean by that the uh primarily the industrialized world we're we're so distracted you know by our outer concerns that our inner environments or what we broadly refer to as our inner environment and what i would call our our pre-industrial ancestry which of course is dynamically within us but has somehow fallen beneath the level of our everyday interactive awareness um you know where that that unfortunately as we question this this conundrum of how we move forward as a species how we re uh negotiate our relationship with the next the rest of the natural world how we confront um or at least engage with some of the more dramatic crises that we face as a humanity now um you know we need to we need to find ways of bringing back what i conceive of is that as that part of us that has been sequestered off um that pre-industrial aspect of who we are um there which has kind of been labeled regressive and you know primitive and all sorts of names that we use in a sense to sublimate it and trivialize it and depreciate it and throw it out of the um the kind of uh i don't quite know what to call it but the engagement with where we're at um and so you know when i came across chris's work and and i've i've read some of his subsequent work and of course before that i was a a great follower of stan groff's work um out of which a lot of chris's work comes um you know i i i just think that this is an incredibly important way of delving into uh in a radical way i also say i'm you know i'm very deeply of the belief that our engagement right now with the state that we find ourselves in as a humanity requires a radical potent engagement you know we can't really afford to uh dabble around on the edges of things so if we're going to look at finding contemporized forms of our pre-industrial ancestry if we're going to look at experiential exploration deep delving into who we are what we are and our broken relationships with the natural world there has to be a radicalness to this because it's urgent it's desperate in fact um and and so you know with groff's work and with with chris's writing subsequently and his experimentation and exploration his deep and profound in my opinion courage in in the way he's gone in um i i think this is just you know it's such a profound part of what we are certainly what i'm passionate about in this time uh in terms of the kind of work that we're doing as rachel said earlier in in our contemporary animism program and trying to rally you know interest in an experiential uh exploration of what reanimating ourselves might mean might look like um and i just think that you know i i think that this is what you're going to see tonight in this talk is the absolute tip of a a profound iceberg if we could put it that way you know as he it's well worth reading his work it's well worth looking at groff's work as well it's very much in my opinion a critical part of the kind of exploration that i think is most needed at this time pardon my bias on this but i really do believe this so um that having been said i'm going to pass back to rachel um and i'll be very interested to hear some of your reflections at the end thank you fantastic thank you colin so we'll dive straight in um i have just asked him so we've just started and i have asked him um just to tell us about his research method and how he how he came to the vision that um he will then tell you about later on in the interview um and how that fits into kind of the animist world that we're exploring so it starts in the middle of sentence is his first sentence so you've only missed about two or three words um but yes that's where we'll start so i'm going to hand over to you now gabby and enjoy um i find him very mind-blowing um but see what you think gabby go thank you we're not getting any sound gabby i know this works because we checked it earlier so sorry what's the what's the problem rachel we're not getting any sound on it is anybody getting any sound on it nope [Music] oh after all after the introduction that's going to be uh disappointing if you can't hear him any insights here because i'm not exactly sure what's going on you want to give it another john press go again and we'll share in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness it's fused with mind and soul and of course now we know how vast the physical universe is and the question becomes how large is the mind of the universe how deep is it and so i was just out of graduate school in 1978 in my finishing philosophy of religion and i met the work of stanislav grogg whom many of you know one of the foremost thinkers in the transpersonal psychology community in the psychedelic community and i read his book realms of the human unconscious and my life pivoted with that book because i immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy but it would he was offering a method to actually safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness wherein lay the answers to the philosophical questions that i was carrying coming out of a training in religious studies so in 1979 i began what became a 20-year journey working with lsd and it was 1979 lsd is what stan had done his research with and that's what i chose to continue with if i were doing it today i would have a more diversified cocktail of ayahuasca civil side but more but i worked with lsd and i chose to work with very high doses for reasons that are too complicated to go into now but that had a profound impact on the work because it not only changed how deep the wind work the work went but it changed how wide it went the field of consciousness that i took in these transformational exercises expanded with the power of the state of consciousness that i was entering to enter into these exercises so basically i did this work in standard graffian protocol totally isolated from the world with the sitter trained clinical psychologists that are i did it at home in a controlled environment totally internally focused not in any with any contact with the outside world amplifying the states of awareness with carefully selected music designed to empower the states of consciousness in which you basically just shatter your mind in essentially working at these levels you just shatter your mind and your mind dissolves out into subtler and subtler forms or aspects of reality and it became a systematic exploration of what i think of as the mind of the universe i hesitate to call the divine though sometimes i do it's just because the divine has so many culturally infused qualities in history that i'd rather avoid so i think of it as the mind of the universe and i did this work for 20 years i always keeping very careful records and whatnot and then i i digested those experiences for another 20 years because this is these are not immediately transparent experiences they're very complex and interwoven and they involved many levels of reality being orchestrated in the same kind of titles that surges of these states there was a systematic instruction i found that one session more or less started where the other session stopped when you work in this systematic fashion there was progressive deepening and deepening and deepening and so it just took years for me to understand what the universe was showing me and where it was taking me and i was being shown things i mean i always had a sense of a systematic encounter with an intelligence that was orchestrating my experience in dialogue with me not taking any form never taking any any deity form or any archetypal form but always when pressed dissolving into deeper and deeper layers of infinity uh anyway so that is cumulatively the story that i'm telling in lsd in the mind of the universe and would you say chris that this is an objective reality that if anybody that did a similar method i mean i think i think what you did was incredibly brave but would would everybody kind of reach this unfolding that you did using that method or is that not possible to say i think i think it is possible to say i think stan groff's work allows us to say it and where he's dealing with integrating the experiences of thousands of people and i'm only talking integrating my experiences but my experiences fit comfortably within the larger matrix that growth is work is explored and it's a complicated answer because on the one hand i want to say yes and on the other hand i have to qualify that immediately because when you begin this work these substances only amplify consciousness they don't give you an experience they don't take you a particular place they amplify your mind and because each of us has a different life story then the mind which is amplified is different and we therefore when an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe what comes forward will be in the beginning somewhat unique and will reflect our individual history and why these substances are very helpful for healing they evoke our unconscious and therefore they evoke our problems and as an individual experience but if you keep going farther if you press to the limits of of your time space identity if you press to the limits of what your individual history can hold and go through this transformation we call ego death then you begin to open into spiritual reality farther removed from your own personal history and that's when the experiences begin to overlap that's when they begin to converge now my understanding is that spiritual reality is not simply something you enter and pluck fruit from like plucking an apple from a tree it's interactive it's always interactive so there's a participatory quality to our experiences so the mind that we bring to the encounter acts as a seed catalyst that crystallizes a certain set of experiences from the infinite potential of the mind of the universe and then as we internalize those experiences and are purified by those experiences it changes the seed mind and then we it catalyzes an even deeper level of secrets from the universe so it's a both end situation it's participatory but once you understand the cycle of participation then i think the universe that we discover is coherent and consistent my universe is the same universe that is discovered by contemplative monks the mystical traditions the near-death episode traditions there are degrees of depth and then we have to be careful because you can reach a point where you think oh this is what the reality is and it turns out well no this is what reality is at this level of reality but you can pop that and go into a deeper level of reality things change a bit one thing that i find really exciting about your work is that we talk about practices you know that finding the right practices to find the cracks kind of in ourselves to get back to a much more poorest expanded way of being and yet these practices take repetition and tenaciousness and everything and and you have used a different method here you've used what what one might kind of think of as a fast track to some of these experiences i mean it's a very difficult method and i'm sure not one that you would kind of recommend to a lot of people but that that feels for me where the excitement of your work is as you first tracked a lot of slower practices and possibly got to the edge of the map that a lot of these con templative practices have booked to um i feel as though you've managed to go further than than much that i've seen before on kind of what what the underlying nature of reality is would you say that's true it is a fast track except uh it's a fast track that doesn't allow any bypassing so the fact that it's a fast track means it's a much more intensely concentrated track so purification which in the conventional spiritual path would be drawn out over years can take place within days and as any woman who's given birth knows a short labor is not necessarily an easy year labor it's just much much more intense and this is true for this type of practice too the purifications that one goes through in order to acclimate to these subtler and cleaner and clearer states of reality those purifications and detoxifications are extremely intense i mean they send you in convulsions across the floor and throwing up constantly coming and going and they require a systematic purification of your lifestyle just as any traditional spiritual practice does and i want to emphasize that the states of consciousness that i touched for hours at a time we usually only learn about these realities from the work of contemplative mystics who have a certain sense that they abide in these realities and i emphasize that this is a practice not of abiding it's a temporary access it's only temporary immersion in these states and i don't want to confuse temporary immersion from abiding immersion all honor to the great ones who abide in these realities you know this is different this is temporary access very very intense purification but you don't come away with permanent access embedded in your nature to these realities what you come away with are seeds of transcendence or seed experiences which you then have to nurture within your your daily spiritual practice you have to nurture them within your embodied physical existence and i also want to mention that these practices in the earlier times in history have tended to be associated with the dissociative spirituality so the goal was to get up into transcendence and get away from earth you know so these are the up and out cosmologies of the last five sexual age religions in the last five thousand years the cosmology that emerged in my work is very different it wasn't about getting transcendence it was transcendence in service of incarnation transcendence and service of deeper integration it was about opening up and letting in as much of the universe as possible and then going through the transformations that would allow this energy to live in the historical body and giving me at one point insights into where the evolutionary intelligence was taking the human family as a whole i began this work thinking in terms of a personal model of transformation but things happen that just shattered that model and i began to understand that i was had been drawn into a collective transformation and that my my so-called individual work was part of a collective process which then naturally yielded some insights into our collective family human family evolutionary trajectory fantastic and i want to ask you about that in great depths in a minute because for me that's kind of the exciting um thing that you discovered if you like but first of all i'd love to ask you about the aliveness and intelligence in the universe then um we are talking about um the aliveness and intelligence in everything around us you know and humans being just one load of that that just kind of as is everything um an animate world an animated universe i just wondered if you could summarize your um understandings of the aliveness in the universe and how layered that is and how deep that goes how big it is um yes what did you what did you mean oh you're asking a lot because you know the universe is so vast and the mind of the universe has so many layers to it and those layers are of course all complexly intertwined and it's all alive and it's all intelligent and it's it's everywhere we dig into the universe of course we discover aliveness and intelligence we're finding that we can't dig in anywhere and not encounter this intelligence this living intelligence so when you dig into the mind of the universe you find layers of intelligence operating there there are layers of entire intelligence operating in the biosphere operating in the incarnational rhythms of a planet i i began to experience at one point for example reincarnation the i had gone into i'm sorry to cut so many corners here but there's no way to do it except jump into it go into states of consciousness in which time was radically dilated not eternity not timelessness but radical dilations of time and dilations of of personal boundaries so dissolving into my human family becoming the human family and from that perspective experiencing reincarnation the pulse of reincarnation taking place all of us together as a single organism incarnate generation by generation and i experienced whole lifetimes incarnating in generations living their lives dying and returning into the spiritual reality and there was an intelligence to this entire process so that all of our what i had previously thought of as individual karma individual challenging individual transformation all of our individual karma was part of a vast network of exquisitely tuned collective karma and our and history was expressing the rhythms of collective transformation through the medium of our individual transformation just one example and then going deeper beginning to experience the pulse of the entire universe as a single living organism and when you when you dissolve it into that level of oneness you know the the buddhists have a word for it they talk about nirvana blown out itself is blown out their emptiness of self when you experience the world as one in any scale then you experience that there are no permanent boundaries between yourself and the world so literally there is no private self and so the self kind of pops and life runs through you you run through life and the whole of life reads as one it breathes together as platinum said so everywhere you touch it the world is intelligent at the very end of my journey after in the 70th session out of 73 i did 73 sessions in the 70th session i was taken deep deep deep into what i call deep time farther into time than i had ever been taken before and given a series of visions and one of those visions had to do with experiencing in some way from my perspective in my history the large story of what was happening in the universe and i experienced reincarnation i was experiencing the same deep pattern and i experienced stars of light shooting out of time and space shooting into the universe and i i understood that these were what i call diamond souls these were the fruition of a reincarnation process creating a diamond pure a soul that could explore the spiritual world in dimensions previously unavailable to it but time and space was creating diamond souls over vast periods of time so layers and layers and layers of intelligence operating at different levels so when i read your book chris i mean it's literally mind-blowing i mean it it's kind of it feels as though it's science fiction or it's in the realms of science fiction and yet for me there was nothing in there that didn't sound right you know it just kind of has that feeling ah yes i understand this and it feels right to me um and i'd love to talk to you about the evolutionary process you touched on it a bit there but let's go into that in more detail but first of all reincarnation because that is something that obviously we don't all um feel is true but it you you did earlier work on the subject of reincarnation and just before we go on to the evolutionary um story that you've seen could you talk about a little bit about reincarnation and your work on it and why you believe that that is what's happening well i did i wrote my first book on reincarnation because i thought it was such an essential principle because our philosophical roads divide if you think we only are on earth one time but we're on earth multiple times those need to different visions of reality and today i think we have overwhelming empirical evidence that reincarnation is simply true it's a fact of life i think ian stevenson at the university of virginia and his study of young children around the world who have spontaneous memories over their most immediate life he's just documented hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these children uh and his his research has been challenged but it's still it's holding up and i think he is the charles darwin of reincarnation studies and then we have past live therapies people coming in highly qualified people healing using past life access to past life memories to heal present life traumas this to me is just an empirical fact of life so after living it takes a long time to sort of live in a reincarnation universe to understand the implications of the fact that there's this pulse of life and that all of us have been here multiple times and all of us have deeper histories with place with people with projects and that we're always starting something and we're continuing something in one lifetime and we're doing something that's going to be continued in another lifetime that this overlapping complexity so that i don't see little children as little anymore i don't see old people as old anymore sometimes little children are deeply old and soul and old people are sometimes very young and soul and it sucks you you just tune to a different level now i had that in the early stages of my psychedelic work and in the early stages of my psychedelic work i was taken into some of the nuts and bolts of reincarnation and karma and then that became kind of ground one as i began to be taken into the human family and to experience the human family evolving and growing through reincarnation this to me reincarnation is simply the higher octave of evolution it's the cutting edge of evolution in our particular species where evolution was trying to change whole species reincarnation is evolving individuals within certain species and i don't think just human species i think somewhere lower down the line reincarnation begins to turn in gestate um and then the question becomes well where is reincarnation taking us if we are reincarnating so many times where are we going what's what's all project of it what's the purpose of it and to determine to answer the question what's the purpose of a reincarnating species is complicated because once you understand that every human being on the planet is reincarnating with a purpose its specific purpose then you realize the full breadth of the living experience of a human being the breadth of what's being learned that what humanity is learning is just enormous and when we try to say well this is the purpose of life we have a tendency to sort of take a purpose that we can identify with and maybe over generalize it to encompass all purposes so we really have to look at the whole of the human family and gestate the whole of the things that people are learning to even begin to come up with some generality that encompasses them all you see what i mean so so in some cases we can be learning love we can be learning generosity we can be learning strength of self we can be learning physical defense we can be learning surrendering physical defense what one person is growing into in one lifetime another person may be growing out of and both of them are living their truth at a process level most of the eastern religions basically say yes you grow you activate the chakras you bring higher and higher levels of consciousness online but when your consciousness opens up to divine essence when it opens up to the you that is more real than any of your individual private incarnational use the divine you the essential you when you open up to that then you reach enlightenment but the hindus call moksha means you can escape you can leave so you once you wake up then let's get out of here there's better places to be than earth so that it's nothing not cosmology but what happened in my sessions was different than that i reached a point about halfway on my journey when all of my former lives began to come into me i was in a again a kind of a pregnant time reality of deep time and my former lives were coming in and were coming in and it was like wrapping a filament of kite string around a spool but that spring was human experience it was whole human lifetimes and they kept coming together and they reached a critical mass and when they reached a critical mass they fused into one when that happened there was a tremendous explosion of energy and a diamond luminosity exploded from my chest and that's when i began to understand and was shown that we make progress incrementally lifetime by lifetime as we incarnate but the goal is not simply to make incremental progress the goal eventually is that all of our lives come infused into one and we become on earth a being who has a hundred thousand hundreds of thousands of years of history in it awakened within it and empowered within it that is the being that we are becoming and that is a different kind of being than an egoic being it's the vast depth of its heart is deep is bigger the breath of its mind is bigger the texture of its social relationships is bigger and its relationship to nature is different because it knows that the world we leave is the world we inherit it has a deeper embodied texture of its relationship with nature and my discovery was that this is not simply a path of individuals this is simply a story of individual spiritual awakening that we are all going into this transition we are all giving birth to the diamond soul the entire species is at a point in its history where it can no longer afford the luxury of trying to live on this planet in the fragmented egoic state when the world order is created by egos it leads to a fragmented order that serves some and not others but when the soul wakes up to the with the profound compassion of its history the soul lives on this planet differently than the ego does and i think we are coming into a very profound tumultuous period of history which i think of as a birth process it will feel like a death process and it is a death process it's basically destroying the culture that was built by the ego and destroying the ego which built that culture and in that process of dying to that which is small giving birth to something new giving birth literally to a new stage in the human story not a new body politic and new economics and a a shift i think is taking place at the depths of the collective unconscious the plate tectonics of the collective psyche are shifting in that jungian sense deep deep down inside the human psyche this transformation is taking place so that all human beings who are born after this transition will be living their individual life within the matrix of a different collective psyche that i think is the work of the hour and that's what we are working to and part of this to actualize and part of this is reawakening to the divine presence which we've stripped out of nature tried to unsuccessfully but reawakening to this common ground that we have with nature to this intelligence that surrounds us and saturates us wow chris i mean i'm imagining the people hearing this for the first time it's kind of difficult to get your head around it and i want to think what i want to bring colin in in a minute so to summarize in my kind of uh terms and what you're talking about really is is the evolution of the human species individuals and collectively towards a position where we can remember our entire history so if we take reincarnation as a given then we're evolving towards a place where we can remember past our past incarnations on this earth and you know colin can i bring you in here because there's something that you uh talk about you know in reanimating ourselves we need to have a completely new cognitive framework you know that the the the the way of connecting to the intelligence in the universe is so foreign to us now that we need a whole different framework to kind of be able to wrestle with with that kind of information what's your feeling about what chris is talking about i know you've read the book too and i know you love it so biased question here but yeah from your perspective thanks rachel uh well first of all i i really wanted to say how much of an honor it is to meet you chris um i i have to say you know the encounter with your books and the first one i encountered was dark knight early dawn was was really um well tectonic in nature for me it was and i'm filled with questions and was and have been all the way through uh reading your books and rereading them and reading them again and thinking about it and brewing on it and a lot of the questions i really want to ask i i have no idea how i would even articulate i can feel them and i can sense them but how um and i you know so i mean i can feel myself at the sort of edges you know of my what i call my present cognition because you know i was i was lucky enough to be born into and brought up within a traditional indigenous culture here in southern africa um and through through my childhood lived in wilderness and among people who had a very very particular relationship with wilderness and the cosmology that came out of that and subsequently i find myself you know in in in in the worlds of of uh um posting a post-industrial world trying to reconcile that part of me with the part of me i find myself in now um and and finding that that is it's very difficult to bring it feels like in a certain sense that there are two cognitive frameworks within me at some level and that somehow i'm tasked with trying to reconcile these two parts of myself and reading reading through your books you know where i found myself i found myself pulled back into the cognitive system really that i i grew up in and it forms a kind of an understructure within my experience now um and but i mean within that then i have i have questions i mean loads of them which which your books really really brought up in me and and among them among the most um difficult to articulate are questions around time and and the notion that somehow rather you know so reincarnation is not something that really comes into the cosmologies here in southern africa and yet it does it's it's implicit in certain terms but i'm really so so as we look at this idea of reincarnation and the cognitive framework that i would perceive it from here as we speak about it relies on a sequence of time that speaks of a past from which we come and a future to which we go but what happens if we take that out if in fact if in fact that's nearly my present cognitive framework but you know how would we understand uh reincarnation and the notion of a trajectory towards something if time in its kind of sequence from beginning to seeming culmination or some such thing if that wasn't the case um yeah i don't know if i'm making any sense that's making sense it's a good question if you uh if we eliminate the arrow of time then reincarnation begins to look like multi-incarnation not reincarnation some people have conceptualized as we're living all of our lives simultaneously in a and and that we're interacting all these lives are active and interacting in a way that befuddles the logic of linear development and it requires a different kind of logic and i've tried to think in that world multiple times and i basically keep coming down to i can't do it i mean i literally cannot live in a world where multi-incarnate makes sense i can't make it make sense uh now another little thread robert monroe from the monroe institute of applied science out of body guy you know has been wrote three wonderful books in the out-of-body state exploring the universe daily from the out of body state he says you reach a point in your spiritual development where you discover that you can incarnate in any time period you wish so soul forward does not mean time forward right so you can incarnate in the 10th century bc and next you could incarnate in the 20th century a b so permeability of time you see how that continues the concept of linear development but it it flexes on the concept of times absolute linearity for myself i've gone through so many permutations of time moving into deep time where you can ex i i experienced my entire life in the early stages earth to death simultaneously present absolutely i was experiencing the whole of my life the end and the beginning and all of its development as a simultaneous later i was taken into periods of time where a hundred thousand years were being lived out as if it were one minute it's convinced me that the universe has many modalities of time built into it that when we move into deeper dimensionals of reality there are different modalities of time that are available there all that which you would think and it does make me receptive to the idea of letting go of a concept of linear time and linear development and somehow i try to reconcile the fact that from the universe's perspective there are multiple modalities of time so that the universe can show me the future from its time which is and can give me the experience of knowing the future as something which has already happened and simultaneously which is yet to happen and at the same time at the same time hold on to some notion of the value and the challenge of something approximating linear development and i think my best take is that life chops it's its challenges to it it chops the learning into bits and pieces and we can't learn it all in one lifetime we can't do it all simultaneously it's easier if it's just broken down into bits and pieces um and if this if this challenge of linear development is coming to a fruition and is coming to a diamond soul a an awareness that holds all of its time moments in its present consciousness on earth this of course is not the end of the developmental story of the linear story because in a million years we'll be farther in a billion years will be farther still the universe is just getting warmed up you know is that we have no reason for thinking that the universe is is in anywhere near the end of its evolutionary story we know it's really at the early stages of its story so i think of time as one of the great gifts of evolution individuality is one of the great gifts of the physical universe time is one of the gifts of the physical universe behind that they lies permutations of metaphysics that put that are more fluid with respect to time but inside space time i think there is a an approximate linear arrow of time which serves the soul's purpose which serves some deeper cosmic web and yet at the same time when we are in the linear development if we open up to the universe if we open up to the universe's sense of time we often get these flashes of more than more than the present you know more parallel dimensions of time so your question makes a lot of sense and it's it's a substantive question can i ask one colin or do you want to come back on that okay so yeah great this is the problem with your work chris we need to keep trying to we're we're out in kind of like um inarticulable uh terrain aren't we um when we get to that what you call the diamond soul then when there's this moment of um remembering what what are the other attributes what are the other kind of what does that bring other than remembering and wholeness you know did you have an experience of what else well first of all i think full consciousness is what we return to when we die so while we're in the bardo earth bartle earth kind of stage when we die we return to whole consciousness so it's not something we're unfamiliar with it's something we are familiar with and then we precipitate out of whole consciousness into part consciousness egoic consciousness and we return so it's a it's a constant accordion kind of effect we die as we get large we're born we get small we die we get large we're born we get small sooner or later if we just keep up for a few thousand years 100 million years sooner or later large wakes up inside physical consciousness and so it's a it's simply a consolidation of what's taking place naturally normally it's just a stage in this process the times that i've been carried into deep time and experienced temporarily my diamond soul and then the diamond stool the soul that's emerging as an archetypal imprint an archetypal form it's hard to describe because of the uh enormity and the beauty and the joy we're we're looking we're talking about a human being that's completely healed of all the wounds of history that's healed of all the terrible things we've done to each other men and women and wars and violence it's healed all those scars healed a tremendous breath of communion with the natural world an intimacy with all life forms not only then a breath of companionship with all life and with other human beings and with human community and with natural nature's community but an openness of the mind able to take in more directly enter into deeper communion with the intelligence of the universe i mean the genius of the universe has all the answers to all the technological limit questions we we want to have answers to and we just are not able to download all that knowledge and the diamond soul is a more complete and higher potency of human being that can enter into deeper downloads from the divine intelligence but it's not only an expansion of heart and an expansion of mine our physical senses are also amplified my orders of magnitude in the very very last session after 73 sessions the very last session the universe gave me an experience of what i called diamond vision suddenly in a kind of a late late session wind down clear space my vision became thousands of times more cute and sharper than it had ever been before i could see things details gradients of color sharpness and precision of form i could just see i i was amazed that i ever had accepted this fuzzy stuff as real seeing this was diamond clarity scene and then after 10 minutes it went away and i was seeing the way i normally see and that's when i discovered i realized what i was being shown is that we tend to think of sensation as kind of a biomechanical process but it's actually a conscious process and the more consciousness which is pre is present in this body this body has built into it the capacity for infinitely higher levels of sensate experience touch hearing seeing sensitivities of all manner of physical sensations so it truly is it's heaven and on earth in the body so that the body participates in the qualities of heaven without having to leave the physical existence that's why i mean it's not an up and out cosmology it's bringing it in deeper and deeper and deeper changing literally the physiology of the body to allow it to operate in this ecstatic state which becomes the normal state yeah that is a child i think is it's worth the labor that we're going into to give birth to and we are going in a terribly terribly severe labor our past is being stripped away will be stripped away we will lose all capacities that we associate with normal and minimal existence this is what happens in all mystical traditions in all psychedelic traditions literally the small has to be broken ground to dust stripped and dismembered in order for the new to awaken within us and this is happening now historically where we're entering into what i think of as the dark knight of our collective soul the dark night is an image often used for a hard time but it's not a hard time in john of the cross the dark matter itself is a hard time the dark night of the soul is a very very intense purification time which immediately precedes the awakening of full elimination and the dark night of the of the collective soul is a time of intense purification intense loss of reality as we have known it up to this point in time and i think out of the out of the pain and suffering that's coming it's going to crack us open and and break us down to our center and [Music] in this ordeal we will not survive but we will give birth to that in us which is more beautiful more ecstatic more competent more plugged in i think we truly are becoming a species of buddhas species of christs and prophets these are the models we've had trying to give us some forevision of what's happening in the early years we could not imagine ordinary human being reaching that level of excellence but now we're beginning to understand through reincarnation over and over and over and over again slowly we grow into that level of excellence which is simply a level of transparency to the essential condition [Music] which in which we experience life the irony is we experience what's always been happening all the way along it's always been this way the universe has always been one the universe has always been filled with intelligence we have always been empty of self but somehow we distracted ourselves from thinking that that's not there it's always been there so we're waking up to the paradise that the universe already is we've just been missing it chris i i just find your experience and your vision just such a hopeful one as we move into what we see as ecological crisis and societal crisis and i i just again as i felt quite emotional said at the beginning it was just one of the most inspiring books or the most inspiring book last year but what one of the most of my lifetime you know i i'm sure colin would agree with me on that so it's so wonderful to hear you speak we have 10 minutes i wonder if anybody had any questions um i appreciate it's quite a lot to take on but um please do raise your hand if you have anything to ask chris also to say we've invited chris back because back later uh in the year to be with us um a bit more so there'll be more opportunity to talk with him does anybody have a question otherwise i'm going to pick on colin again because i know you've got a list colin rachel maybe i can speak to the question i put in the chat it was really for stefan but it was kind of a tiny tiny gesture towards some sense of rightness and these much much bigger movements that we can't even begin to fathom and then uh chris used to spoken that on paradigms that i've never heard before and part of me feels so extremely joyful and like rachel i'm kind of want to weep because at the same time and as we are entering this dark night of the soul which i think most of us kind of know we can feel it and uh it's as i don't know you know it i feel like small and i'm a mother of three kids and i you know and i'm trying to understand how to be a mother in this moment in time and to love my children well and i'm not very sure how to do that so it's a very human thing but it's the sort of smallest fractals of all the other things if i can make any sense in that and i just wondered if you could speak to that a little bit no uh a couple thoughts one of them is first i i absolutely identify with what you're saying i have three children and uh parenting is of the age and the age we're going into is going to be different than the parenting of the age we're coming out of because you know we're trying to inculcate a different set of values in our children as we internalize these values ourselves and i think that's how nature works each one of us is a cell within a fractal cell within a tissue of consciousness and the tissue of the body and we are as we actualize the future in our individual eyes we catalyze an actualization of the future in our collective lives and we do it not simply by example we do it because every person who internalizes and becomes the future that we know we need to become they become a seed catalyst which psychically activates the web of transformation in people they will never know they will never meet necessarily but it's there just as we have been nourished by the ancestors we have been nourished by other people who are making transformation our transformation nourishes other people this came out in my sessions multiple times that the states of consciousness i was entering into were being fed into the collective psyche we're filtering into the collective psyche so when we do ritual at dawn when we do rituals of embracing the sun as as a representative of this larger collective intelligence when we do rituals of conservation and cultivate a lifestyle of using less and doing more when we actualize those things we make it that much easier for the entire species a whole to actualize those things until eventually we come to a tipping point right and at the tipping point the uncommon sense starts to become common sense and this you know this transformation is not something that's going to happen to us though i think there is a way in which nature knows what it is doing we are not generating this transformation nature is doing it nature is taking us through it but we are cooperating with this process and it's not going to be handed to us we have to create it we have to create it out of the fabric of our being where we are living and here's a very another consoling thought when you look at the reincarnation literature you look at the near-death episode literature one thing it becomes very clear we choose the incarnations that we find ourselves in so at a time when we knew more we knew what we were getting into we knew what this century was going to be about we knew that the dark night of the soul was coming upon us we made a choice to incarnate where we did and to become the people that we are we and so therefore each one of us carries a component of the transformation that humanity is trying to make each one of us is the question is not what what can we do the question is do we have the courage to do what is within our reach to do because what is within our reach has already been decided by the soul okay so parenting is a big part of this transition everything that we're doing art medicine knowledge communication technology is a big part of this transition we're working it as we go oh thank you chris thank you great thank you so much for sticking with us um i can see some hands up here just to say we have rocketed over time um we were going to edit it to be less than an hour but when we came to do the editing we found that we couldn't and i really wanted to include that question at the end because it's very much brings it down to what can we do um so apologies for that um we'd love you to stay a little bit longer to uh to kind of share your thoughts um i saw two hands up there one was carol another one was isabella carol would you like to go first if you unmute yourself okay gabby can you unmute are we all so the technology you can everyone can unmute themselves fantastic carol thank you um yeah i'm sort of rendered speechless but but um i i wanted to ask what i thought i heard chris say was at the end there was that our task is to tune in to who we really are in this lifetime and live that and that's the best we can do because my first question was what what ritual can i do what task you know would would accelerate this process but it sounds like from what he says that that's not what it's about it's about living what we've dreamt in for this lifetime would you agree with that or comment on that that's certainly what i heard and actually if you read the book i think that's pretty much what he's saying as well colin would you like to comment on that um yeah i think that is very much what he's saying i mean you know a lot of what he says um in in the duration of this talk it's a it's a tiny fragment of much much bigger body of work um you know dating back into stan groff's work and so on so to really get a sense of what each of the little statements he makes the importance of what he's saying it's it's kind of it's helpful to have a have have have that within the context of the much bigger picture um but i think you know um yeah as i was as i was we were coming to the end of this i suddenly thought back and i thought i made a mistake when i um during the introduction i said oh you know i spoke of the subtitle of his book as being the new ecology of mind steps towards the new equality of mind when in fact it steps towards the deep ecology of mind but but i think that you know that that's um that having listened to the talk you can probably realize why i made that mistake because we're we're in a moment now which is unprecedented i mean any moment of experience is unprecedented we are we are as individuals as a collective as a globe as a universe this is an unprecedented moment and yet at the same time we come out of a long long long long history um that this this new component of who we are is so on one level we're we're pulling back into we're go we're potentially um and what we once did much more effectively i think is we we go back into our our historic roots our experiential historic roots our psycho spiritual historic roots and we draw into informing this present moment those what we've gathered in that time but then in that moment also we potentially translate it into a response to the newness of where we are now and i really think that's the task of our time uh and the part that we're not doing very well at the moment is this reaching back into the vast um form of who we who we are is is kind of is expressed also in our long long long long long history our trajectory of where we've come from to get here so so i think that um you know the totality of who we are is is as chris points out it's kind of always there um it's always naturally going on but we we compress ourselves into a fragment of that and a lifetime is in a certain sense that but equally and as importantly i think this particular time that we're in now you know what i tend to refer to as an industrial cultural global globalized time is even more so you know because i think we've we've condensed ourselves and retracted ourselves retracted the notion of who we are into a an even tinier fragment than we might have done previously and so um i do think what we're tasked with right now very very fundamentally is remembering on the one hand which is going back and finding ways of re-entering into what is inherently in us which is our past which is dynamically still presence in us and active in us and at the same time springing out of that into a dreaming of who we are now and what is asked of us in this in this moment what is what what does it mean now to be in this newness and this as chris so beautifully puts it this tectonic um profoundly all-encompassing seeming change of what it means to be human and and and presumably what it means to be a universe at some level um so i think you know it's a what you're asking is an incredibly important question and i think it's a huge one and and probably one which needs a considerable amount of pondering but i'll say that for the time being yeah yeah um my experience in this lifetime is many many different ways of being and um i'm aware of the sort of small selves that just gets on with everyday life and doesn't and isn't really doing much but then there's part of me that is doing much more interesting stuff or much more spiritual stuff and um my question with that is can i relax and let that happen will it happen or should i be focusing you know should i be there's always this worry isn't there that the world's gonna end and we haven't done enough and all that kind of anxiety that comes from the industrial setup here but there's no answer probably one to brew one yeah it's always brewing oh isabella you had a question you're gonna have to unmute i'm afraid oh yes really thank you um it's my name is actually christina but i'm on my walters laptop sorry so that's why the zoom is is named um isabella um it's maybe more of an observation or i don't know exactly but um i have to admit that i haven't read that book yet um but i had many of my own experiences of of lsd and ayahuasca when i was young and it has certainly informed my life and i would you know completely agree with so so so many things that he said um up to now and i have been thinking about this a long time but never very scientifically but just try to live by what i had experienced and learned but one thing always puzzled me because like he said at the very beginning it is um to taking off of the drugs is a shortcut to an opening into a world in a way i always felt that and i always felt that um it it has kind of helped me to have a bigger understanding of the universe and of many many things that he has been talking about and in particular to all these connections and to the connections also to my ancestry and to the wisdom of my ancestors and and i always felt an obligation in some ways for some strange reason to try and share this with others and in my case i did try to do that mostly through art but then my observation was that we are all on so many in different stages in our lives and in our i suppose i don't know in that so-called journey or you know whatever that it's very very difficult to often try and explain all these things that we can actually see in all these connections to people who may not have had the privilege of of being opening the mind and so i've often wondered if we say we about the collective well does that actually really exist you know is that does that time that we are apparently entering exist as a collective or is it just some who are at a certain stage in their um rebirth or reincarnation or whatever it is and you know does that actually is there even a sort of a time of that or is that some somehow an illusion we have created for ourselves to try and understand things i don't know i'm not sure if i make myself clear it's really difficult to talk about these things i'm thinking of what he was saying about um if if the individual does it then it kind of adds to the collective and i'm just thinking of rupert sheldrake's morphic resonance um colin will be able to kind of talk more about that but i i just wonder if it's that kind of process at work that when once the individuals start then it just becomes easier for the collective is that what you're saying christina i i may have understood yes i mean i i'm not sure what i'm saying it's more that i'm asking i've often you know there is there's maybe this this worry or this doubt because i have become very very aware and hopefully tried at least very hard to to to live my life in a way that being very aware of every thing you say and everything every gesture one does and you know every pebble you drop into the pond has a as a you know yeah it does make some sort of a little wave perhaps and it touches things and it changes things and it changes the universe if you wish um so there is that awareness but i'm not sure that that awareness is really the same for everybody and yes it does make a big difference but at the same time we are worrying about an age we are entering right now and i do don't get me wrong and i like you know to think about this but at the same time i'm sort of thinking hang on a minute in a way that doesn't really make sense in the big scheme of the universe because it has all it's already there it has already been it's already you know whatever comes it's not particularly new entrance into something because some people are at this stage another surprise or or some you know we have already had it's it's not the same exactly but it's it's not necessarily very specific just to our very lifetime here and now because the same pains the same choice the same thing has it been experienced a million million times for in a way and it is in the end about the individual which also has been historically named so many times like interestingly what carol says it is it is like the greek poets have been very clear about saying and become who you are in a way and that's that's development isn't it that i'm to have that understanding of the universe and of the vastness and of the lack of boundaries in a way and that everything is interconnected absolutely everything so i don't know anyway thank you so much christopher and i'm sure that we could like really explore that we have about six minutes left teresa's got a question before and i come to youtube's i just wanted to say as well just in case people have to go um so chris is going to come back as part of our contemporary animism program which starts again in july we have a new intake every year so we still have some places on that somebody was saying that they'd love to jackie you were saying that you'd love to explore this kind of um subject more that's what we're hoping to do in this year's um programme breathing workshops absolutely again jackie you're saying that it'd be wonderful to have a breathing workshop i'm hoping that we're going to do that as part of this program as well but yes absolutely breath work uh certainly for me it's where it's at um yeah so therese i wanted to come to you and if anybody has one put up your digital hand and we'll try and get them in but please lovely to see you um it's just a comment i don't know uh i haven't read his books i haven't actually heard of him before but it's just an observation of something that he he said that even though he kind of rejects the transcendent thought of or the thought of transcending earthly bodily reality like you find in much eastern thought he still presents an idea that by um that fits very neatly with our western thought of evolution and development and i'm i'm not sure quite what i think about that it's like he he takes something old evolutionary thought and rejects it and he presents uh rip um replaces it with another one and i i don't know i guess i'd like to see more of using his experience as a way to [Music] accept that time isn't linear and things exists at the same time in different layers here and now and not necessarily for a means but just that this is how it is i'm not sure if i'm making much sense but um yeah yeah do you have a response on that colin uh well i think you're opening a it's a kind of door handle thing where we could we could spend the rest of the night on this topic yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah important one i'm sorry it's very important and and i i i think you're raising some very interesting question it kind of harkens back into my my question around time and how we perceive things um you know and when we we have this notion i think that as western well as humanity that we have a certain way of perceiving time and that that's what being that's part of being human i don't agree with that i think that the way we perceive time and the way we perceive the the nature of sequential events is very characteristic of a particular moment in our history as human beings and is definitely not necessarily the case in our earlier states and perhaps won't be in our future states either um so so in a way but what we what we are what we have to struggle with is the fact that we are indeed immersed within this framework that we call present existence you know in in the particular cultural socio-cultural kind of framework that we're in and you know and so when we have these conversations you know we're we're tasked with um modulating to other views and other perspectives that we might have within us and within our history and so on you know circular dynamics as opposed to linear dynamics and so on but at the same time i think we we're we're also tasked with coming back to risk with rest within where we are in order to uh not get completely lost in the translative process that we're trying to do so you know i think that i mean i don't really i wouldn't know how to answer the question exactly but uh you know i i think that we um i'm opening a can that could last forever now let me stop there but i think it's a really good question and i think it's an interesting thing to ponder further yeah thank you which we're gonna have to do because it's time or it's time a long time ago actually i do apologize for keeping you longer than you're expecting um lovely to see you look we have a small little group that made it to the end um [Music] yes don't know what more to say really that was chris batch check out his books um have a look at our contemporary animism program if you want to do more of that kind of conversation we also do a lot of embodied stuff as well it's not just all uh talking so um lovely to see you tonight everybody and uh see you very soon bye for now thank you gabby thank you colin thank you for coming thank you very much thank you bye [Music] thank you</p>

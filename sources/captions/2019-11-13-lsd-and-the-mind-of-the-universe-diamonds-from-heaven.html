      <p>Welcome hello everybody I'm Jessica DiRuzza</p>
<p>from Trust Psyche and it is such a joy to be able to spend the Sunday together this is</p>
<p>our free monthly try psyche livestream that we host right here every first Sunday of the month</p>
<p>all are welcome so please invite your friends we host a variety of speakers on a myriad of topics</p>
<p>and you can find out more about us at recipe.com and you can sign up for these live streams</p>
<p>at truss psyche comm backslash live stream to participate live and to ask your questions</p>
<p>if you value what we do here today the best way you can support us is by subscribing to our</p>
<p>youtube channel liking this video and sharing it with all of your friends i'm very honored and</p>
<p>excited to present our guest speaker for today Chris Bache who's going to be presenting on his</p>
<p>forthcoming book LSD and The Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven released this November 26.</p>
<p>You can pre-order your copy today through Amazon. Up until the 1700s humans believed that the</p>
<p>edge of our universe ended at the planet Saturn the last visible planet that we can see with the</p>
<p>unaided eye with the invention of the telescope we turned it to the heavens and to our great surprise</p>
<p>we discovered the planet Uranus twice as far out as the planet Saturn our universe doubled in size</p>
<p>then in the 1800s with the discovery of Neptune our universe once again doubled in size then in</p>
<p>1931 with the discovery of Pluto our universe then again doubled in size and now less than 400 years</p>
<p>later from the discovery of Uranus we have the deep space Hubble telescope which shows us that</p>
<p>there are trillions upon trillions of galaxies in our universe for me this is analogous to the</p>
<p>work that Chris has done and his deep exploration of consciousness radically breaking open and</p>
<p>through our cosmology and our philosophy and our metaphysics through the 73 high dose LSD sessions</p>
<p>that he did it over 20 years and began to share with us in his work dark night early dawn steps</p>
<p>to a deep ecology of mind now with LSD and the mind of the universe Chris takes us further into</p>
<p>Diamond luminosity and brings back the diamonds from heaven that he so graciously shares with</p>
<p>all of us here today there couldn't be a more important time for Chris to share his work with</p>
<p>all of us both in the greater understanding and acceptance of psychedelics today but also because</p>
<p>of the psycho spiritual death and rebirth that our collective human species seems to be going through</p>
<p>right now so please help me give a very warm and loving welcome to our beloved friend Chris Bosh</p>
<p>and when Chris is done speaking you each have an opportunity to ask your questions so please</p>
<p>have those ready as that is our favorite and those special part of these live streams thank you</p>
<p>so much for being with us here today hi everyone Thank You Jessica and Travis thank you for this</p>
<p>opportunity to share my work with participants intrapsychic aam it is truly an honor to do so</p>
<p>it's also an overwhelming task because this book covers so many dimensions of consciousness</p>
<p>it covers so many years of work and when I talk about it I have a tendency to get absorbed</p>
<p>naturally into the experience as I'm describing and that makes compressing 20 years of work and</p>
<p>20 years of thinking and writing into a very short presentation really challenging so to me a talk</p>
<p>is the most effective way to get to question and answers so I'll try to keep this contained and</p>
<p>as brief as I can and then save a good half hour at the end for Q&amp;A and we'll see where that goes</p>
<p>maybe even more than a half an hour so I'm going to start with a little bit of background first</p>
<p>of all those are you who know me and some of you don't know me the last person you would expect to</p>
<p>have written a book on psychedelics I was raised in the deep south in Mississippi I was raised</p>
<p>in a middle-class Catholic background I wanted to be a salmon priest early in my life was in the</p>
<p>seminary for three years in high school I studied theology at Notre Dame New Testament criticism at</p>
<p>Cambridge and then philosophy of religion at Brown by the time I had finished graduate school I was</p>
<p>a atheistic Lee inclined agnostic and the 60s had completely passed me by I was not psychedelically</p>
<p>involved in in my college or graduate school at all so I was naive psychedelically and I was an</p>
<p>atheistic Lee inclined agnostic philosophically and then came Ellis team shortly after beginning</p>
<p>my career I met the work of Stan Grof and that set my life on the course that I'm still harvesting</p>
<p>today so first let me start a PowerPoint that I'll be using and then I'm gonna keep this on</p>
<p>only for about 10 minutes and then I'll shift in and out of it again later let me see if I can</p>
<p>get this started here this is what the book will look like and I'll tell you a secret about this</p>
<p>book this is the publishers title LSD in the mind of the universe my title is diamonds from</p>
<p>heaven because diamonds from heaven is a story of a journey what they wanted a more marketable</p>
<p>title and that's LSD in the mind of the universe the beginning of this book goes back 40 years</p>
<p>over 40 years when I had begun graduate school in 78 right then I met the work of stanislav</p>
<p>grof his book realms of the human unconscious turned my life around followed quickly by LSD</p>
<p>psychotherapy he gave me the method and the confidence to pursue the method of exploring my</p>
<p>consciousness and through that exploration to come to know the deep psyche the deep universe</p>
<p>better I want to emphasize that I did this work as a philosopher I was not a therapist I was not</p>
<p>primarily seeking healing though healing did come but I was seeking to understand our universe as</p>
<p>deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness as deeply as I could so a few observations</p>
<p>on method and then we'll kind of go right into the content everyone is aware I think of the</p>
<p>distinction between low-dose psycholytic therapy that stand develops and high-dose psychedelic</p>
<p>therapy low dose psychedelic therapy peels the mind gradually layer by layer in very intense</p>
<p>therapeutic encounters psychedelic therapy is a very different protocol it's a protocol trying</p>
<p>to trick her in the early days who are trying to trigger a near-death experience for people who</p>
<p>had terminal cancer they were trying to heal them but to trigger an encounter with the universe</p>
<p>that would open them to the world that they were about to enter when I began my own work I chose</p>
<p>to work with high doses of LSD primarily because it was simply difficult to get time to arrange</p>
<p>a day of inter journeying with the dual-career marriage and I wanted to make the most out of</p>
<p>every day that I could put into this I thought of myself as basically doing an extended regimen</p>
<p>of psychedelic therapy doing just psychedelic therapy but for a longer period of time originally</p>
<p>psychedelic therapy was limited to a maximum of three sessions and I thought well you could</p>
<p>do three sessions with this work safely you could do it more sessions and do it safely when</p>
<p>I got to the end of this journey and was looking back over sláinte I began to appreciate that what</p>
<p>happened in my work was different than what I saw being recorded reported in psychedelic therapy so</p>
<p>different that I thought it needed a new kind of language to describe it so I've chosen the term</p>
<p>psychedelic exploration psychedelic exploration is the method of psychedelic therapy isolation</p>
<p>earphones had headphones music total protection with the sitter the difference is the number of</p>
<p>sessions involved in my case 73 high-dose sessions between 1979 and 1999 I worked for four years I</p>
<p>stopped for six years for reasons that I described in the book and then I resumed for a very intense</p>
<p>10-year process I did this work between when I was thirty and fifty years old I'm now 70 years</p>
<p>old so I've taken a long time to present this work completely candidly to the world partly</p>
<p>for legal reasons and partly because it simply takes a long time it took me a long time to map</p>
<p>and understand all the dynamics of the sessions that unfolded during these years I want to say</p>
<p>at the outset that this is not a methodology that I would recommend today if I were doing it over</p>
<p>again I would be gentler on myself I would take a slower process of engaging the great expanse of</p>
<p>the mind of the universe I would balance high-dose work with low dose sessions I would also balance</p>
<p>working with LSD with working with psilocybin and ayahuasca more body grounded psychedelics for</p>
<p>a variety of reasons all of which I discuss in the book don't have time to go into here I tried</p>
<p>to do this work as systematically and rigorously as I can working as a philosopher I made it a high</p>
<p>priority to make a complete and phenomenologically accurate record of my sessions within 24 hours and</p>
<p>then studied the sessions and the dynamics arcing across sessions and comparing my experiences</p>
<p>to those who were that had been had by other psychedelic journey errs this is a snapshot of</p>
<p>my journal about 400 pages my psychedelic notes that for me are my personal Bible they are the</p>
<p>record of my deepest experiences of the universe and therefore in my life they come before all</p>
<p>other discursive thinking and analytic analysis kept detailed records of my sessions all the way</p>
<p>through I looked at and studied the astrological transits of my sessions trying I was aware of</p>
<p>Rick and Stan's thinking about the relationship between the outer transits the outer planets and</p>
<p>the global transits and how they affect one's work in deep non-ordinary states so I wanted to study</p>
<p>this hypothesis myself and look at how my sessions projected against the rhythms of the solar system</p>
<p>during the years I was doing this work I want to emphasize that the story I'm telling in LSD</p>
<p>in the mind of the universe is not primarily a personal story I mean it is a personal story at</p>
<p>one level but in another sense it's not primarily a personal story this series of curves represents</p>
<p>a series of LSD sessions and I found that after the first 15 sessions or so when I was working</p>
<p>insights and help in my personal life tended to come at the beginning and end of my sessions as</p>
<p>I was leaving and returning to time-space reality that's reflected in these small circles when the</p>
<p>session was in its peak hours represented by the large circles I was usually operating beyond curse</p>
<p>my personal reality beyond Chris Bhatia's reality not entirely but largely and so the story I'm</p>
<p>telling in LSD in the mind of the universe is the story of what unfolded in those large circles</p>
<p>at the peak hours of my psychedelic sessions this is primarily a cosmological narrative it's</p>
<p>not primarily a therapeutic narrative the details the personal details are important in a</p>
<p>therapeutic not work narrative it's not so much in a cosmological narrative I found when I did this</p>
<p>work that what unfolded in my work was a series a multiple series of experiences of death and</p>
<p>rebirth that eventually kind of concretize dinh to this picture the drop below the line that line</p>
<p>is kind of represents the border of time-space the drop below the line is egoic reality our</p>
<p>individual space time consciousness and the first death and rebirth which is the one most</p>
<p>frequently talked about in the literature is ego death which takes place in that first level when</p>
<p>we make the transition from ordinary consciousness into early trance personal consciousness but if</p>
<p>you continue to work and press the limits of your experience I found that there are other deaths</p>
<p>which take place at other levels of consciousness and wife I look Stan Grof in using the vocabulary</p>
<p>of psychic subtle and causal reality to describe some of these deeper levels of consciousness</p>
<p>I don't have a vested interest in how many levels of reality there might be or how many</p>
<p>times the circle of death and rebirth may turn what's important is the principle that if</p>
<p>s one pushes deeper and deeper and deeper if you do this work systematically</p>
<p>there are a series of deaths and rebirths that open in the process</p>
<p>as I have looked back and mapped these circles oversimplify of course these</p>
<p>are a number of sessions and what is shown here is the sort of circles within circles the</p>
<p>deaths within deaths that mark a deepening of progressive deepening into causal level reality so</p>
<p>yeah circles within circles when I looked over the entirety of all of my psychedelic work identified</p>
<p>five fundamental death rebirth processes or levels of consciousness where death and rebirth were</p>
<p>operating these are the five levels first the death of self by which I mean the death of our</p>
<p>time-space identity as our individual identity as our sense of who and what we are moving into</p>
<p>collective mind there are three chapters in the book dealing with the dynamics of collective mind</p>
<p>the ocean of suffering deep time then archetype Lamine experiences that the high archetypal</p>
<p>level experienced it the Lord archetypal level followed by immersion in causal oneness oneness</p>
<p>services of course much earlier in the sequence but there is something quite distinctive about</p>
<p>causal level oneness and finally the diamond luminosity work after everything that had taken</p>
<p>place before emerging into the diamond light that Buddhism calls dharmakaya I call the diamond</p>
<p>luminosity so let me before turning off the power point let me simply take you through</p>
<p>a list of the chapters of LSD in the mind of the universe there is a methodology chapter</p>
<p>chapter one but then in terms of the content of the experiences crossing the boundary of birth and</p>
<p>death the ocean of suffering deep time in the soul initiation into the universe the greater real of</p>
<p>archetypal reality a benediction of blessings the birth of the future human diamond and Manasa</p>
<p>tea and final vision and then there is the last chapter coming off the mountain it took me</p>
<p>actually a year just to write that last chapter that is a chapter in which I reflect on what has</p>
<p>been happening in my life in the 20 years after I stopped my psychedelic work what I'll do is go</p>
<p>through each of these chapters and simply mention a few points on each of the chapters work through</p>
<p>the list as quickly as I can and then we'll open it up for questions and answers let me keep track</p>
<p>of my time okay first crossing the boundary of life and death is the one that's easiest because</p>
<p>it's most familiar it's so thoroughly described in stan grof literature when I entered this domain</p>
<p>which took about two and a half years to navigate and ten sessions my work began Sacher became</p>
<p>saturated with confrontations with death fetal sensations all sorts of severe perinatal seizures</p>
<p>a purging of the body eventually culminating in ego death my ego death basically involved a</p>
<p>complete reversal of everything that I knew myself to be at the time I was an academic a</p>
<p>white male academic philosopher passionately concerned with the meaning of life I became</p>
<p>the complete opposite of that I became women women of color women who were not interested in</p>
<p>philosophical reflection at all I became it was a frightening experience a terrifying experience</p>
<p>but when I let go when I let go and allowed myself to become all these women who were so different</p>
<p>from me I entered the world of women and was given the experience of hundreds and hundreds of women</p>
<p>under the arm with a great mother it was a truly life-changing experience for me and I wish every</p>
<p>man could have that experience when I went into when I went through that death and rebirth process</p>
<p>and went into continued to work I entered into a domain of suffering and pain and agony collective</p>
<p>pain and suffering that was so severe I came to call it the ocean of suffering so let me back up</p>
<p>just for a second working at these levels as I did it every session basically had two phases a</p>
<p>first phase which was a purification phase and a second phase which was the ecstatic phase the</p>
<p>purification phase would be some type of very profound cathartic purification engagement</p>
<p>and if that was allowed to continue to its culmination there was some type of a breakthrough</p>
<p>and then the recession's pivoted to an ecstatic portion for the remainder of the session when I'm</p>
<p>describing the ocean of suffering I'm describing the purification phase of the next two years of</p>
<p>work tremendous suffering at first I thought this was a deepening of ego death I thought somehow</p>
<p>that pieces of my ego were still in play and that this collective suffering represented a deepening</p>
<p>of ego death but eventually this continued for so long and it was so severe that I came to a</p>
<p>different conclusion the conclusion I came to is that somewhere along the line something had</p>
<p>happened in my sessions that these ordeals were not really aimed at my personal transformation</p>
<p>at all that somewhere along the line the focus of my work at this point became actually the</p>
<p>purification and healing of some aspect of the collective psyche some aspect of the collective</p>
<p>unconscious but somehow I was tapping into pain and suffering which was lodged in the collective</p>
<p>psyche and by engaging this pain and suffering consciously it was in some way being lifted out of</p>
<p>the collective psyche and therefore lightening the kind of karmic burden that our species was holding</p>
<p>well I wrote dark night early dawn primarily to understand this whole dynamic primarily to</p>
<p>understand how my sessions how death could become as large as it became in my sessions and by</p>
<p>integrating Rupert Sheldrake's concept of morphic fields into Stan Grof paradigm the way open to</p>
<p>viewing these experiences as part of a larger transformational practice aimed at the collective</p>
<p>psyche in the ecstatic portion of these next these two years of sessions in the ecstatic portion I</p>
<p>entered into what I call deep time in the soul I and I began to have experiences of my life as</p>
<p>a completed whole from start to finish with all the time moments of my life with all the themes</p>
<p>and all the people in circumstances of my life simultaneously present and I was basically taken</p>
<p>into this territory consistently for one year over and over again seven sessions went deeper deeper</p>
<p>and was basically given a profound crash course and Chris beiges life what it was about who the</p>
<p>people were that I was involved in my life was taken into a kind of a spiritual distillation of</p>
<p>what my life was about and what it was going to be about when I first entered this reality and</p>
<p>came out of it after the session it had been the most powerful and transformative experience of</p>
<p>my life and yet I couldn't remember it after the session was over I could not hold on to trance</p>
<p>terrible experiences of this magnitude because there simply was no reference point in my ordinary</p>
<p>consciousness to anchor them but when I went back again and again and again I found that I was able</p>
<p>to hold on to these experiences more effectively I was able to remember them I was able to bring more</p>
<p>and more of them back and this is an important point if you want to enter into these states and</p>
<p>you cultivate systemic recall of the experiences in these states you have to really work with</p>
<p>a lot of discipline you have to engage them very conscientiously record them conscientiously</p>
<p>and if you hold this position well you literally learn how to become how to be stay conscious in</p>
<p>states of consciousness that previously you were not able to hold the conscious awareness in and</p>
<p>this pattern repeated every time I would break through to a new level there was always a period</p>
<p>of disorientation a period of loss of memory but then when I would keep going back over and over</p>
<p>and over again to that new level my cognition improved my perception improved my ability to</p>
<p>understand and record all the experiences improved now the ocean of suffering work I said lasted</p>
<p>two years and 14 sessions but this was actually divided into one year of work and then I took my</p>
<p>six year break and then I started my second Delic work again when I started after my six year break</p>
<p>the ocean of suffering began exactly where it had been in the first year of work so six years</p>
<p>later completely different circumstances in my life completely different expectations and</p>
<p>different astrological conditions nevertheless my sessions began exactly where they had stopped</p>
<p>which is an indication of the the intentionality of the intelligence that's guiding our work when I</p>
<p>started this after the break the ecstatic portion of the sessions began at a completely different</p>
<p>place the ecstatic portion of the sessions began in what I came to call initiation into the</p>
<p>universe I was taken systematically by some intelligence that never adopted any form but I</p>
<p>always felt an intelligence that seemed to be intent on teaching me how the universe functions</p>
<p>how it operates I was given a crash course in cosmology 101 in this material the initiation</p>
<p>of the universe I should mention I give names to my sessions I give every session a name the</p>
<p>name reflects the pith content of the session and I break the session down in bullet points the</p>
<p>names of the sessions that I gave this chapter on initiation the universe these are the sessions</p>
<p>that are discussed in that chapter you and I creating was really a crash course in cosmology</p>
<p>the cosmic tour was an extraordinary tour of the universe then there was a training session</p>
<p>and I called the Council of Elders a session which was training me and how to maintain coherent</p>
<p>consciousness as these deeper levels of awareness were opening dying into one was an extraordinary</p>
<p>immersion into oneness the master plan was the beginning of a series of visions that I'm going to</p>
<p>come back to later it was a series of initiations into what appeared to be the plan that the</p>
<p>creative intelligence had for the evolution of the human species at this point in its history</p>
<p>I know it sounds monstrously arrogant to talk like that but this is simply what happened in the</p>
<p>sessions and then healing the collective wound healing the collective wound was the ocean of</p>
<p>suffering came into a culmination it came into an extraordinary hard to describe I lay it out</p>
<p>of the book as best as I can hard to describe the magnitudes of suffering that one can enter</p>
<p>into in this work and when that work came to its crescendo I was spun from there into archetypal</p>
<p>reality and the ocean of suffering never returned in future sessions there was a lot of work there</p>
<p>was suffering but it was never this collective suffering that seemed to reflect the history of</p>
<p>the human species after the initiation of the universe I entered archetypal reality this lasted</p>
<p>about one and a half years and eleven sessions when I entered archetypal reality I entered a</p>
<p>reality that immediately was recognized as more real than physical reality every time I entered</p>
<p>this level of work I I had the sensation that I was entering a reality that was more real more</p>
<p>existentially real than time and space in fact it became very disorienting to realize how deluded</p>
<p>and watered-down reality is inside time and space reality when I entered this work my human identity</p>
<p>began to fall away from me I found that we have a sense of being human that is deeper than our</p>
<p>sense of being any individual human an ego is a death of our individual experience of being</p>
<p>human but entering archetypal reality required that I somehow let go of human experience at a</p>
<p>deeper level and eventually I could no longer fit myself back into any cognitive frame of</p>
<p>reference related to Homo sapiens I entered a level of consciousness that I experiences being</p>
<p>above and beyond human consciousness and there I was systematically worked with and given lessons</p>
<p>on how reality operated there these experiences kind of broke down and at two different levels at</p>
<p>the high platonic level at the highest level level I encountered beings that were completely beyond</p>
<p>my ability to conceptualize and understand my mind imaged them like galaxies there were just vast</p>
<p>beings that were the creators of time and space they were the creators of life on this planet</p>
<p>they were the guardians of existence they were the massive constitutional forces that actually create</p>
<p>everything that we know as times space in this magnificent universe at a lower archetypal level</p>
<p>at more of a Jungian level I was taken and given many experiences of the collective consciousness</p>
<p>our collective psyche our collective unconscious and even kind of a collective body that all</p>
<p>of our bodies are cells in I was given many experiences on how the collective psyche works</p>
<p>on how reality functions at this level these all took place primarily at subtle level reality so I</p>
<p>was given exercises and the nuts and bolts of how reality works how our individual Minds ourselves</p>
<p>within a larger mind and even how our individual bodies our cells within some kind of fundamental</p>
<p>core archetype of the human body and that when we engage and heal diseases in our individual body</p>
<p>we simultaneously are impacting the health of the human families larger body the list of the</p>
<p>sessions that I address in this chapter xxviii session was an extraordinarily positive session</p>
<p>ecstatic session in which I broke through and touched calls a level reality for the first time</p>
<p>and extremely clear lucid hard to describe state of hyper clarity and then I was quite surprised</p>
<p>to go through three sessions of just gut-wrenching cleansing just on our deal of physical</p>
<p>psychological cleansing that had absolutely no cognitive content associated with it at all</p>
<p>it's just a just a gut-wrenching cleansing in time to make a very long story short I began to realize</p>
<p>that what there is a cycle that I came to call the cycle of purification the cycle of purification</p>
<p>is that every step into a deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher level of</p>
<p>energy so that when we when I first broke into causal level reality in the 28th session I touched</p>
<p>a reality that was so pure that it triggered a purification process in my being that lasted</p>
<p>three sessions extending over six months and I found that this pattern repeated itself over and</p>
<p>over again as I continued to go deeper every time I broke into a new level of conscious and had that</p>
<p>ecstatic experience of waking up in a deeper level of reality the following sessions were very very</p>
<p>difficult very much involved in cleansing carrying out the garbage so much so that I began to dread</p>
<p>the sessions that immediately followed the major breakthrough sessions I should mention here that</p>
<p>one of the things that opened up this level is I began to experience reincarnation as a collective</p>
<p>previously and those of you who know my book on reincarnation life cycles know that the story of</p>
<p>the soul of the story I'm telling of reincarnation there is the story of our individual evolution</p>
<p>directing our individual evolution over many lifetimes reflecting our individual choices and</p>
<p>our individual learning but now I began to have experiences of the entire planet entering into a</p>
<p>reincarnation process and I experienced millions of people over time century after century millions</p>
<p>of people incarnated in a way that was integrated that was you not uniform but that was integrated</p>
<p>so that all of our individual karma our individual soul aspirations our individual challenges were</p>
<p>all part of the collective karma collective challenges and our collective development as a</p>
<p>species it was magnificently beautiful to witness this interplay between individual and collective</p>
<p>reincarnation again all of these taking place at the subtle level of reality when one was gauging</p>
<p>the deeper architecture of the universe after spending about 11 months exploring archetypal</p>
<p>reality and at going through this 11 sessions going through this very quickly I entered what I</p>
<p>came to call the benediction of blessings it was a period of extraordinary blessings just given</p>
<p>one massive blessing after another these are the names of the four sessions that I address in this</p>
<p>chapter the forest was an experience of Shunyata emptiness of self no self in me no self anywhere</p>
<p>around me an experience of radical and profound transparency the birth of the diamond soul I</p>
<p>mentioned in a second singing the universal way was an experience of primal void experience</p>
<p>had culminated in the experience of such at ananda consciousness being in bliss eventually</p>
<p>moving into a complete void the fertile void that subsumes and is the origin out of which the</p>
<p>physical university merged Jesus blood was an experience of extraordinary cosmic love love like</p>
<p>I have never known it before just super saturated soul saturated engaging of love the birth of</p>
<p>diamond soul I want to mention because it'll come up later in the work in that experience in</p>
<p>the birth of the diamond soul session which was really a deeply moving long-lasting session</p>
<p>for me I began to experience all of my former lives coming into me very fast very quickly eleven</p>
<p>years before I had experienced my entire life from beginning to end now I began to experience all my</p>
<p>lives coming in and it was like the we're wrapping kite string around a spool and at some point this</p>
<p>spool ignited It was as if we hit critical mass and all of these lives fused into a singularity</p>
<p>and when they fuse an extraordinary light broke out of my chest it was my first contact with what</p>
<p>I later called Diamond light and I think what I was being given in this session was an experience</p>
<p>of how reincarnation works and where reincarnation is taking humanity this process of accumulating</p>
<p>more and more experience more and more lives is not simply improving us and making us better</p>
<p>beings one life at a time adding a little bit here a little bit there but eventually we're</p>
<p>collecting experience and I think eventually in the entire human saga all of us are coming into a</p>
<p>stage where eventually all of our knowledge all of our experience everything we've ever done everyone</p>
<p>we've ever known through these lives there is a fusion of that knowledge and when that knowledge</p>
<p>fuses we are catapulted into a higher operational status with a different relationship to the</p>
<p>universe a greater transparency to the universe and also a different relationship with everyone</p>
<p>around us because we have been connected to each other for so many lifetimes we have been fathers</p>
<p>mothers enemies friends partners in so many lifetimes when we become whole within ourselves</p>
<p>it opens up a depth of compassion to all beings we experience around us and not just human beings</p>
<p>all beings on our planet after the benediction of blessings where the work went next was into</p>
<p>the diamond luminosity work I was completely existentially satisfied after the the benediction</p>
<p>of blessings work I had given something that I had been asked to give in the ocean of suffering and</p>
<p>I had been repaid and given more in return that I could possibly have imagined but then we went</p>
<p>into the diamond luminosity work but before I begin to tell you about that I want to back step a</p>
<p>little bit and talk about the birth of the future human because it's been a reoccurring theme in</p>
<p>my session starting all the way back to the 22nd session all the way through to the end of the</p>
<p>sessions a reoccurring theme is what is happening to the human race where are we in our evolutionary</p>
<p>journey now I tell this story in the book I've brought together in one place all of the session</p>
<p>material related to the birth of the future human in this one chapter so in the starting with</p>
<p>experiences that first appeared in chapter 6 the initiation of the universe running all the way</p>
<p>through I gathered them all together and collected them into two segments first is a segment that I</p>
<p>call the visions of awakening which are visions that I have been given in different piecemeal</p>
<p>fashion about where we are and where we are going I break this down into six visions these are the</p>
<p>six themes of our wakening what was most striking to me about this was first how dramatic this</p>
<p>process was and how the experience was that we were poised to move into an evolutionary to make</p>
<p>an evolutionary jump that would completely propel us into a higher order of functioning not only as</p>
<p>individuals but as a species we are poised on the edge of a profound Great Awakening but in all of</p>
<p>these visions and I'm going so fast I hate to go so fast through them but in all of these visions</p>
<p>I and which kept pointing to an awakening taking place on the planet of the human species of the</p>
<p>entire species the consciousness of our universe was actually trying to awaken the entire human</p>
<p>species I was not shown how this was going to take place I was not shown how this was even possible</p>
<p>and then about a year and a half after the last of the visions of awakening I was given a session</p>
<p>right in the middle of the diamond luminosity work I had entered the diamond luminosity in sessions</p>
<p>45 and 50 I would enter it again later in sessions 60 and 66 right in the middle I was taken into the</p>
<p>deep time of our species I was given an experience of tape being taken right into the center of the</p>
<p>Great Awakening that we are coming into and there I experienced this transformation not as an</p>
<p>individual human being my boundaries had been opened so many times in the years preceding that</p>
<p>I experienced the Great Awakening as our species I was taken inside the collective psyche and was</p>
<p>given an experience of what will be happening from the perspective of the collective unconscious</p>
<p>my experience there was that for there to be a Great Awakening of this magnitude there must</p>
<p>first take place a great death a great surrender we must be purged and emptied of all our old</p>
<p>ways of thinking and feeling before the space is created to allow awakening of a higher order</p>
<p>of knowing so that the time of great awakening was preceded by a time of great breakdown loss of</p>
<p>control literally an unraveling of life as we know it just as in a psychedelic session one must let</p>
<p>go of everything and experience a profound death before great visions open likewise for our species</p>
<p>we must let go of everything that has dominated our past all the constrictions of our thinking the</p>
<p>constrictions of our mind and the constrictions of our heart in order to open to this new future</p>
<p>which is coming there is a third segment on the birth of the future human and that came later in</p>
<p>the chapter on the final vision I want to say that my visions didn't tell me how this was going to</p>
<p>take place they didn't tell me when it was going to take place and didn't give me any information</p>
<p>about the details it took me inside the collective psyche and gave me an experience of the collective</p>
<p>psyches experience of this and it also gave me an understanding and experience of some of the</p>
<p>mechanisms that are involved at the collective level that will help us move make this huge</p>
<p>transition we are trying to make in the little time that we have to make it I discussed this</p>
<p>I present this I discussed it in darknet early dawn and I lay it out again in LSD in the mind</p>
<p>of the universe the diamond luminosity material as I said before after the benediction of</p>
<p>blessings I had no idea where the work was going to go I was completely existentially</p>
<p>satisfied I had thought I had been drawn deep into the cosmic process I had been overwhelmed</p>
<p>with cosmic love I had been taken into the fertile void underneath all physical existence I had no</p>
<p>idea where things would go but there were still five years ahead on the journey and the diamond</p>
<p>luminosity kevlars four years of the work and 26 sessions it's by far covers more sessions than</p>
<p>any other chapter in the book and a longer period of time what happened was after going through yet</p>
<p>one more very intense death and rebirth process I was taken into a reality a level of consciousness</p>
<p>that was well Buddhism calls it dharmakaya the clear light of absolute love absolute reality</p>
<p>I was taken in a domain of consciousness that was absolute pure light the most striking thing</p>
<p>about the experience was how clear clear clear beyond imagination this domain was just to touch</p>
<p>this for a few minutes was life transforming in and of itself absolutely clear clear beyond the</p>
<p>species mind beyond archetypal reality beyond physical any derivative of physical consciousness</p>
<p>into this hyper clear celestial state over the next four years I entered this reality four</p>
<p>times and only four times out of 26 sessions only four of them took me deep into this reality</p>
<p>here are the names of the sessions death state diamond luminosity the universal field of light</p>
<p>in the nature of mind in between these sessions as you might imagine there were many sessions of</p>
<p>continuing intense purification because this was a deeper level of reality of much more pure level</p>
<p>of reality and that required the purification of my physical and psychological system in order</p>
<p>to stabilize consciousness at this reality they also scattered in these sessions it was a great</p>
<p>deal of personal healing that took place which is kind of curious to me because I would have thought</p>
<p>that personal healing would have taken place much earlier in the journey but it took place here and</p>
<p>I discussed I came to understand why things were unfolding in that order the first two of these</p>
<p>sessions were taking me deeper and deeper into Diamond luminosity which really piqued them in</p>
<p>the 50th session the second two session 60 and 66 the diamond luminosity was crunching itself</p>
<p>deeper and deeper into my physical system into my psychological system into my physical body as</p>
<p>I said talking about these sessions they're very powerful they draw me into them just to try</p>
<p>to describe that the time is short so I want to move through and we'll keep going and we can</p>
<p>come back to mend the question-and-answers let me mention one thing midway through this process</p>
<p>and the 50th session when I went into the deepest transcendent experience I ever had in any of</p>
<p>the sessions into the deepest level of diamond luminosity I was as far into the crystalline</p>
<p>body of God as I had ever been and would ever be and right in the middle of this session I</p>
<p>had an experience that completely changed my understanding of existence in the middle of this</p>
<p>session my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and I saw reality that was far beyond the reality that</p>
<p>I was in inside diamond luminosity and a ray of light came out of that distant reality and hit</p>
<p>me and it completely shattered it just I just absolutely shattered me and in that experience</p>
<p>I realized that there is no end to this journey there is no destiny point at end point that one</p>
<p>eventually reaches that the divine is infinite and will never ever I will never ever be able</p>
<p>to reach even using this powerful method to the absolute ends of that reality now this is</p>
<p>important because I had absorbed and many of us have absorbed the idea that there is an end</p>
<p>point to this journey you become one with God where you enter into the meta cosmic void that</p>
<p>there's an end point and you keep pushing until you reach that end point and I had experienced</p>
<p>oneness with God but I discovered that there are many permutations of oneness there are levels</p>
<p>and levels of oneness and I had experienced the the formless void but I had learned that there</p>
<p>are actually dimensions of formlessness there are depths of born lessness when I when the</p>
<p>diamond luminosity were opened I thought it came with such a profound sense of homecoming it</p>
<p>was so deeply satisfying I thought I had finally found my destination I finally found my stopping</p>
<p>point I had found the end of the journey in this session session fifty showed me that there are</p>
<p>dimensions beyond even that and I would never ever reach some final standpoint the reason the</p>
<p>death kept returning over and over again in this work is if you keep driving yourself and you have</p>
<p>a method that submission would powerful to keep taking you Pastor then limits the universe will</p>
<p>keep taking you deeper and deeper and deeper into yourself into itself and will never be able to</p>
<p>reach the very end of it and that's why I would be gentler with myself if I were doing this</p>
<p>work over again because now I understand that the goal was not to get to some end state or some</p>
<p>ultimate dimension the goal is to open ourselves to the trends ascendant realities and let us</p>
<p>much of that spiritual reality into our hearts and into our minds to let it change us down to the</p>
<p>heart and soul and incorporate as much of it as we possibly can and bring as much of divinity into</p>
<p>time and space as we possibly can and be patient with the rest I'm a little more patient now than</p>
<p>I was when I was a young man doing this work and then this brings me to the final addition</p>
<p>chapter the chapter where yeah I'm gonna take a shortcut here I'll simply say that I was put</p>
<p>through a horrendously powerful stripped-down process and was taken deeper into deep time than</p>
<p>I had ever been taken before and I was given an extraordinarily powerful series of visions about</p>
<p>human evolution and was allowed to experience again the future human that we are in the process</p>
<p>of becoming to experience the architecture the inner architecture of the deep psyche of the</p>
<p>future human and this is a magnificent being just to just to think about this being just to</p>
<p>remember the magnitude of this being brings tears to my eyes it's so important for us to hold on to</p>
<p>the vision of what we are where we are going and what is happening in the deep structure of history</p>
<p>because it's the shadows of our travail deep and as we enter the great time of unraveling as we</p>
<p>enter the purification that we are coming into now it's going to be very tempting and there'll</p>
<p>be all sorts of voices talking about Armageddon and apocalypse and the extinction and the end of</p>
<p>times and this is not the end of anything this is the process of giving birth to a new and finer</p>
<p>version of humanity after this the akancha sness guiding my sessions wrapped it up I didn't know</p>
<p>we were stopping but it wrapped it up and took me through two experiences which I called the goodbye</p>
<p>shion's it basically wrapped up all of our work and at the end of the 73rd session I knew that it</p>
<p>was time for me to stop I want to talk about very briefly coming off the mountain overall I think I</p>
<p>did a good job integrating my sessions as I went I paid a lot of attention to my body I took good</p>
<p>care of my body I did a lot of spiritual practice I wrote my sessions down carefully I tried to</p>
<p>internalize them as deeply as I could session by session I think I did a good job of integrating</p>
<p>my sessions and because I had been given so many gifts and so many blessings in the course of my 20</p>
<p>years of work I thought that I could simply stop my sessions and step back and I would continue</p>
<p>to be nourished by those experiences and I was and that did happen but that's not all that's</p>
<p>happened in the years following the ending of my work in 1999 I found myself gradually entering</p>
<p>into a period of what I call the deep sadness a profound existential sadness what I was suffering</p>
<p>from was a loss of communion with the divine I had entered so deeply into the divine so deeply</p>
<p>into the luminous reality of such supreme super cosmic reality that I knew I would never enter</p>
<p>that deeply into reality into the divinity again before I died I knew I was going away I was</p>
<p>setting it aside and coming back in it for a variety of reasons to much to go into here I had</p>
<p>to stop my sessions it was important for me to stop them but I knew I would never experience</p>
<p>the divine this deeply again until I died and I would experience it again well when I died</p>
<p>but not being able to return this deeply into divinity became an open heartache for me once</p>
<p>you have been have known the joy of dissolving into the divine light once you have dissolved</p>
<p>completely into the boundary list condition transcending time and space life on earth can</p>
<p>tend to feel kind of dried up and basically I was losing interest in continuing to live inside</p>
<p>time and space eventually I realized I was just waiting to die I was taking care of my children</p>
<p>I was taking care of my students and teaching writing but in my heart of hearts I was waiting</p>
<p>to die so that I could return to my beloved to the divine and then years passed and I realized this</p>
<p>is not right this is not the way it's supposed to be everything about my life was screaming</p>
<p>failure to integrate but because I had tried to integrate each of my sessions so carefully</p>
<p>and so conscientiously I did not understand work the failure could lie but I had no choice but to</p>
<p>recognize that somewhere along the line something had gone wrong that it would leave me feeling</p>
<p>so existentially adrift in its wake so I turned and studied my work further to try to figure</p>
<p>out what had gone wrong and what I learned was integrating an entire journey is different than</p>
<p>integrating individual sessions then basically hard to talk about in a matter</p>
<p>of seconds and a half a minute it's hard to describe the process of in a sense</p>
<p>having too much god it almost sounds like a contradiction in terms early more of God is always</p>
<p>better now this entire physical universe is the body of God I knew that I know that I'm standing</p>
<p>here and surrounded and part of the body of the divinity but even that knowledge which had been</p>
<p>given me in my sessions did not save me from the consequences but having entered into full divine</p>
<p>presence so many times in time I began to realize that I had lost a balance in my sessions and the</p>
<p>balance was between transcendence and imminence I had entered so deeply into transcendent reality</p>
<p>that I had lost my foothold in space-time reality transcendence is a magnificent thing it's</p>
<p>very healing to experience transcendence it's very it's very sane making it's very</p>
<p>teaches us what and why we're here but too much transcendence can be disorienting too much</p>
<p>transcendence can actually make you lose contact with another great truth and that is the truth</p>
<p>of our embodied existence I made a completely strong commitment to reestablishing my presence</p>
<p>inside time and space it took me about 10 years I did it through conscious exercises and I did</p>
<p>it through a sheer commitment to live as I was where I was for the my remaining years in this</p>
<p>earth and it took me about about 10 years to really get solidly grounded and operational on</p>
<p>the earth I will say at the same time that I've learned to manage my memories of transcendence</p>
<p>my memories of communion but they're always there in the back of my mind they always guide</p>
<p>me in the in the larger trajectory of my life yes hello thank you very much for sharing this</p>
<p>amazing appearance today you have a I made from Israel I wanted to ask two questions first of all</p>
<p>the about when you say a high dose what is what is the what are the doses that we were talking</p>
<p>about yeah yeah okay go ahead and the second question I wanted to ask about all this all the</p>
<p>setting you know what was the setting cause you know III consumed I do a lot work with with with</p>
<p>plants and I was very interesting to know about the setting how was the setting of the of the of</p>
<p>it of the of the journeys how you did it how you prepared yourself how you did what was in the</p>
<p>moment if you were sitting if you're lying you iced clothes music music nature although these</p>
<p>things and they I would like to know about this and about also about how you were in the daily</p>
<p>life what kind of things helped you to to stay here in a good way like what spiritual practices</p>
<p>or exercise of food or something that was thank you very much yeah good questions thank you I'm</p>
<p>worked at 500 to 600 micrograms which is very high doses of LSD and I mean low dose psychedelic</p>
<p>work maybe one two hundred micrograms this was very high levels my setting I was always working</p>
<p>in complete privacy and inside I was either in my own house or at my wife's professional office well</p>
<p>I was always lying down I was basically if you if you look at Stan's book LSD psychotherapy you'll</p>
<p>get the protocol laid out in great detail music was very carefully curated to pace the stages</p>
<p>of the opening and closing of the session always wearing eye shades not really and the only way of</p>
<p>my sitter would be in communication with me was primarily through the music she took care of my</p>
<p>body and took care of the music and so I was not in nature mm-hmm what was the other part of your</p>
<p>oath the grounding practices um really important you have to maintain grounding is a dynamic</p>
<p>balance my life was very kind of grounded in a schedule in reality first of all was grounded</p>
<p>in relationships was grounded in a long marriage my first wife 24-year marriage it was grounded</p>
<p>in my roles and responsibilities as a father I have three children so wherever I was on Monday</p>
<p>I was on Saturday I was back in the classroom on Monday and I was taking care of my children on</p>
<p>Sunday morning in my teaching a head of a rhythmic a constant set of responsibilities that kept me</p>
<p>always on track always kind of I always grounded in my responsibilities of teaching my students I</p>
<p>was always doing spiritual practice I was always doing a form of meditation I encorte did different</p>
<p>types of meditation over the years but I was always meditating took care of my body doing yoga</p>
<p>various physical practices it's really important to stay in lively contact with one's physical</p>
<p>world while doing this work so basically we're just blowing consciousness out to its farthest</p>
<p>limits and then it spontaneously Rican jails and I found that myself I had a seemingly a natural</p>
<p>capacity an easy capacity Jessica I can no doubt explain in my chart the markers of that yeah a</p>
<p>capacity to let loose and let go of boundaries and then to Rican Geel back into my time-space reality</p>
<p>yeah does that cover your questions enough yes yes thank you very much so I just left question is</p>
<p>to consume this you always made sure let's say there will be someone like in a distance on the</p>
<p>house or somewhere that it would need you need assistance or yeah like you always you make sure</p>
<p>that they nobody would be there yes in my is my mic on yes okay yes I was never left alone I was</p>
<p>always taking care of my wife was my sitter she's a clinical psychologist my first wife Carol she</p>
<p>was my sitter how she never left me alone and she she had complete responsibility for taking care</p>
<p>of our world we were always isolated we were in private there were no interruptions to my work</p>
<p>when I basically closed the door and we entered this world there was absolutely nothing that was</p>
<p>going to intrude from the outside world I think that's really important it's important to have an</p>
<p>absolute clear container I call it entering the Kiva just as in in the southwestern United States</p>
<p>when they would do spiritual practice they crawl into the Kiva a hole in the ground they pull up</p>
<p>the ladder and you're isolated completely from the world while you're doing this work if you're</p>
<p>going to go deep into the universes and very very important to have a completely grounded isolated</p>
<p>protected environment so that you know that whatever you're confronting and I've confronted</p>
<p>some pretty horrendously difficult experiences but whatever you're confronting you know that it's not</p>
<p>coming from outside you it's coming from innocence from inside you or from in it's coming from the</p>
<p>universe but purely through your own consciousness so no outside complications I did not try to</p>
<p>stay in contact with the outside world at all let's hear from Kari go ahead Kari thank you</p>
<p>so much for all your work I've heard you speak years ago through PCC and CIS and I've enjoyed</p>
<p>your writings and and many bits but I love this presentation that you did today so coherent and</p>
<p>walking through each of the stages and sessions and the way you organized the arc of the journey</p>
<p>is really impressive and super-rich so thank you so much for that thank you three questions you can</p>
<p>pick one if you want if it seems too but the the astrological integration I'm really curious about</p>
<p>you know your individual chart your transits how the individual chart kind of functioned as a</p>
<p>lens for you to entering these you know either subconscious parts of yourself to be able to see</p>
<p>them or the you know the collective unconscious as well all of the parts mmm there and and you know</p>
<p>how much of the of the chart do you think remained as you entered these less individuated states yeah</p>
<p>one the individual part two the transits any you know just any little head bits that stick out I</p>
<p>guess and then the third one I'm really curious particularly it came up for me when you were</p>
<p>talking about being in the ocean of suffering and the the healing that can come about from</p>
<p>processing that internally and individually and I'm curious if you if those effects you felt them</p>
<p>in your I'm just gonna call it your waking life your your normal states of consciousness in if</p>
<p>it kind of came back from people around you or in world events or you know any potent moments where</p>
<p>that where that you really felt that reflection of your internal experience from the external world</p>
<p>yeah let's start on your last question and then work forward into the earlier ones yeah it did</p>
<p>manifest there were manifestations that emerged in the outer world and so let me mention my book</p>
<p>the living classroom and there's a chapter on teaching and dark matter lead on what my I never</p>
<p>talked to my students about my work right I just made a firewall between my professional life and</p>
<p>my inner harmonic work and yet I found over time that various students were being activated by my</p>
<p>inner work though that the deeper I went the more powerful the activation became and it became such</p>
<p>a prominent part of my teaching that I found that I had to I had to understand what was going on</p>
<p>I had to learn how to work with these forces so for me integration doesn't mean simply personal</p>
<p>integration into my personal life but it also means helping take care of all the derivative</p>
<p>social fallout of one's own experiences I found for example that while I was teaching and I would</p>
<p>just be reaching to give examples of something I was trying to explain that the examples that I</p>
<p>would reach for would without my even being aware of it students were coming up after class and they</p>
<p>say you know that's interesting that you use that example because that's exactly what happened to</p>
<p>me this week and this happened over and over again that there was some kind of boundary which had</p>
<p>come down between my mind and my students mind it was and not only not only were these things</p>
<p>kind of like triggering sort of an aha moment from my students isn't that curious you know but</p>
<p>the deeper I went the more these synchronistic touches began to trigger very very deep healing</p>
<p>experiences in the students It was as if their souls were in communication with my soul and they</p>
<p>were giving me bits and pieces of insights into where they were what they needed where they were</p>
<p>suffering where they were hurting and this was happening without me being consciously aware of</p>
<p>the process at all and so I really had to study this I really had to understand what was what was</p>
<p>driving these processes and eventually I wrote after dark night early dawn I wrote an entire book</p>
<p>on the living classroom on the collective dynamics in the classroom and I don't mention psychedelics</p>
<p>there because this is not a psychedelic phenomena this is simply about the nature of consciousness</p>
<p>at one level we have private mind but just beneath our private mind mine does not have privacy</p>
<p>there are collective dimensions of mind it's like throwing a rock into a lake the ripples</p>
<p>spread out when you do deep deep work the ripples of that work spread out and touch the lives of</p>
<p>people around you the place where I experienced this most profoundly was in my classroom because</p>
<p>I was working in a collective context I could see these ripples coming back at me all the time the</p>
<p>first the issue of astrology and individual and global transits this is a complicated question</p>
<p>and I'm not an astrologer so I want to be very careful about this I tracked my sessions I used</p>
<p>astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from Rick tarnis about the correlations between outer</p>
<p>planets and inner experience in psychedelic days so I I plant my sessions by transits and I also</p>
<p>tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs projected against the pattern of the planets and I found it</p>
<p>to be a very complicated correlation while there were correlations between my individual transits</p>
<p>and global transits with the unfolding of my psychedelic experience there were also differences</p>
<p>that I wasn't expecting there was a kind of a failure to find correspondence for example my</p>
<p>breakthroughs were not always paired with with Uranus all right my my really really intense up</p>
<p>against the wall death in your face experiences were not a confident we're not marked by Saturn</p>
<p>transits or Saturn global transits or even Pluto transits and so it was a complicated process when</p>
<p>when my work began to go off the edge of time and space when I began to enter deeper and deeper into</p>
<p>archetypal reality and then beyond archetype of reality into dharmakaya or the diamond luminosity</p>
<p>I found what I felt was a kind of a roll-off of astrological variables that the astrology did not</p>
<p>seem my my psychedelic dance did not seem to map very easily into the astrological dance and I</p>
<p>began to think that there actually might be a roll off effect of one's solar dance and one's</p>
<p>session experiences and this continues to be an area of active dialogue for me it's an active</p>
<p>consideration there is an appendix in the book the last appendix is called pushing the limits of</p>
<p>astrological correspondence and in that chapter in that appendix I give the dates of all of my</p>
<p>sessions so if one wanted to one can look at my natal chart one could look at the sessions</p>
<p>when you look at the correlations or lack of correlations and so forth now I know that that's</p>
<p>not a this not enough sessions given in the book to really get a definitive answer but I wanted</p>
<p>to support the discussion of the relationship between astrology astrological transits and global</p>
<p>transits and one's own psychedelic work to me that's an open question at this point I know that</p>
<p>there are correlations particularly in the early stages of one works whether those correlations</p>
<p>continue to be as strong in the late stages of one's work I'm not as convinced I'm okay in terms</p>
<p>of my own chart that gets too complicated you know I have a lot of Neptune in my chart I have a lot</p>
<p>of water in my chart I have a Sun square Neptune with Neptune in the first house so there are a</p>
<p>lot of them I have some other dynamics that I was destined to do this type of work you know and</p>
<p>I want to mention the ocean of suffering this was not something that was forced on me I didn't</p>
<p>understand at the time but this and I don't think the universe forces any of us into this type</p>
<p>of work this was too too hard too demanding too difficult for it to have it before so I mean what</p>
<p>I learned over time again is it this is something that I voluntarily took on in this incarnation</p>
<p>it was part of the plan of my incarnation to do this work and to do the ocean of suffering work</p>
<p>in particular so I'm the volunteer and I think we're all when we get into this deep deep muck</p>
<p>that we get into we're volunteers for this work awesome thank you so much Pauline amber in Poland</p>
<p>and we are so happy to finally see you live and thank you wanted to say how much we appreciated</p>
<p>your call I have a few questions but let's start and let's continue the theme of the ocean of</p>
<p>suffering and where we live in Poland of course was the site of one of the most horrific events</p>
<p>that happened I would say for centuries which by which I mean of course the Holocaust yeah</p>
<p>when you had your experience of the ocean of suffering did you experience anything specific</p>
<p>or was the specific information or visions that you had that might have related to something</p>
<p>like this the reason I'm asking this question is because the event which happened 80 years ago</p>
<p>is so palpable that it's still in the atmosphere it's still in the collective you can feel it</p>
<p>here in the land and you know it's it's there in the collective for him whether we like it</p>
<p>or not and I was just interested in whether in any admissions you actually had a sense</p>
<p>of what happens then yeah I did not go into specifically identifiable historical traumas like</p>
<p>the Holocaust what happened was I basically was taken into deeper and deeper and deeper into pain</p>
<p>and fury and chaos and extraordinary suffering that kept getting larger and larger it wasn't</p>
<p>narrowly focused in any century or any country or any place it expanded to include hundreds of</p>
<p>thousands millions of people and it expanded to include hundreds of years thousands of years</p>
<p>until eventually my subjective experience was that it included all the human beings and all the</p>
<p>conflicts that emerged in the history of humanity I mean something of that scope so I have no doubt</p>
<p>that trauma like the Holocaust or trauma like the extinction of Native Americans and other tribal</p>
<p>conflicts and so on I have no doubt that those were implicitly present in what I was working</p>
<p>with but it it wasn't explicitly present it was like to me you know stan has this concept of</p>
<p>a coexistence system of condensed experience I think the collective psyche also has these</p>
<p>massive aggregate these balls of collective experience I call them the the meta matrices</p>
<p>they are they are the the meta coexistence the correct systems of the collective psyche that fuse</p>
<p>multiple historical periods and multiple cultures and multiple people's experience late in this</p>
<p>whole series it became very clear to me was that what I was engaging was memory a living memory of</p>
<p>trauma that was embedded in the collective psyche I should mention that where I live in Youngstown</p>
<p>Youngstown Ohio we haven't had a Holocaust here but we have a long history of violence it goes</p>
<p>back to the Native Americans and there were some massacres that took place here there is a</p>
<p>tremendous influx of Eastern European this is a town that made steel there's there's a lot of</p>
<p>old-world patriarchy a lot of violence against women a lot of old institutional violence and the</p>
<p>Mafia took over our town for decades they were gangland shootings in neighborhood parking lots</p>
<p>my sense is that because the ocean of suffering was on the agenda in my work that I was actually</p>
<p>brought to a place where these poisons run close to the surface in the collective psyche and</p>
<p>I'm sure that if I were working in Poland or in a place that it would have been more explicit</p>
<p>the historical trauma that you're referring to thank you thank you first of all Chris thanks so</p>
<p>much for all your work over the the decades been a huge fan forever and ever and ever and I'm just</p>
<p>so wonderful and on this ocean of suffering issue that's been brought up and touched on because</p>
<p>that's kind of like the next stop on the journey for a lot of the people out there working your</p>
<p>book dark night early dawn was extremely helpful to patron i we we don't work with LSD we work</p>
<p>with holotropic breathwork which is just another technique in order to connect with these things</p>
<p>and what we had noticed over the years was that there were individuals who under not predictable</p>
<p>circumstances began to contact what seemed to be this ocean of suffering it wasn't a past life</p>
<p>which happens often enough but there was thinking about it and then we realized my goodness people</p>
<p>need some clarity that this is not just a personal stuff that they're saddled with and have to carry</p>
<p>around forever they are in a sense volunteers yes and so this was extremely useful and some people</p>
<p>in spiritual emergency that come to us begins realized oh so I was trying to solve the basic</p>
<p>problem between men and women for the last five thousand years okay well you know I've got other</p>
<p>things I've got to do today and so that I want to thank you very much for that and it's clear now</p>
<p>how this network will make more available to many more people whatever techniques to work at even</p>
<p>with spontaneous experiences and what we developed was using systemic constellation work then to do a</p>
<p>constellation for the individual that is caught in this that would say okay here's the representative</p>
<p>for the part of the man woman's story that's mine and here's a representative for the part of the</p>
<p>man woman's story that hmm you know that's a great big thing and then to let this this clarity Wow</p>
<p>I do have work to do we all have work to do and there's something else going on yeah and and so</p>
<p>I just want to thank you for the earlier work I'm so glad to see this thank all the powers that</p>
<p>living breathing so I'm looking forward to the stage and our workshops in which the the comments</p>
<p>about the other other stages of the past becomes thank you I I completely agree and I think as</p>
<p>we go deeper into this historical crisis that we've entered I think we're entering into a</p>
<p>collective dark night of the soul it seems like there's a profound detoxification taking</p>
<p>place that the poisons of history are coming out of our collective pores maybe we see it if we</p>
<p>look around us in body politic but it's coming out of our pores and it's coming up underneath</p>
<p>us and flooding so that if we're interested in doing purifying work if we're interested in</p>
<p>doing transformational work when we open we open it if we have a technique that's powerful</p>
<p>enough like holotropic breathwork we open at an individual level and then we open at these</p>
<p>deeper levels now I'm not a therapist but if I were a therapist and if I were working with</p>
<p>people entering these states I think just what you're describing differentiating different</p>
<p>levels of the work that emerges recognizing kind of what is mine personally and what is</p>
<p>not mine personally but mine collectively it's important to have closure and to be able to</p>
<p>close these collective levels and there would be I would think an importance of kind of widening</p>
<p>those sessions down and kind of concretizing the collective work in contrast and separate from</p>
<p>one's individual work now I will say that I went into this work voluntarily I stayed into</p>
<p>it voluntarily and I am infinitely glad for just personal reasons let alone the collective</p>
<p>reasons I am personally very glad to have done this work because the rewards that came were</p>
<p>not simply a karmic paying back but when one opens and embraces one's life as a member of the</p>
<p>species when one's open to the species and takes responsibility for the pain and suffering of the</p>
<p>species it sets in motion not only a healing of that species but there is a tremendous infusion</p>
<p>of light that enters into the collective psyche and into your psyche as it enters into the</p>
<p>collective psyche and so I have been so deeply rewarded more than amply compensated for the</p>
<p>work that I did in the ocean of suffering and other levels and I think that this is true for</p>
<p>other people too that when we give deeply and generously to those around us sooner or later</p>
<p>we don't know when how or where but sooner or later there is a deep fruition that comes up</p>
<p>underneath us that carries us individually where the universe is intent on carrying the</p>
<p>human species as a collective and that is into this birth of this profoundly new quality of</p>
<p>consciousness that I'm calling the diamond soul or the future human thank you so much Chris</p>
<p>as Kerry said that was such a beautifully laid out coherent arc and I'm so April for the time</p>
<p>that you have spent with us today and for all of you here connecting from all around the world</p>
<p>thank you so much for uniting today in both our hearts and our minds and we send each of you so</p>
<p>much love and infinite blessings on your journey as you deepen into your own explorations</p>
<p>and the healings that we're all here doing right now today in this world thank you so</p>
<p>much be well and we will see you next time</p>

to adventures through the mind I am your host as always James W gesso I am going to start this episode off with a big thanks to the spirit plant medicine conference in Vancouver happening November 2nd to the 4th you've probably noticed they've caused sponsored a few episodes over the last couple months and yeah that's very exciting the guest today Chris Bates is one of the presenters at the conference and I will be one of the attendees so if you want to come check me out or check out the conference in general or come check out Chris at that conference follow the link contained in the description to this episode jump over there if you buy a ticket then I get a little bit of commission from that which goes towards my costs to fly out to Vancouver to attend this so it's and you get to go to a big concert or a concert Jesus conference yes win win okay today's guest is Christopher M beige beige is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years he has also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of integral studies and a fellow at the Institute of noetic Sciences an award-winning teacher and international speaker Chris's work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness especially psychedelic states he's written three books translated into six languages life cycles a study of reincarnation in light of contemporary consciousness research dark night early dawn a pioneering work into psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness and the living classroom an exploration of teaching and collective fields of consciousness he has a new book being released from inner traditions in 2019 diamonds from heaven a 20-year journey into the mind of the universe so let me just give you a little bit more detail as to Christopher and he's been up to you at some point about 40 years ago he decided it would be a good idea for him to take high doses of LSD regularly with the intention I guess to map consciousness as a metaphysical philosopher and then proceeded to do so 76 I believe 76 times over the course of 20 years 20 years after his last journey in that specific structure he is about to release his book diamonds from heaven and he is on the show today to talk about basically what drove him to do this what it was like and what did he learn and furthermore not just what did he learn about the nature of consciousness and the psychedelic experience but what did he learn about what can we do as human beings to make sense of experiences that are as massive as the ones you were going to hear him describe in this episode we also had a great post-credits talk that with his permission I am going to be releasing as well

chance to really look into what you do until yesterday other than you know Stephens you know what's the word I'm looking for shining recommendation definitely put you in the map and then I was I was really blown away I found I found it to be yeah that's just really blown away it's interesting yeah interesting stuff you had going on there yeah well I've been sawed up on the side of the psychedelic community but been there for a long time doing my own thing mm-hmm-hmm yeah makes sense cuz you had to protect your your career for some time yeah yeah alright so okay why don't why don't we start it off here just easing in give me a sense of where you're coming from when you start this work you were doing high dose LSD experiences for twenty years you've stopped about ten years ago which means that you started doing this thirty thirty years ago at that point I believe LSD was already illegal can you sort of like draw or paint us a picture of the context that you were entering in to the decision to do this and while while doing that can you also explain the difference between what you were doing and what was popular at the time insofar as psychedelic therapy or psycholytic therapy yeah well I came out of graduate school in 1978 I was trained as a philosopher religion and I came to Youngstown State University in Northeast Ohio to begin my teaching career and at the time I was an atheistic Lee inclined agnostic but that first year I read Stan Grof first book realms of the human unconscious and I am immediately connected with it I felt I had found my life's work this was 1978 the Controlled Substances Act had been passed in 1970 the early era of psychedelic research was over and of course we were had entered that blackout between 1970 and when Scientific American had published its front-page editorial recommending that we end the ban on psychedelic research in 2017 2014 but there was this blackout no one was allowed to do this work anymore I was convinced that it could be done safely and Stan Graz was very work was very important me in that respect and I was convinced that the people who would be making the most important contributions in philosophy of religion would soon be being people who were riding out of an experiential basis so I made the decision to divide my life in half and my public life I continued my work as a academic professor traditional professor teaching my courses doing all the things professors do but in my private life have began a 20-year journey working with high levels of psychedelics of LSD seventy three sessions extending over 20 years between 1979 and 1999 I chose to work with high doses first because it was complicated to arrange time for sessions when you have a dual career marriage and two professional people and I wanted to make the most out of every session but then after the process got started I found that I thought it would get me to my goal of enlightenment faster basically breaking off larger pieces of karma doing a larger pieces of karma in every session after that model of personal enlightenment dissolved along the way I continued to work with high doses of LSD because it took me where I wanted to go and then it took me farther than I ever dreamed was possible you know just gonna take a quick pause to clarify something because high-dose LSD is not very clear for the listeners how high of a dose what was the what was the metric no no metric was 500 to 600 micrograms which is kind of a maximum high dose stands worked if Stan differentiates between psycholytic or low dose therapy averaging about 200 micrograms up to 300 psychedelic therapy is high dose between 300 and 1500 more typically 300 to 500 but in the early work that he did at Spring Grove Hospital it was deliberately limited to a maximum of 3 sessions the idea was to trigger an experience of transcendence that would help people come to terms with their impending death I thought if you could do this safely three times you could do it safely more frequently and that's so I saw myself at the time simply doing an extended dose of high-dose therapy when I got to the end of this journey however and was looking back I realized that what unfolded on this journey was more radical and more challenging than what had emerged in the early psychedelic therapy work and so I had to coin a new term a new phrase for it so the way I would describe my work now that that psychedelic period is psychedelic exploration the method is psychedelic therapy with totally internalized sessions strong evocative music working with the sitter always in a protected isolated environment classic set and setting the difference is the high number of sessions so for me turned out to be 73 sessions some of the conclusions that you that you drew are I just remember having recently listened to some of your lectures and and and just being so moved by it and I'm noticing myself now wanting excitedly to ask you basically what you learned in the end but I know that this I'm just like kind of suppressing that urge a little bit and to maybe deepen into you know what what exactly was happening what and and I want to ask that question couched and very specific phenomena that you observed which was multiple layers of death and and rebirth and like an increasing expansion into and I'm kind of I guess using my own my own words here but like of higher levels of reality can you sort of couch in this idea of what do you mean by multiple death and rebirth can you give us an outline of I mean what the hell was happening in there after 70 something you know progressively through 70 something sessions about 500 mics of LSD well that is the question and it is it's it's it's hard to summarize I mean it's taken me about 300 pages just to tell the story of what happened it's hard to jump into it quickly because there were so many layers but basically my experience has been that the universe or the mind of the universe of the mind of divine is an infinite ocean of potential and when we drop our individual mind into that ocean it catalyzes a set of experiences out of that infinite potential and as we are changed and and influenced and healed and purified by that exchange the seed crystal of our mind changes and then later when we drop that same mind now transformed into the ocean it catalyzes a deeper set of experiences out of that infinite potential so my experience was that there were a series of initiations that took place over many years a series of deaths followed by a rebirth into a deeper level of reality and then a gradually acclimating to that level of reality adjusting to its conditions you're going through a purification process because as I experienced at least every deeper level of reality or every deeper state of consciousness that gave us access to a deeper level of reality was a higher level of energy so to stabilize consciousness at that deeper level of consciousness so that your experience of that deeper level of reality would be coherent and not fragmented you had to go through a very intense purification process but if you continue to work at a particular level if you can continue to stay internalized and push my experience was you would go back to the same level and you would I would acclimate to that level I would begin to have more coherent experiences at that level and eventually I would come to a point where the death rebirth process would repeat itself I would go through some agonizing complete loss of control and then I would collapse and be an internal collapse and then I would be reborn into a yet deeper level of consciousness which gave me access to a deeper level of reality and this went on systematically periodically for twenty years so to describe the levels of consciousness that I entered into it's a it's a longer story absolutely yeah and I was thinking at some point I might ask you a couple like what does this mean insofar as like why is the chapter titled this and yeah but maybe because all of this you know having listened to the longer story you know all of this is very descriptive but for someone who's just entering into this for the first time it can be kind of abstract so now maybe you can you can talk about what this looks like because you know I got one description from you that seemed to make a lot of sense to me which was something like you know in the early sessions you were working through your own personal stuff and that eventually you needed to die to who you were to become you know you know beyond your personality into a greater a greater sense of like the underlying human consciousness and then even at some point to die from that underlying human consciousness into something beyond it can you give maybe a step by step in the early stages what that looked like yeah for about the first two years I worked at what Stan Grof describes as the perinatal level of consciousness which is the interface between your personal reality your egoic reality in space-time and early transpersonal consciousness so I went through many experiences of reliving my own birth of experiences of death and dying until eventually after about two and a half years my personal reality was just shattered I was just crushed and extinguished I died as the person I had known myself to be and then I was reborn into a level of reality that transcended radically transcended Kris Bhatia's reality and I was working at that point at a deep within the collective unconscious and then the the entire process began again and in my experience there are two phases of every session there's a cleansing phase which lasts usually a couple of hours and then there's an ecstatic phase so if you enter into the cleansing phase and let it take you wherever it wants to take you you reach it reaches a peak you go through some type of crisis some type of transition and then the remainder of the session is spent in ecstatic reality word receive teachings and experiences so in the cleansing phase of Phase two I entered into what I call the ocean of suffering just domains of pain and suffering that were vast and kompis large swathes of human history and hundreds of thousands of persons it took about two years to go through all of that material at the personal side on the ecstatic side I was experiencing for about a year I experienced my life as a completed whole start to finish all the time moments of my life as a simultaneous present I just kind of experienced my life as a complete totality and then in the second phase I went through a series of initiations in which I was taken deep into the mind of the universe and just given a series of teachings and given a series of experiences that basically grounded me in a larger cosmological vision of reality after about two years of that process I went to another death and rebirth cycle and was spun beyond not only beyond my individual reality but also beyond my reality as a human species altogether beyond the collective psyche into what I done is archetypal reality but it wasn't the archetypes described by either plate or Carl Jung it was both I mean it had certain features similar to plato's description and certain features of Jung's description but it really had other features that did not fit in their description the realities that I encountered there at the high archetypal level were not eternal unchanging ideas in the mind of God as Plato describes it but vast living cosmic forces giant beings being so vast my mind literally could not wrap itself around it I could only get approximations of the scale of their dimensions at the slightly beneath that at the Union level I entered deep into the collective psyche and then first a couple of years had all sorts of experiences of how our species functions as a single organism was taken deep into the sort of meta neural networks of the species mind and also began to have experiences of reincarnation but not as an individual not from the perspective of individual souls but from the spective of an entire species that was incarnated every generation a whole generation of its beings and experiencing the centralized intelligence that was kind of orchestrating or collaborating with the individual souls to facilitate not just an individual journey of transformation but to facilitate a species journey of transformation and I went through another round of death and rebirth I'm skipping over and of course a lot of things right right and then I was catapulted into what some people call causal reality into non dual reality in where the entire universe began to function as a single totality and had a number of experiences of what the Buddhists call Shunyata emptiness of self oneness cosmic love experiences of the primal void the fertile void you know the armless that is a source of all existence after that then I went I was coming into the last five years of work in the last five years catapulted me after again more rounds of purification and death and rebirth into a cosmic light that was so intense and so clear and so pure I called it the diamond luminosity and that's where the title of the book comes from diamonds from heaven buddhism calls this the absolute clear light it associates it with its concept of dharmakaya the fundamental reality that is the source of all existence let me back up light entered into the experiences there are many many levels of light many gradations of light in my experience there I had experienced light many times and earlier death rebirth processes so when I talk about the diamond light I'm not simply talking using metaphor to describe that light I'm trying to describe a particularly intense exceptionally clear state of awareness of crystalline light that becomes so clear eventually becomes transparent to itself and in those last five years in the last 26 sessions which was actually about one third of all of my work I entered that reality four times in just four times so about once a year I would be catapulted into this reality and then I would go through more detoxification more purification and about a year later would enter into this reality one more time that's the kind of larger overview right right good and of God that you stopped there because there's some your your closing experiences I want to get to near the end but I want to maybe jump back a little bit and focus on what you're talking about here with this purification and also with this idea of becoming more coherent now when you say purification what exactly do you mean because I my idiot assumption is something akin to you know what the ayahuasca culture calls purging where you're basically putting pushing out or releasing or letting go or discharging suffering pain you know hardships whatever through the active metabolic process of feeling them yeah so that you can having let those go enter into a state that a state of being that exists without them is is that what you mean when you're saying purification it's a good description it is that it's physiological I mean you know people throw up a lot on Maya Wasco they don't tend to think of LSD is something that causes throwing up but to me I was working with such high levels I threw a blot on Elysee that's part of this whole releasing of physical toxins biochemical toxins psychological toxins just letting them come through your system and offload and very rapid sequences when you move into deeper levels it takes different forms I mean to sort of it if you want to become to enter it to enter into very very deep states of consciousness where you enter into unit of consciousness with the divine our different dimensions of existence or different dimensions of the cosmos you have to completely let go of everything in your life which keeps you small so it's not just negative experiences it's not just pain it's every thought form every emotional derivative that consulates around smallness but you you have to sort of allow your system to step up to handle the enormous waves of energy that move through you in these very deep states of consciousness so purification begins at the personal level your purifying all sorts of pieces of your personal history including your former life history but as you go deeper and deeper the forms of purification become harder to identify with anything personal it come and eventually you literally are transcending time and space and there is a sense in which you you have to empty yourself of everything associated with your entire history of being time and space being to enter into realities beyond time and space hmm but it is exactly as the ayahuasca the Sun to die may tradition describes it it is a Porta God it's a letting go it's a manifesting and letting go of those realities hmm I'm you know given that we're talking about transcending time and space I'm gonna assume that it you know it's a trend transcends linguistic form as well but I'm just curious like what what does it feel like yeah - I like I know what it feels like to you know purify or discharge sadness yeah I know what it feels like to to feel like the grief and the fear you know particularly the the grief of letting go of who I think I am yeah or who I thought I was yeah but it really it's it's mind-blowing really is there a way that you could describe in language what it's like to purify let go of your very essence of being bound by time and space well your question really penetrates right to the some very heart of some very thorny issues let me let me mention before we jump into it you know ineffability is taken as one of the signature qualities of a genuine mystical experience William James first brought it in and it's been incorporated into some of the diagnostic questionnaires to assess the the depth of one's mystical experience personally I think ineffability is overrated so these things are hard to put into words they are hard to to find ways of expressing experiences that you enter into in these realities but my experience is when you first break into a new level of reality it is hard to get it down on paper it is hard to find words and there are some tricks that I learned in order to conquer ties by recall of these experiences but what I found is if you keep going back to the same level of reality over and over again if you go through this purification process and consciousness stabilizes at that level of reality your cognition becomes clear you begin to understand how this works the pieces begin to go here and it becomes easier and easier to find the right words to describe it then when you break into a new level of reality the same dynamic repeats itself that you're kind of overwhelmed by the enormity of something different but if you keep going back with focus you will be able to stabilize it the particular experience that you're talking about of letting go all of your experience in time and space well partly partly I experienced it as a as a matter of fear you're becoming something so large that it's swallowing everything you've ever known not only swallowing everything you've ever known as an individual but there's a sense in which when you're working at that level even - even to push that particular boundary you are no longer an individual having gotten to that level because a sense in which your you're functioning as a species you're functioning as a it's a fractal member of an entire human species and then at a deeper level you're not even a species you're somehow a fractal embodiment of an entire evolutionary impulse has been manifesting galaxies and solar systems and planets and evolving life so you literally have already dissolved into those deeper patterns so you're not an individual having a transpersonal experience you have surrendered into that part of the universe that lives a sea galaxy that lives effort as an evolutionary thrust so when it comes to the point of letting go of that and entering into something which is we're the big bang came from entering the domain of formlessness itself it's it feels less like a personal crisis it feels like an almost an evolutionary crisis or a species anxiety but if you let go the universe takes you in and can you just lose all frames of reference and then suddenly you're alive within a different reality I mean what you it's hard to describe because I say you're alive but you're not who you were before but there is a threat of memory that connects who you were inside time and space to who you are in this reality which is outside time and space but what you are experiencing it's not you're literally adrift in the mind of God so to speak you're you're you're in the in the cosmos as part of the tidal currents of the cosmos hmm like part of but also as the tidal currents like there is there like it's not just like oh I am in the universe as there like a sense of being all of that as well yes I mean basically in each deeper and deeper level I experience it as a remembering I wasn't entering a reality that I was not I was remembering a dimension of my own existence that I had forgotten about so becoming one with God is not a matter of confronting an external deity which you then merge with becoming one with God or I don't even like to use the word God because of all the you know historical associations the baggage that comes with it but to become one with that reality with that fundamental reality you it's a matter of remembering it's a remembering the fundamental truth that that's what you are you are a manifestation you are a fractal embodiment of an aspect of this divine impulse so the whole experiences as you become larger you remember more as you remember more you become clearer as you become clearer you enter deeper and deeper into into these ocean currents but always a sense of waking up you're waking up it's not really about dying and being reborn it's just a matter of waking up to something that is your true and natural condition so I might I might be jumping the gun here as they say but I feel like this might be a good time to ask something that I wanted to save till later and then I'll jump back afterwards okay I'm I'm assuming that you're familiar with with the the anecdotal reports of five Meo DMT that have been really growing a lot over the last 10 years or so yeah and a lot of the people who are will say the people of the five you know they they experience and then claim that what happens is like this is the ultimate non-dual experience and you enter into you become like the apex of consciousness in some way like God and in your experience you at one point even got to what could be described as as apex maybe this this is this diamond luminosity and then at some point realized that there was something even further beyond that as well I'm curious given your experiences like your you know we were deep experiences with a high dose LSD over such a long time and and these this these entrances and into different levels of consciousness how do you feel about the sort of the larger cosmological or metaphysical claim that's being made by people who are experiencing five Meo DMT yeah first I'm really comfortable with the five Meo DMT discussion I mean I think it's a fascinating substance it has this capacity to this catapult us through so many layers and give us a short immersion into those deep deep cosmic territories but in some ways the situation is similar I think to people who have near episodes you know we're just walking down the street they have a heart attack and they they they almost died and they're knocked out of their body and they have a powerful transcendental experience which lasts minutes hours and then they come back in their body and they're trying to understand what it is they experienced and if you have fleeting contact with these realities at one level you know what they are you can feel what they are you know there is a sense in which you are immersed in the ultimate but it may be because they are so short term and so singular I think sometimes we draw premature conclusions about what they imply for the nature of the universe itself so at least here's why I suspect that when I was doing this work and I got to the point where I was in those last five years and I was in that series of immersions into what I call the diamond luminosity past oneness past you know merging with the divine into some level that felt even beyond call so reality I'd gone into it once I went into it a second time this is my 50th session and then towards the end of that session I had an unusual experience I was as as far out as I ever gone I was totally absolutely peace floating merged with this light and then suddenly everything pivoted 90 degrees and I saw a reality that was far far removed and this reality was light soaked and a beam of light came out of that reality and hit me and it just absolutely shattered me it was a completely different order of light beyond even the diamond luminosity that it had taken me 15 years to get to and that's when I realized I called it the absolute light just to give it a name but that's when I realized that it's an infinite progression and I completely gave up the idea that we could ever get to the end of it let's see when I had started this work I thought there was an end state you did this work and you reach some definitive end of the process and some people talked about is becoming one with God or becoming one with the universe some people talked about entering the primal void of the super meta cosmic void and I had entered those states of oneness and I discovered that there are actually many gradations of oneness and I had entered formlessness but I discovered that there are actually gradations of harmlessness and this experience convinced me that even using this very powerful method the universe was just much much larger than I had imagined it to be and that there was no way I was going to ever be able to come to the end some end and I just realized that was a false a false expectation on my part and then what happened in the sessions is that the session stopped taking me farther out and the diamond luminosity began to crunch itself deeper more and more deeply into my physical body the next year two years of work were all about being having that diamond light crunch into my physiology into my psychology into my neural Anatomy so I understand I really do understand those senses of ultimate see that emerge in these experiences I think that's a phenomenologically accurate description but kind of as a meta physician I would bracket discussions of Ultima C because I'm not I really not sure that we are in a position as a species even using these very very powerful substances to make safe claims about what is ultimate or not yes cool thank you very much now we're gonna put a pin in that and jump back again and talk a little bit more about purification and coherency you make a comment you've made it the comment multiple times and maybe you could just sort of clarify it a bit now that you you have to effort at some point and get familiar with certain states of consciousness at which point you become coherent they're your you hold a coherent cognition while in these higher energy states of consciousness can you maybe just explain that a little bit more deeper and possibly you know how how it is that you do that yeah well this was a learn as you go process you know I didn't I wasn't part of the psychedelic culture I didn't have a shaman kind of helping me through this process I was really having to figure it out as I went and I was using a medicine that didn't have a lot of history you know I didn't have and it didn't have psychedelic didn't have fields associated with it the way that mushrooms do and the way that ayahuasca does it's really relatively new medicine and therefore it's very much was taking me to an edge my experience you know when I read the picture of people's psychedelic experiences particularly their experiences with with LSD or other very powerful psychedelics I saw that the the different ways that they were touching all sorts of different levels of reality but I also saw a lot of confusion and a lot of fragmentation in their experience they were getting it was as if they were getting bits and pieces and I found that when I when they were describing multiple sessions it was as if they were always starting over again they were they were always getting to this space where they were having these experiences but there wasn't a progressive developmental sequence my experience was different than that I experienced myself as being engaged in a long sustained conversation which deepened into a communion with a consciousness which never took any form it never took a particular symbolic form it never but it always was there and it was orchestrating my sessions it was determining what happened in the sessions all I had to do is show up let it take me where it would take me and then make sense of what would happen in making sense of what happened involved methodically during the session thinking about it extensively after the session it wasn't simply just a matter of having a clean context environment so a good set good setting good preparation all those things it was a matter of thoroughly thinking about processing trying to integrate intellectually as well as personally emotionally and physically the experiences that you were having so I mean I was trained as a philosopher and I was trained as an analytic philosophy philosopher so when I would enter these states I would try to enter into it as clearly as I could and take in as much as I possibly could and understand as much as I could and retain as much as I could and I found that if you meet the universe or if you meet these states with that kind of devotion to engagement it will orchestrate your experience and take you as deep as you have the capacity to go but you have to hold the posture at your end you have to do your work you have to do your side and your side for me involved paying attention surrendering having the courage to let it take me where it would take me having the courage to die again and again in this process but then writing it down thinking about it trying to figure it out put the pieces all together and let it unfold hmm interesting yeah yeah that but that's great and later before we end I'd like to ask you a bit about your your thoughts and advice on integration but what you having said that and when I first heard it really it echoed something that I hadn't been able to give words to before I died I wrote a book on working with psilocybin mushrooms and that is exactly what happened to me over the course of an extended period of time of using it monthly it was like each time I used it I got with this like pay attention surrender and trust the process I just got a greater level of cognitive coherency so that I could come back I would know all the writing I explore it that I could you know accurately articulate this is exactly what's happening and here's how it comes about and here's well for me anyways at these dose levels so that wasn't really that's a really cool language and unless you want to particularly comment on that I have a have another question here for you now I completely understand your app are it's interesting how our experiences are so congruent with different psychedelics each psychedelic has its own quality but the the phenomenon of engagement is the same in all of them mmm you definitely went much much deeper than I much deeper than I did actually let's just let's okay we're gonna just put everything on hold for a second because you said something else one time that I thought was very interesting and I'll just ask you outright because I get this question of law a lot what is the difference between LSD and psilocybin yeah well I mean this phenomenologically not yeah it's not magical it I think of psilocybin as very much of a kind of a body grounded psychedelic I feel it very strongly in my body it really when I'm in a psilocybin state this intelligence it almost as if it enters into my body it sweeps through my body checks it out can identify what's going on here there touches the emotional feels and it's a very it's my whole body hums and glows when I'm with psilocybin something very similar with ayahuasca it's it feels very you're it takes your whole body into the experience my experience working again with high doses of LSD ins different lower doses but with high doses of LSD it is such an enormous acceleration such an enormous catapulting into deep deep states of consciousness it almost as if this isn't really quite true but in certain ways that almost as if it tends to leave the body behind and there's a way in which integrating the body into those states of consciousness takes time and comes later there's a tendency to that's not a dissociative is psychedelic like ketamine is but it tends to sort of drive to what I would call the high cosmological ceiling it tends to throw you into the high cosmological ceiling and it doesn't give you for example in least in my experience it didn't give me contact with the elemental spirits with the earth spirits with the with the the totem ancestors of the animal or vegetable kingdom it just wasn't working at that level tends to be kind of drive towards the cosmological ceiling so to speak so it would drive me beyond my personal ego and then it drove me into the species consciousness and then it drove me into earth consciousness and then it started taking me even beyond that territory cool I thank you I found later that using psilocybin actually kind of helped me integrate some of my LSD experiences precisely because it tended to open up my body and allowed some of that high cosmological energy to enter more easily into my physical form now what are you taking were you taking higher doses of psilocybin or more average say five dried grams of mushrooms or were you entering into Kalindi Iggy territory where you're at 2030 grams 40 50 grams of mushrooms I was probably working in more standardized doses with psilocybin I wasn't really trying and and much of the work I did with psilocybin was after I had stopped the LSD work I did some intermittently along the way but after I stopped the LSD work I worked with psilocybin and some with ayahuasca and I what I found is that it was very helpful towards integration I didn't feel like I was breaking new territory and I wasn't trying to break new territory I was trying to recover from the territory had already broken into I was trying to basically learn how to walk on the earth again after having so many transcendental experiences hmm well I would be very curious to see you and I Kalinda compare notes of ultra high dose trip to max but let's let's yeah that's let's go back now that we're okay we've explored that okay increasing you know cognitive coherency at increasing levels of high energy consciousness mixing this with purification okay so what are you curious about like did it get easier or did it stay about the same as you progressed and what I mean by this was is okay so in the early phases you're just you're struggling with all the pain and grief of just letting go of being a you know a white you know highly educated philosopher a male you this is one of your stories into becoming something else you know like the entire female side of our species you know over time yeah you're struggling with that the pain and grief of that maybe pain and grief of past traumas or whatever it is and then you know fast forward 15 years and you're you're you're facing the fear and the discomfort and the challenge of letting go of all time and space and somewhere in the middle of that you're in a you would you go the the sea of suffering you know what you're experiencing the suffering of the entire species of humanity you know overall time simultaneously you know yeah is is what you were experiencing in those later phases was that about the same level of challenge with a greater psychic magnitude or did it get easier did it stay this this is what I'm curious about really yeah yeah um the ocean of suffering was much harder much more demanding to experience than the dissolution of my private ego is different a different order of magnitude let me I have to go back to think of something I thought while you were asking the question I'm beginning to lose it now okay I don't I want to be careful not to over emphasize the negative because there's a steady rhythm you know there is he the clerk the the purification phase of a session and then there the ecstatic phase and to me the only thing it makes it possible to endure the purification phase are the blessings that you're giving in the ecstatic phase so when I was processing the ocean of suffering after a session it wasn't just the ocean of suffering that I was processing I was also processing the enormous gift of my early unit of experiences my early experiences of being taken on what I call a cosmic tour my early experience of being taken back to the beginning of creation so it's it's all sorts of wonderful ecstatic experiences are part of that and this rhythm kept up all the way through there was a rhythm of purification and the rhythm of blessing and the blessings always kept pace with the magnitude and the scale of the purification so the deeper the purification went the deeper the blessings became until eventually once you learn that rhythm once you learn that all you have to do is follow the purification as deeply as it goes and there will be blessings waiting for you at the end at that point you literally begin to not avoid purification you seek it out you want to go as deeply into that muck as you can not because you're a glutton for pain and suffering you're you're a glutton for what lies on the other side of that pain and suffering now in some ways the rhythm itself gets easier once you know that that's the rhythm one it gets easier because there's less fear associated with it the ordeal may be intense but it doesn't frighten you as deeply you may get transiently terrified but you trust the process you keep going deeper into it one of the worst in in the sense experientially most demanding accessions I ever had actually was the 70th session it was the last great vision I would give in a series of what would call the great visions and might work over the years but the 70th session put me through a tear down I ripped down that was worse than anything I'd ever gone through before so it in some ways it gets easier but then if the universe wants to take you very very deep in order to get to that depth it's got to put you through a process that you need in order to stabilize consciousness and that depth and in this case it took me deeper into what I call deep time than it had ever taken me before I use I coined the term deep time to describe a particular experience with respect to time and transcending time you can go outside of time altogether into eternity it and escape the envelope of space-time altogether but I had many experiences of experiencing certain units of time certain spans of time as an organic whole so this began early on by experiencing my complete life as a totality start to finish and then I began to experience evolution the evolution of the universe and the evolution of humanity in terms of a timeframe of tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of years so there was like my consciousness was extended to a hundred thousand years and I could experience how the universe experiences that hundred thousand years not how Chris based might experience that so deep time became a term that I use to describe different modalities of time and eventually I became convinced that these modalities weren't simply projections and they weren't simply you know playing shuffling the cards about chris bosh experiences time but somehow I was being taken into how the universe experiences time and the universe as you move more towards the edge of space-time time itself begins to be more porous this last session let me back up one of the things we haven't talked about yet is many experiences that I had which eventually became a story of the evolution of the human race and where we are in our evolutionary story and the particular crisis that we are coming into as I think our entire species is trying to go outgrow the go excite all of the past and move into a much deeper archetypal know a much deeper experience of being a human which is much more soul oriented much more transparent to each other into the divine the 70th session that I referenced was my deepest excursion into deep time which took me deep into humanity's future and gave me one of my clearest experiences of what I call the future human the the human being that humanity is in the process of becoming our next evolutionary type so it gets easier but you never know when you know it can come up and slap you hard if it wants to take you somewhere special yeah that's something something I learned all too well and is definitely shared amongst the other deep explorers that I know it's just like just be careful because as soon as you get brazen it'll teach you a lesson about comes no matter how competent you feel so maybe now is a good time to to move into some closing because we're just about the hour mark here pretty quick mm-hmm you stopped doing this yes and and and and I kind of already have a sense of where the answer is going so I'm curious how to ask the question because I I'm simultaneously wondering why did you stop yeah while also wondering you know what did these experiences how did they change your relationship to dying like your your physical death as a human now yeah though that's that's sort of like the large open-ended question yeah well let me take that last question first because it's the easiest I am so looking forward not necessarily to the process of dying but I am so looking forward to being dead with absolute and complete confidence because I know where I'm going and I've died I've made that transition so many times in my sessions I feel very comfortable with what's going to be happening after this body falls away hmm okay I stopped these sessions it's not that I stopped sessions altogether but I stopped this particular series of sessions I stopped working with high doses of LSD for two reasons one was pain and the other was heartache when you're working with such extremely high doses of LSD it's just an enormous demands it places enormous demands on your body and on your subtle energy system and what I found and this I talk about in diamonds from heaven what I found is that after many years my energy was just running so hot I was carrying too much energy was like I was almost never comfortable in my body I wasn't having flashbacks or anything like that but literally my subtle energy system was so taxed by entering in and out of these states and a rhythmic even just five times a year that I had to stop to let my whole system calm down cool down and find its new equilibrium but the main reason I stopped is different the main reason I stopped us heartache I literally could not take the heartache of being separated from the divine anymore I had entered and was entering so deeply into the diamond luminosity so deeply into the crystalline nature of whatever you want to call it the divine or the absolute err i had dissolved and lost my body my boundaries and entered and become light so many times and with such exquisite joy that coming back into time-space became just a terrible heartache and eventually I reached a point where I decided better not to go back at all than to have to go and leave and so I made a kind of an agreement with I called the absolute my words for the absolute tourism might be love it because it was a love relationship that unfolded so I made a deal with my beloved to never take me back that deeply again until I would not have to leave and that's really why I stopped my sessions I thought that I could just because I really paid a lot of attention to integration all the way through the process you know I really tried to do it right do all the things you do to really solidly integrate each individual session and I thought that I could therefore stop my sessions and then I would be able to harvest the insights and the experiences that I had been blessed with on during those years what I found was however that in the years following really a number of years I began to enter into what I call the deep sadness I begin to enter into a sense of existential loneliness I just I was so I was missing the divine so deeply back now in time and space that basically life had began to feel all dried up I really I really wasn't that interested in being here and I found that I was just waiting to die I was just waiting to die so I could return to the light in years past and I began to realize slowly oh this isn't good this is not the way it's supposed to be I knew that this was not the way it was supposed to end up and I didn't understand what had happened because I had been so careful with integration all the way through I wasn't clear to me where I had where had gone wrong but my life was telling me was screaming failure to integrate fail you to integrate in time I began to realize that what had happened was I had lost a balance between transcendence and imminence between letting go and going beyond all time-space reality and being grounded solidly with in time and space reality time of space is the manifest body of the divine I know it's the divine I've experienced it as the manifest being of the divine it's not that there are two Divine's are just the you know transcendent divine in the imminent divine but I had plunged so deeply into the transcendent divine that I kind of lost my foothold I lost my grounding in the imminent divine and I I made a it took about ten years but I made a determined commitment to reground myself into physical existence to temper my memories of transcendence with my appreciation and enjoyment of the manifest divine around me continuously and that took a long time but eventually I did and eventually I became more comfortable being here one of the problems one of the things I ran into in going through this process one of the challenges wasn't simply withdrawing from this intimate communion it was living in the silence that had been imposed on me by our psychedelic phobic culture I wasn't allowed to speak about my experiences I couldn't teach from them I could not bring them to my colleagues I could not really write in complete abandon I could not do what I had been trained to do as a philosopher of religion I couldn't philosophize based on these experiences I wasn't part of a psychedelic subset in Ohio and I knew that if I began this conversation I would be fired you know I would just and I love to teach I love being with my students so this be the split between my public life and my life became increasingly burdensome and then when I stopped the sessions it became even more burdensome that I I didn't have a place to process my experiences so what I found is that there's there's a level of integration that could take place privately psychologically before I started to speak and then when I began working on diamonds from heaven and I began to give the talks as I this book was coming to its conclusion and I began to share with people what it actually what I had actually done and where it had gone so I could not only share what I had experienced but take in what they had experienced I found that the integration of those experiences began to deepen they began to live in me differently than they had lived before I began to speak about them and that's that's begun a process that's still continuing to unfold I don't know where it's going to go but somehow the transcendent divine and the imminent divine seem to be reaching a deeper merging a deeper synthesis in my life now that I finally you know share the conversation I've opened the conversation there's there's a couple more questions I have for you if you've got the time yeah this one might be a bit quick you were just you were uncomfortable physically because of this you know hi subtle energy were you doing any physical spiritual practices yoga tai chi nothing like that yes sir I I was doing first I was doing meditation and Vaudrey and during all of my years and in the last five years I was really doing formal Vajrayana practices I was taking good care of my body I was doing yoga I was really maintaining a very careful that at that time a vegetarian diet I was really taking a lot of care of my body I was doing chiropractic care I was doing massages I was really taking care of the instrument okay cool that was I was curious about because that might be an area where it's like oh maybe if you were doing yoga yeah yeah cool so this other question is very personal why I mean everything you've shared is obviously very personal but this is the kind of personal that a lot of people hesitate to share so I certainly don't have to answer this no pressure which is what kind of a toll did these experiences take on your capacity to be intimate with other people because I know for myself when I was it's less now but when I was going regularly very deep into my mushroom experiences yeah I often felt very existentially alone and like I couldn't relate to other people and I couldn't relate to I didn't I felt like there was this vital area of relationship in my romantic partnerships that was always missing because they didn't go there as well and so I always felt alone in those explorations yeah so I'm just curious what kind of a because I'm assuming that your intimate partners weren't going as like regularly deep as yourself you know what kind of a impact did that have on your ability to be at the human level and be intimately relating with other people or with lovers no I know exactly what you're referring to I understand that loneliness and that loneliness was the unexpected cost of doing this work I of all the things I had anticipated entering into this essentially a shamanic path the loneliness and separation from other people was the most unexpected and it's kind of curious because because of the experiences my capacity to enter into other people's lives to empathically enter into their experience had deepened enormous ly but unless they were a psychedelic and Italy initiated themselves they had no capacity to understand what were to me the most important experiences of my life and so naturally the a certain distance grew up between myself and my social relationships and in this anyway so there is and there is a sense the world there's a place in Carlos Gustin ADA's book where Don Juan is talking to Don Genaro and Don and Genaro says the world is only real when I'm with him meaning Don Juan which means there's a sense in which if you take up the psychedelic path or any practice which really opens up deeper and deeper levels of experience it does inadvertent it inevitably separates you're on a different Road than the people around you who are interested only in physical tangible things and so there is a loneliness that comes with that I find that this loneliness is for me is easing as I become more public and I enter into conversations with people like yourself who have had their own experiences and we can share these things and it's easier now in terms of my most intimate relationships I've been very blessed in that respect I've been married twice carol was a my first wife we were married for 24 years she was my wife during all the years when I was doing this work she was my sitter in all of this work she is a very mystical inclined person as a deep Buddhist practitioner she never was interested in doing sessions it just wasn't she was they always seemed too violent for her and she really was meditators everything she needed she found on her meditation cushion and in some ways it wasn't until I began at very advanced levels of this congress this engagement when I was moving into the diamond luminosity that I felt like I began to understand her for the first time so she was a highly developed spiritual being after we have separated and she has remarried and I have remarried she has gone on to complete her Vajrayana training she's done her three year three months retreat with her teacher in Santa Fe New Mexico to kill Sonic so she's a serious practitioner and so I didn't experience lack of headroom in my conversation with her I always thought like in some ways even though the experiences were different but in some ways the more I did this work the closer we were coming existentially in that way and after after I stopped my sessions we came to a point where we separated with for reasons that don't have to do with the sessions themselves we just came to a parting of our ways and we're still friends and but then I was blessed with a second marriage that with Cristina Hardy and Cristina Hardy is also a journey err so she understood experientially the dimensions that I had entered into she understood them from her own experience she's also an astrologer so she's very deeply a daughter of the earth and a daughter of the stars so she kind of lives deeply grounded in the reality and the texture in the textures of time and space and in the rhythms of time and space so that in my most intimate relationships I've been blessed to be with to wit who were able to understand the unique experiences that I was going through it would have been very lonely to be with people who where you experience intimacy at one level but you don't experience that intimacy at another level yeah the final question that I have I want to hold on it for a second because you said something and I just want to make sure I understand cuz it if I understand I think it's an important point you said that your first wife never she did not want to do what you were doing because she found it too violent and you said at a certain point you began to understand her is that what you mean you started to understand why she wouldn't choose to do what you were doing no it wasn't that particularly I I shouldn't say focused just on the violence she really she's a very gentle and a naturally mystically oriented person and she found the the vehemence of the cleansing portion of the sessions very hard for her to relate to she also found the temporary nature that you would have these deep temporary experiences but then you would come back and you couldn't hold on you could remember them but you couldn't embody them and she she was more attracted to a path where you basically could hold on to more of your experiences it was a slower path of initiation but you could hold on to more of your experiences what I mean was by when I say I began to be able to understand her more deeply that there is a sense in which her natural way of tuning into the universe and the universe that she tuned into that is what I began to appreciate more deeply that when when I began to touch into the diamond luminosity I touched him to a reality that was so absorbing and so powerful for me that basically nothing else in my sessions mattered except reconnecting with that reality and I began to appreciate how her entire life ever since she had been a girl had all been oriented towards accessing and stabilizing this deep participation in the universe okay that's what it was yes I gotcha I am glad for the clarification because I might have misunderstood as you know you've said in your talks I'll swear that that you wouldn't recommend this path for other people and that you know if you could go back you would be you know quote easier on yourself and so I want I wondered if that's if that's what you are leaning towards I would be gentler for a number of reasons one is because I learned that it's not a matter of getting to an end destination it's a matter of becoming open living as much of the infinite enter into your being as you can absorb and in if that's the approach if it's really about grounding the transcendent experiences here and now in this body then that is often served better by working with lower doses that allow you to hold on to more of what you experience so I really don't recommend what I did I mean I really think I pushed myself it it took a great deal of concentration a great commitment to do to go some of the places I went and I don't think it's necessary in order to spiritually wake up to have the to go where I went I'm I just have more compassion for myself and I wouldn't want some people anybody to to undergo some of the things I went through hmm okay thank you so the final question before the other you know the understandable opportunity to promote your new book and get people more connected with you yeah is about integration maybe a fuller understanding for us like what it means to integrate because there are there's you know one thing about you know writing the stuff down I remember you had explained that the next day you would write it down like narrative eyes it listening to the same music you listen to during the session and they would name each session so that as soon as you looked at the name you would have a sense of what that session contained which is million thank you Bob on behalf of all psychedelics bars thank you for that and you've you've also mentioned the the vital importance of relationship in the integration process in other talks and so those two things sort of laid out how do you integrate something as profound and massive as the things that you would had gone through yeah I think some of the challenges the personal challenges that I faced around integration is one of the reasons I precisely would recommend that people don't do what I did precisely because it with these substances we can project ourselves we can dissolve so deeply into these vast territories that it truly becomes mind-boggling how does how do you integrate them in fact I mean as long as you're staying inside time and space and you're uncovering your pains of your past and your oncoming trauma for this life or former lives we have therapeutic models for what integration looks like and how to do it and if you go deeper and you experience the intelligence that runs through things and you experience you know the certainty of continuity of life after death we still have spiritual models for what it means to integrate those experiences into our life and when you look at the near-death episode research people have very deep one-time experiences of transcendence we have a sense of how to integrate that material but it truly is one of the leftover questions of my life is what does integration mean when you when you're going so deep into deep time how do you integrate a hundred thousand year swathes of time into Monday Tuesday Wednesday consciousness how do you integrate becoming one when you are you know just one among many again how do you integrate you know going so deep into the future that you're looking at the next evolutionary stage of the human process how do you integrate that with coming back and going back to work in the morning after I finished my sessions shortly thereafter in my morning meditation spirit said to me 20 years in 20 years old and I thought okay I understood what that meant it would take me at least 20 years to integrate the experiences that I had cultivated over those 20 years and I thought that sounds about right but now dark neither the diamonds from heaven will be published 20 years after I stopped my sessions so I really have been looking at how much I've been able to hold on to during those 20 years and where it's taken me and as I mentioned the depth of the loneliness that I experienced was not because of a failure in my sessions it was actually because of success the success that you have entering into the universe becomes the challenge of integration when you come back again I found that as long as I was keeping silent as long as I was really not communicating from my center about these experiences on integration could only take us it could only proceed to a certain level when I wrote dark night early dawn where I first began to unpack some of these experiences it would not allowed me to enter into some conversation that allowed this integration this deeper integration to manifest but it wasn't really until I began to write diamonds from heaven that I began to experience a deeper level of integration manifest and I guess the way I would put it is like this I don't think you can integrate the infinite into the finite by its very definition almost you can't integrate infinity into finite existence the only thing you can do is integrate your finite existence into infinity you must surrender to the infinite moment to moment day to day opportunity to opportunity you must kind of become a servant of the infinite surrender completely to that involution airy process that sri aurobindo talks about and I think that I mean I'm I'm a teacher my natural instinct is to learn and to share and the laws around psychedelics interrupted my own natural way of being in the world now that I'm retired now that I've passed my statute of limitations for my psychedelic crimes now that I can speak about these things now that I can those two different sides of my life are coming together and really for the first time in my adult life I feel like I'm beginning to be a whole person again as I'm beginning to be a whole person something is happening in my relationship within myself in the universe and also something is happening in my relationship with other people because the depth of the consciousness which is alive in me is also the depth of the consciousness it's alive in you and so when we come together this deeper kind of you know fluctuation surfaces underneath both of us and I find this when I'm teaching and when I'm working in workshops or with groups is a deeper aliveness that in earlier years I had to hold it bay I had to kind of tamp down now it's beginning now I can let it come through now it comes forward I don't know where this deeper integration is going to go I don't know where it's going to take me it's taking me places that I have not been before except in the sessions but in times of my physical consciousness my time-space consciousness there is a certain transparency that catches me up that's fresh and there is a certain wholeness that arises when I'm with people that is fresh and I don't know where it's going to go another 20 years of this it's I have no idea where it's going to lead me but I like it it feels natural and it feels like integration is continuing to take place so I don't consider myself finished with this integration process at all cool well thank you very much for that Chris and thank you so much for this whole conversation today we do give maybe you could end us off with letting the listeners know where they can find out more about you where they could get your your I'm not sure if your diamonds from heaven just released yet but you're three books what their names are as well as your social media handles well actually my website is still in the process of being made so can't go there yet but soon diamonds from heaven the book that we've been talking about will be released from inner traditions in 2019 probably next summer in this it'll be in the second half of 2019 my three earlier books was first life cycles which is a book on reincarnation research second book was dark night early dawn where I basically am integrating psychedelic research and incorporating my own experiences with near-death episode research and out-of-body research so it's it's an extensive unfortunately kind of academically dense if rigorous but dense discussion of some of these issues the third book is called the living classroom all of these are available in Amazon the living classroom basically is describing something that was happening in my classroom while I was doing my psychedelic work in the backside I don't talk about psychedelics there at all but it's about fields of consciousness it's about the contagious nature of states of consciousness because what I found was that when I was doing this work and keeping it private from all my students nevertheless some of my students started to be activated by my own work and so I you know it was like I began to understand and have to work with the contagious quality of states of consciousness and then diamonds from heaven is the book just finished where I basically go back to the very beginning and simply take people through layer by layer the entire sequence of events because I found that you can't even begin the philosophical conversation about psychedelic States unless people in this case editors of professional journals and things unless they're convinced that these are legitimate experiences and the only two ways to be convinced that these are legitimate experiences is to either have the experiences yourself or to be to undergo a secondary initiation by reading other people's accounts of their experiences and kind of picking up on it through kind of osmosis and that's what I'm hoping that diamonds from heaven my I don't think my experiences are special or unique in any way they may have pushed a little harder than some people but I think they fall within the broad range of experiences that people have I'm just trying to lay them out in an organized fashion so that people can become more familiar with these states and I hope maybe hopefully it'll it'll help people in their own psychedelic work but I also hope it will be useful to people who never take a psychedelic because it's what's important is not the method but what the method teaches us about the universe itself and as a philosopher that's what my interest in is letting people see the universe as the universe showed it to me in these sessions mmm yeah beautiful thanks thanks so much Chris are you on social media anywhere I'm on Facebook but I really I'm not really well grounded in social media I'll have my website up hopefully within just a couple of and I'll be collecting I mean I my stalks are scattered all over the web you know if you google me you'll come up with a whole bunch of videos and and talks but I haven't consolidated them and presented them enough in one place cool well I I will make a little bit of an effort to consolidate some stuff including links to all your books where people can buy them and your website once it's live at James W G so calm under the page that has the

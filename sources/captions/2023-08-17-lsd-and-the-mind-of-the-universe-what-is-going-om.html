      <p>foreign [Music] welcome to what is going on for New thought from the edge of om each week on omtimes flagship radio show veteran broadcaster author and media consultant Sandy sedgebeer conducts thought-provoking interviews with inspirational authors artists musicians scientists speakers and filmmakers who are working at the point where spirituality and science meet Consciousness at the very edge of um here is your host Sandy sedgebeer hello throughout the years that I've been conducting interviews on science Consciousness and spirituality I've read numerous mind shifting books and heard goodness knows how many extraordinary stories but The Story You're going to hear today is so far beyond remarkable that I've struggled to find words to adequately describe it all I can say by way of introduction is that what you're about to hear is a story that I didn't know until I read it that I and no doubt countless millions of seekers have been waiting for our entire lives Christopher M Bay she's professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University where he talked for 33 years a fellow at The Institute of noetic Sciences he's also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of integral studies and on The Advisory board for Gruff transpersonal training and the Groff Foundation an award-winning teacher and international speaker Chris Bates joins me now to discuss his book LSD and the mind of the universe diamonds from Heaven which has been held as a grouping account of an utterly unique and extraordinary hero's journey that opens our minds and hearts to a new vision of our universe and ourselves as Inseparable from the ineffable being that we have called God Chris bash welcome ascending it's a pleasure to be here with you today this is a long-awaited interview I have to say Chris so little background in 1979 you took the first step on a life-changing journey to explore your mind in the mind of the universe as deeply and systematically as possible with the help of LSD if you had known then that it would take 20 years of excruciating pain suffering Bliss and intense purification plus many more years of digesting process in organizing and writing to publish this book would you still have put yourself through it that's a good question I'm not sure that I would I think knowing now what I if I had known then what I'd known now I would have been gentler on myself I would have used in a gentler product called balancing High versus low doses balancing lse with psilocybin and ayahuasca um I still would have taken the journey but it might not have been as taken as aggressively as I did yeah yeah well knowing the outcome you can't really say no I wouldn't have done it so you've experienced 73 high-dose LSB sessions following protocols established by stanislavgolf with the intention of engaging hyper intensive States in a way that would allow the initial chaos at each new level to clear and also allow your own biophysical and psychological systems to adapt how did you know the precise dosage to accomplish that in the way that you wanted to well Stan was very clear in his early books and in LSD Psychotherapy it was published in 1980 uh the protocol differences between psycholytic and low-dose therapy versus psychedelic high-dose therapy cyclic running doses anywhere from 50 150 micrograms and high-dose psychedelic therapy between four to 500 350 to 500 and at that time high-dose psychedelic therapy was being worked used at Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore and they were trying to basically trigger something approximating a near-death experience for people who were dying they were terminal patients and trying to give them a glimpse of where they were going and I thought well if you could do this work three times safely then you could do it more than three times safely and I chose to work with high doses of LSD for a couple of reasons one night I had an a false model of of what the project was the model I had was a model of personal transformation I thought this was about my personal healing my personal Spiritual Awakening uh that turned out to be an incomplete profoundly incomplete model and I was thinking that you know Spiritual Awakening is about Clearing Your Karma our Karma ultimately is finite and by working with high doses I would basically being uh it was I knew it would be more difficult work but I thought of myself as basically biting off my karma and larger bites and clearing it faster turns out that that's a false model personal transformation was too small to describe it and the doses I took from the literature I basically wanted to push my system as hard as I could to be efficient I mean I was in the Dual career marriage getting time for these sessions was very complicated it had to balance a lot of schedules and I wanted to get as much done in every session as I could uh again what I learned on along the way is because Consciousness is Unified at its source that when you hyperstimulate Consciousness you're not just hyper stimulating your personal field of Consciousness you're hyper stimulating some portion of the unified field of Consciousness and therefore the dynamic that get activated the Dynamics of healing and purification and illumination uh are much much larger than uh personal Dynamics but what point did you realize this this would be a personal Journey at all that there was so much more going on well for about the first two and a half years it looked it followed very much the the material that Stan Groff had been tracking my first two and a half years of work were very much perinatal in nature going through the death rebirth process experiencing re-experiencing one's birth experiencing a profound confrontation with death and the meaninglessness of existence but then I this culminated in a crushing ego death experience and a liberating ego death experience and then according to Stan's early descriptions what I was expecting after going through ego death access to transpersonal reality would get easier but what happened in my sessions is that I began to go through that periods of vast suffering that got deeper and deeper and larger uh terrible suffering and pain not personal Collective opening up to the suffering of thousands and hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of years of time and at first I thought this represented a deepening of ego death but it went on for so long and it involved so many people that eventually I had no alternative to but to come to the conclusion that what was being healed or transformed in this process was not my personal psyche but some aspect of the collective psyche of humanity that just as personal trauma gets internalized in our personal psyche and can produce pathology likewise the vast quantities of of trauma that Humanity has absorbed through history gets collected and internalized in the collective psyche and produces a kind of social pathology at the collective level and something was using my sessions to basically address and heal to some degree um this Collective trauma so they didn't say didn't see anything random about this journey because sometimes you didn't have a session for long periods even years but when you went back you always seem to you know catch up where you were at the time before yeah that was my sense of it too that um I was engaging a long and sustained conversation communion initiation with a larger Consciousness and the size and scale of this Consciousness kept deepening and changing as my work continued um and it I always felt myself engaging in intelligence when this is most dramatic perhaps this continuity across time I did four years of work I stopped for six years and then I started again for another 10 years of work when I stopped I was working on the ocean of suffering material in the purification phase of a session I was engaged in this ocean of suffering I stopped for six years six years later in a completely different time of my life with different expectations when I went into the work again the ocean of suffering started exactly where it had stopped and continued indicating clearly that the the intelligence that I was engaging was guiding what was happening it was in charge of my sessions and all I did was really open up isolate myself from the world open up and follow wherever it wanted to take me and I found that if I trusted myself completely and surrendered to where it would take me I would go through these intense purification processes or death processes eventually it would culminate in some type of Crisis or breakthrough and then I would be spun into ecstatic revelatory experiences for the remainder of the session and the next session would begin the cycle again so I just I learned to trust that process but but the suffering you know there were I was listening to it on Audible as well as reading the book and there were times when I was you know speaking to you and saying my goodness why are you going back you know it's so painful yeah you go back not because the you know I don't like pain who likes pain for nothing like that you go back for the joy that's waiting on the other side of pain you go back on with the understanding that this the suffering this pain is in some way a purification process which I did not understand the full scope of it at the time but I trusted Stan's work and it was affirmed in my work that this is a purification process and that when you go through it then the doors open and that's why you do it for the revelations for the insights for the Visions for the for the opportunity to enter into such deep and profound communion with the universe so the suffering is the Gateway it's a Gateway it's it's just a pro you know we have to let go of being small in order to enter into being large and it's not always easy to let go of being small but it's not just let going letting go of your personal identity you know we'll in therapy we often focus on ego death and many of the mystical Traditions focus on ego death but what I found was that ego death was just the first of many patterns of death and rebirth so that what one is letting go of at deeper levels of the journey are much larger much deeper than just egoic structures and it's such a mystery that at the end of the book I actually have an appendix where I ask the question what dies when you're so far beyond ego death and yet you are still having sensations of dying loss of control what is it that's actually dying in that process yeah yeah exactly and when we listen to it you know we can't help asking the same question so um I don't want to focus too much on individual sessions but there was one that I really did want to bring up and it's actually a whole collection of sessions where you experience life as many different women in turn what do you think was the purpose of those experiences and how did they impact you well that was my that was my ego death experience where the the universe after about this is the 10th session ninth ten session it just broke me like a twig it just took my identity and snapped it now I had begun the day as a white ivy league educated philosopher passionately concerned with the meaning of existence and the universe forced me to become the exact opposite of that I became women I became women of color I became women who were not interested in the meaning of life at all who were not educated at all and it did not allow me to experience I was myself but I was myself in all these other roles other modes and it it terrified me it just scared the bejeebus out of me and I fought it but eventually when I gave up and I surrendered and I allowed myself to become all these women then suddenly things shifted and I was taken under the arm of the great mother and initiated into the lives of hundreds of women the more positive side of female experience given many experiences of women's lives conceiving giving birth loving husbands loving children and I think the the fundamental message here was not reclaim your former lives as women I I know I have former lives as women that has never been a question for me I think the issue was where you are going gender does not exist let go so I was being taken into a level of reality where male female is irrelevant but to do that I had to be broken of my male identity I had to allow myself to go into some larger identity and becoming women was simply just part of that breaking process all um 20 years seems to have been quite a massive breaking process I mean you were doing this nobody knew about it except your wife you weren't allowed to talk about it to anyone or you didn't allow yourself to you were teaching mature students philosophy and often you know there were aspects of things that you were teaching where your experiences would have been the perfect example to offer them but you couldn't do that what was that like for you it wasn't so bad in the beginning but it got increasingly difficult as I went on especially when I could feel a question coming from students that had personal deep significance to them and an answer would spontaneously rise from my person which but an answer that was grounded in my psychedelic experience and I couldn't some of them I could lay off on the Stan Groff's experiences or other psychedelic research experiences but some of them I couldn't lay off and I could not bring my own psychedelic experiences forward and I began to experience a catch in my throat my voice would actually kind of I would lose control for a split second and it would sound like a little bark coming out of my voice it was embarrassing I mean I was I was literally strangling on what I wanted to say and was not allowed to say and that became difficult I because the cost of doing this work I knew would be my silence and I paid that price but I did not realize in the beginning that when you commit to dividing your life in this way to have a a daytime job as a straight professor and then a nighttime job as a psychonaut that it causes fractures in your psyche which reach deeper than you may have anticipated in the beginning and in the end uh these cracks were only able to be healed when I finally uh came out of the Psychedelic closet and began to allow myself to speak openly about these experiences um most people these days especially in the spiritual Arena are familiar with ndes reincarnation channeled works that explain who we are and where we go in the afterlife and you've taught courses on these yourselves but your experience took you Way Beyond where anyone has gone before it gave you a whole new vision of the Bardo tell us a bit about that well the classic understanding of the Bardo I think was affirmed in my sessions that is there are many many many layers of spiritual reality and when we die we return to that layer that reflects our Spiritual Development or our spiritual maturity and it's a it's a it's a social domain there there are other beings there not only other uh incarnate beings or discarnate beings but there are also Guardians and and guides and so forth and the basic idea is after you die you go through a debrief process in which you process your most recently completed life you learn what you kind of what you did poorly and what you did very well um you go through this process and then you go through kind of a returning to the world of spirit to returning home and eventually you go through when it's time to Incarnate again to the choice process of incarnating again and because because the evolution of the soul is so vast and covers such a wide spectrum of development it takes many many lifetimes to actualize the full potential of a human existence and so there are many tiers of the Bardo domain in my experience affirms this classic Vision I had many experiences of kind of tapping into Bridal reality and it's a collective reality I think the ocean of suffering kind of is analogous to the Buddhist concept of the hell Realm uh I tapped into levels which would be analogous to the the high deity realm uh in the Buddhist cosmology of the six Locas or the six realms and there are also there is a reality that's outside the Bardo when you get basically in a sense graduate from the earth system when you move beyond that spiritual echo of time space experience and enter into the reality beyond all Bardo existence and that is correlated with what I would describe as the diamond Luminosity the domain of diamond luminosity why do you call it that because that's that's that was the experience um one encounters light often in deep spiritual experiences and near-death experiences in psychedelic experiences when you go through a death rebirth process often you have the sensation of being flooded with light encountering light is it's almost a universal in the spiritual traditions um and I had experienced light at many forms and many times in my practice but when I came to this Advanced stage of my work which started with the 45th session I encountered a light that was unlike anything I had encountered previously it was in incredibly bright incredibly beautiful and clear the hardest thing to describe when I say light it's almost like it becomes so refined and so intense it becomes invisible it's just clear clear your mind is just so incredibly clear and I came to understand what the Buddhists meant when they say touching this for one second undoes thousands of years of living in the shadows of karma it is radically pure clear and once I touched that I wasn't interested in exploring any of the other dimensions of spiritual reality that I had encountered before which include Collective Dimensions the collective unconscious archetypal reality even dimensions of causal Oneness this was something totally completely different and in the last five years of my work in 26 sessions which is one third of my entire journey I only touched this reality four times okay and and every time I touched it it would trigger more purification more detoxification and a Year's worth of work before I was able to come back and touch it again wow and was that something having touched it that kept you going you know had you seeking it again and again absolutely yeah the last third of my work that was my agenda was to go back so do whatever I needed to do to go back into that reality so if I understand this right and you know I haven't read a huge amount about the Bardo but what you're saying is that there are these different layers if you like almost stages and um over probably Millennia we gradually go through them but you went through them you know in that much time um you know what kind of effect does that have on someone well I want to be careful here um I think what happens in a psychedelic therapeutically focused psychedelic session or spiritually focused psychedelic session is that you speed up what is happening in life at a slower Pace in a natural process so reincarnation as I understand it we are growing we are evolving we die we return to Soul Consciousness we're born we can track down into egoic Consciousness we die we go back into Soul Consciousness and that we keep this up and keep this up over long periods of time we we choose lives which challenge us stretch us heal us allow us to develop new talents new capacities to deepen the capacities that we've started what happens I think in psychedelic therapy is that that whole process is accelerated this is I think this is true for meditation in meditation when you do long sustained Retreats of meditation you are speeding up the process that's taking place at a slower pace in ordinary life and so I get you do bite off larger pieces of personal Karma but then something else takes over it's not about your personal Enlightenment it's not about your personal development uh your ties to the Human family your ties to the family of Life your ties to the universe deepen and you begin to feel a sense of dance or a sense of Engagement of this deep profound life process and I think I think you can take it too far then it's comfortable you can take it so deeply you can you can be dissolved so completely into these vast flows of Consciousness and vast dimensions of existence that it's very hard to come back out of them and it's it's hard in the sense that it's hard to leave the joy it's hard to leave the clarity and the Ecstasy and come back into time and space now that doesn't mean because you've touched them and because you've known them it doesn't mean that you can stabilize that awareness back inside time and space it doesn't mean that you have accomplished what some of the great spiritual teachers have accomplished who can abide one foot in one foot out in those realities I really really emphasize this is a path of temporary immersion temporary you have not just because you've had a temporary experience of Oneness of life or Transcendence doesn't mean that you are as fully developed a spiritual being as somebody who can abide in that reality and I all honor truly to the great spiritual Masters who have abiding the capacity to abide in that reality so I wouldn't say necessarily that I accomplished all of those evolutionary Journeys in one lifetime but I I certainly did do something pointing in that direction but you also you can't unknow what you know and when you come back knowing what you know it must be hell to you know have to you know move into a world that is so far away from that that is just you know falling apart on every level I mean how do you cope with that it's such a dichotomy it is challenging uh there are mitigating processes though too because the deeper your experience of the intelligence of life and the joy of the creative intelligence in manifesting existence then you begin to look around you and you see the universe for what it is the universe is the body of the Divine the body of God the universe is the manifestation of the intelligence of a profound intelligence and once you touch that intelligence I mean we all know what intelligence looks and feels like we we recognize it when we meet it in people and this is a cosmic intelligence that just overwhelms you with its Brilliance and its wisdom and overwhelms you with love unlike beyond anything I had ever known in this lifetime and I've known love in this lifetime this is a different order of love and once you experience those things then it changes how you see the universe it changes how you see life and it also gives you a larger Horizon within which to understand The Human Experience I mean it I re I adopted reincarnation on the basis of the empirical evidence early in my career I read Ian Stevenson's work I read the early work on a past life therapist and I was convinced intellectually that reincarnation was a fact of life but it still takes years to truly absorb and live into the fabric of a universe that pulses in a reincarnation cycle not just for the individual but for the entire human species so I had experiences in which I understood my current Life as a continuity of extending from previous lifetimes but I also had at a deeper level experiences of the entire human species pulsing Generation by generation pulsing in essay reincarnating species and that all of our individual challenges and our individual Karma was a fractal manifestation of this larger species challenge in this species Karma that we were working and when you have those experiences you look at other human beings differently you look at the planet differently you look at the Galaxy differently there is a sense of deeper participation in a mystery which you may not understand the details of but you can feel the joy because you know the you've touched the intelligence that's behind it and that makes it eat that makes it more joyful to enter into it now there is a sadness that you can't sustain those Peak experiences but in another month or two or I was doing this about four or five times a year I would go back into this reality and not every time necessarily but I would go back often enough that I would be able to drink deeply again the full cost of how deep I went did not really emerge until I stopped my sessions at the end of the journey I the universe basically told me it was time to stop and I could feel that it was time to stop and I stopped but it was only then when I wasn't returning in a few months to have another deep communion with my beloved that I began to realize the true cost of overextending overextending myself as deeply as I had into the transcendental side of existence um before we go to the break there's a one question you said that the universe is the body of God what are we are part of the universe so we are part of the body of God too we are part of the manifestation of the intention of the universe to create our mind just as our body is rooted in the quantum uh reality of life and the atomic reality of life and the whole evolutionary story is built into the nerves and the vascular systems and the organs of our body so we become inseparable from life as it is manifesting in the galaxy in the planet on this continent likewise our minds are part of the creative intelligence that's manifesting existence that's why when we go deep into our minds we we drop down into the cursed depth of our personal mind and we find that there is no floor at the bottom of our mind we fall right through into the mind of the species right through into the mind of the universe and when when you go that deep then then the Hindu teaching Atman is Brahman the essence of the individual is the essence of the totality that just becomes the most natural thing in the world that becomes core truth and one of the likewise a core truth is Oneness to ex Brahman is one and we are part we are an aspect of fractal manifestation of that Oneness once one has known that even when you go back to paying your bills and and doing the things we do in the physical world all you have to do is step back and then you can reappreciate these deeper truths which are the deeper pulsing of life hmm we're going to take a short break now um I'm Sandy sedgebear my guest today is eminent philosopher and theologian speaker and author Christopher M baish whose latest book LSD in the mind of the universe diamonds from Heaven which rigorously Chronicles his intensive systematic 73 session 20 years psychedelic series of Journeys into a unified field of Consciousness that underlies all physical existence this is completely mind-blowing so I need a break just to reset my mind so that I can ask intelligent questions we'll be back in a few moments stay tuned welcome back Chris space you've made it quite clear that there is an evolutionary Dimension to all of this and as you move into the later chapters in the book where you talk about the birth of the diamond Soul you begin to see that we are at an evolutionary cusp and the Global Systems crisis that you know we're all experiencing right now is part of that for what point what what is the ultimate you know purpose here of all of this happening well let me break that down into two parts the classical Vision First on reincarnation a few words the classical vision of reincarnation as it's held in most eastern Traditions is that you grow you get clear Kinder more generous you could cultivate deeper and better qualities and eventually you come to a spiritual maturing where your Consciousness opens to the core of your being and you awaken to the fact that the essence of your nature is in fact the essence of all nature and that all beings and you are sharing the same nature there's an explosion of compassion a deep Embrace of the universe and their interpretation of what happens next is that you are now free to leave time and space you uh in the Hindus called it Moksha escape to escape samsara and this up and out cosmology all the religions of the axial age in one way or another are all part of a pattern of an up and out cosmology we don't want to be on earth we got here by accident it's a veil of Tears we want to get out of here either by salvation or Enlightenment we want to get out of here but that leaves fundamentally unexplained what is the purpose of the universe what is the purpose of This Magnificent creation and now we have a deeper understanding of the size of existence the magnitude of the universe how many billions of years went into the evolving and unfolding of the universe and it just becomes profoundly unacceptable short-sighted to think that the purpose of life is to awaken to your true nature and then Escape into Nirvana or Escape into some off-planet Paradise at a critical point in my work I had the experience of all of my former lives coming into me they were just coming in one right after another and it was like wrapping string white filament of light white light around a kite spool and at a certain point all those lives fused into one Consciousness and at that point there was an explosion of this diamond light out of my chest and I was catapulted into a a deeper State of Consciousness than I had ever touched before and I was an individual but an individual Beyond any frame of reference that I had ever known and this is what I came to call the birth of the diamond soul and that is I think that as we incarnate over and over and over and over again sooner or later the sole Consciousness that we return to when we die wakes up and manifests inside our time space Consciousness we literally the soul wakes up inside time and space fully conscious a hundred thousand year old being not a hundred year old being fully Consciousness with an intuitive awareness of the breadth of Human Relationships and an ability to enter into deeper communion with the cosmic intelligence and at that point we don't leave at that point we begin to live differently on the planet and I think the entire human species is evolving into the in this direction to this point the entire human species is evolving into fully manifesting Soul Consciousness and you know when I say soul Consciousness I don't mean separate isolated from each other fully transparenta emptiness no self-concept all affirmed but a soul manifesting Consciousness and if you can imagine a planet of a species filled with Souls fully conscious Souls that species would create a different life on this planet than we've ever seen before at another point in my work later in my work I began actually over a period of about four years amidst everything else that was going on in my sessions I began to have dumped into my awareness a series of Visions about human evolution and the message was always the same we're coming to a turning point a point of profound Spiritual Awakening a before and after in human history that it would involve tremendous Collective purification but this Collective purification was emptying out the kind of the Pains of History to allay a New Foundation for this infusion a new infusion of divine energy that was rising up within us it was clear that and I was given a taste glimpses of the future human this a transformed Humanity that would emerge out of this but it never showed me how nature was going to pull this off it never showed me how this would would work and then several years later in 1995 when I was already had already transitioned to the diamond Luminosity phase of my work so I was working in pretty Advanced places on a particular day at the end of 95 when I was expecting to be taken hopefully back into the diamond Luminosity instead it took me it dissolved me into the species and so Chris Bass Just dissolved into the Human family and then asked the Human family I was taken into the future into what I call Deep time and there I began to experience what I came to understand was a death and rebirth process that was impacting the entire Human family just as an individual goes through an intense death rebirth process when they do spiritual practice or psychedelic practice history was putting the entire Human family into a death rebirth process I experienced an unraveling of Life a profound loss of control we were losing control of all the ordinary assumptions of Life there was just a cascading series of crises that were breaking us down level by level I was not given any details I I wasn't given any calendar of events but this was a global crisis that seemed to be triggered by us cascading series of ecological crises beyond that I wasn't given the details but the whole the whole system of life it was coming Crashing Down and then just when it was at its worst just when it seemed like we would all be dying that this was an Extinction event the peak of the storm passed and things began to get easier and we began to pick ourselves up and we began to rebuild civilization and when we did our entire existence was different we were suffused with new ideas new thing new ways of thinking new values new capacities within the human heart which generated new social relationships and new social institutions somehow going through this profound Global Systems crisis broke us down broke US Open and tapped us into the universe at a deeper level than we had ever been tapped into before so that when we went through this crisis we were changed profoundly as a species and what came out of this crisis was not just a new civilization or a new economy or a new industry what came out of it was literally a new kind of human being that this is a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche a shift in the fundamental core of the collective psyche now Humanity has been through shifts in the past like this there was a time when we shifted and our brain size increased 50 percent that's enormous shift in it this is something like that it's a it's a deep shift of the collective psyche so that every human being born after this takes place will be living their individual awareness will be alive within a field of a collective awareness which is different than the field that we are in now and today this is what I call the birth of the future human and I think the form that the future human will take will be the diamond Soul we are giving birth to a new species on this planet a species which is spiritually awake a species which is spiritually mature and the species which is a soul-conscious species a soul aware species and by that I mean something beyond anything that we've ever talked about Soul before because I think our restrictions our concept of Soul have been restricted by assumptions we've been making and that's why I call it the diamond soul to signal that this is something new this is something different and I think our great spiritual Masters our great Saints and saviors Jesus the Christ the Buddhas the prophets these have been giving us uh foreshadowing insights into the nature of the being that we are becoming they are the prototypes of the being that we are all becoming and then laid in my and even late in my journey I was taken deep into deep time and was given my deepest experience of the future human and this being is most magnificent being just an extraordinarily magnificent beautiful being of a vast heart of a mind capable of drinking in deep from the creative intelligence and a heart capable of experiencing the fundamental Oneness of all of life and a being that experiences the fundamental Oneness of Life we've never heard another being not just another human being never heard another being and such a being would build a different world than the world we're building now so such a being need to evolve well I think this is simply the next step in our evolutionary Saga I don't know how long it's going to take for this transition to be affected I truly don't I mean I think it'll be at least generations whether it'll be something that will be accomplished in a hundred years or several hundred years I don't know but however long it takes let's say it took a thousand years which I think is stretching it because I think we'll be dead if we don't make this transition sooner than that we are either going to go extinct I think or we're going to transition into this new form Extinction is a tremendous accelerator of evolution near Extinction the threat of Extinction whatever however long it takes whatever we become Evolution isn't going to stop we've been at this for billions of years we're going we're going to be at this for billions and billions of years more there's no telling where we might be going next and then next after that so I don't see it as an endpoint or a stopping point I see it as simply the next point and the next point is to wake up to who what's been really going on to who we really are to wake up to the depth and breadth of our relationships with life itself and other people and other species and then we continue um it's been 24 years since you stopped do you feel that you have fully integrated all of those experiences no no I haven't when I when I finish my sessions and was beginning the digesting process my meditation in my meditation of the universe said to me 20 years in 20 years out and I thought oh it'll take me 20 years to assimilate 20 years of my journey and as I was getting to the end when I was writing diamonds from heaven I thought that was probably an optimistic assessment I think it'll take me many lifetimes to fully integrate all the the gifts that I've been given what do you think in the light of what you've told us what you've learned what you've seen we most urgently need to address now as a species boy there's so many layers to that question I think first we start by taking full responsibility for our shadow for engaging our shadow and clearing any obstacles and blocks which are impeding uh our compassion which are uh impeding our healthy whole cycle spiritual functioning we need to reconnect and ReDiscover our relationship with the universe and our fundamental core identity with the universe we need to overcome all these several thousand years now of teaching which places Humanity at the top of the evolutionary pyramid and it's being unique and kind and not just unique in degree but unique and kind and Superior to all other life forms and all other life forms serve us and can be used exploitatively by US all that has to be transcended and we have to enter into a renewed communion with the universe with spiritual reality and with physical reality I think we need to to recognize that our body is divine not just our mind and our heart but our body is part of the manifestation of divinity SRI arbindo thought that Humanity eventually would become so spiritually energized that the body was sufficiently psychoplastic that the body had the capacity to live forever he said his calculation would was that it would take 300 years of spiritual practice before we would reach the point where we could set in motion the chain reaction that would have our biological body perpetually refreshing itself as we live in communion with divinity now I I don't know about that but I find it to be an intriguing vision from a profound teacher about the potential that we're activating what's important is to realize we are we're just children waking up in the garden that's been underway being developed for billions of years we just are beginning to wake up to what's going on to who we are to what's happening we really are like children in the in the playpen but where I think we're about to get out of the playpen I think we're about to walk I think we're about to become uh mature adults [Music] um that there is an urgent need to get psychedelics back on the table um so that they're um efficacy can be proven and we can start adopting them as a way of helping people to um you know heal their wounds and hopefully evolve even more quickly yeah I think so I think there are very valuable substance unfortunately we are reclaiming them after our 40-year interruption because these are amplifiers of Consciousness everything hinges on how we use those hours of amplification if we use those hours of amplification carefully and wisely then these these substances can help us heal the wounds of life we can go deeper than that these substances can help us recover the insides of our true nature of our essential nature of our fundamental core identity with all other life forms they open up spiritual uh platforms within a I think that psychedelics have a profound philosophical significance this is a different way of doing philosophy where we systematically temporarily expand our mind and then come back and then write it down and then analyze and crunch our experiences and compare them to other people's experiences one person's experiences are are never important and by themselves it's when we get many many people's experiences and put them all on the table together and begin to find out where the common ground is what are the common themes that emerge that's where we begin to develop a truly trustable uh epistemology a trustable set of insights into what's going on so I think these are enormously valuable they have to be used very carefully they they should be used with great respect when one amplifies one's Consciousness the dirt comes out of the system and if you're not prepared to meet that dirt or you open up under wrong circumstances it can be terrifying you can do dangerous things but if you've taken all the precautions and you open up under the right circumstances there is nothing that comes out that can't be beneficial if you face it with courage and with grounding and with skill and I think we are we are now training the next generation of psychedelic therapists we are training people to help other people use these substances beneficially but of course you know back in the 60s there was a move a lot of people were involved in doing experiments with these to find out how they could be useful to humanity and and they got shut down um are you hopeful that this time we will be able to move forward with this and and find the benefits and allow people to benefit I hope so and that seems to be where we're going the Psychedelic Renaissance is really focused on personal healing and uh by treating the conditions that are generated by modern culture post-traumatic stress disorder depression uh addiction death anxiety we're using scientific methodologies and carefully frame studies in order to document The Beneficial effect of these substances now once we do that once we establish them and bring them back as legitimate subjects for discussion in scientific and just educated Society then I think we'll be going into the next second and third levels where we'll begin to realize that these capacities these substances not only heal have the capacity to heal but they have the capacity to reveal to open to a lumen now civilizations have known indigenous peoples have known this for Millennia Ayahuasca is used in South America going back at least 1500 years peyote masculine mushrooms indigenous people have been using these substances to open up spiritual communion for Millennia we're catching up and and so therefore the indigenous people really are our teachers and how to use these substances wisely do you ever wonder why you why did you have this experience and not someone else foreign have used these substances wisely and have had these and types of these experiences so I'm just a representative of a whole social movement and maybe I pushed the edge harder than most and maybe I because of my training maybe I wrote it down and and analyzed it and kind of worked out the details more than most but I don't see myself as unique in any way I see myself as part of a social movement uh when I got out of graduate school and I met Stan Groff's work as soon as I met his work I said I knew this was my work this was my calling it was just it woke up inside why that was the case eventually it really came back to decisions that were made when I was in the Bardot before I incarnated what my soul's work was going to be and my soul's work really was very much around education and very much around healing but not psychotherapeutic healing one-on-one but really engaging healing at a very deep Collective level and I think that there are many many people working at this level I think there are many hidden Saints working to bring about the birth of the future human I think there are many bodhisattvas in the world some of them are recognized and most of them are not recognized but who really are they invest their life in bringing about the transformation of the lives of others of helping others and helping us make it through this crisis of that we are entering into the Global Systems crisis the ecological Christ assisted bearing down on us it's going to take all of us I think all of us chose to be here at the time and the form that we incarnated I think there are no victims there are no there is no compulsion and reincarnation we all chose to enter this time in history we we may not remember why but we chose to be here we chose to be part of this process thank you thank you for joining us and sharing your incredible journey and thank you for sharing it with the world thank you Sandy it's been my honor and pleasure to be in discussion with

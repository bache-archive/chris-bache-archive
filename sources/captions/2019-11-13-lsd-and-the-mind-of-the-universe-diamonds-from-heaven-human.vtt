excited to present our guest speaker for today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.960
Chris Bache who's going to be presenting on his&nbsp;
forthcoming book LSD and The Mind of the Universe:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.520
Diamonds from Heaven released this November 26.&nbsp;
You can pre-order your copy today through Amazon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:23.000
Up until the 1700s humans believed that the&nbsp;
edge of our universe ended at the planet Saturn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.620
the last visible planet that we can see with the&nbsp;
unaided eye with the invention of the telescope we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.250
turned it to the heavens and to our great surprise&nbsp;
we discovered the planet Uranus twice as far out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.660
as the planet Saturn our universe doubled in size&nbsp;
then in the 1800s with the discovery of Neptune&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:53.750
our universe once again doubled in size then in&nbsp;
1931 with the discovery of Pluto our universe then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:02.150
again doubled in size and now less than 400 years&nbsp;
later from the discovery of Uranus we have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.360
deep space Hubble telescope which shows us that&nbsp;
there are trillions upon trillions of galaxies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.000
in our universe for me this is analogous to the&nbsp;
work that Chris has done and his deep exploration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.870
of consciousness radically breaking open and&nbsp;
through our cosmology and our philosophy and our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.520
metaphysics through the 73 high dose LSD sessions&nbsp;
that he did it over 20 years and began to share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.950
with us in his work dark night early dawn steps&nbsp;
to a deep ecology of mind now with LSD and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.790
mind of the universe Chris takes us further into&nbsp;
Diamond luminosity and brings back the diamonds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.140
from heaven that he so graciously shares with&nbsp;
all of us here today there couldn't be a more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.470
important time for Chris to share his work with&nbsp;
all of us both in the greater understanding and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.240
acceptance of psychedelics today but also because&nbsp;
of the psycho spiritual death and rebirth that our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.740
collective human species seems to be going through&nbsp;
right now so please help me give a very warm and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.840
loving welcome to our beloved friend Chris Bosh&nbsp;
and when Chris is done speaking you each have an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.550
opportunity to ask your questions so please&nbsp;
have those ready as that is our favorite and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.260
those special part of these live streams thank you&nbsp;
so much for being with us here today hi everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.810
Thank You Jessica and Travis thank you for this&nbsp;
opportunity to share my work with participants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.030
intrapsychic aam it is truly an honor to do so&nbsp;
it's also an overwhelming task because this book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.180
covers so many dimensions of consciousness&nbsp;
it covers so many years of work and when I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.970
talk about it I have a tendency to get absorbed&nbsp;
naturally into the experience as I'm describing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.460
and that makes compressing 20 years of work and&nbsp;
20 years of thinking and writing into a very short&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:19.010
presentation really challenging so to me a talk&nbsp;
is the most effective way to get to question and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:26.030
answers so I'll try to keep this contained and&nbsp;
as brief as I can and then save a good half hour&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.930
at the end for Q&amp;A and we'll see where that goes&nbsp;
maybe even more than a half an hour so I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.500
to start with a little bit of background first&nbsp;
of all those are you who know me and some of you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.320
don't know me the last person you would expect to&nbsp;
have written a book on psychedelics I was raised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.890
in the deep south in Mississippi I was raised&nbsp;
in a middle-class Catholic background I wanted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.590
to be a salmon priest early in my life was in the&nbsp;
seminary for three years in high school I studied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.320
theology at Notre Dame New Testament criticism at&nbsp;
Cambridge and then philosophy of religion at Brown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.910
by the time I had finished graduate school I was&nbsp;
a atheistic Lee inclined agnostic and the 60s had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:18.440
completely passed me by I was not psychedelically&nbsp;
involved in in my college or graduate school at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.760
all so I was naive psychedelically and I was an&nbsp;
atheistic Lee inclined agnostic philosophically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:35.000
and then came Ellis team shortly after beginning&nbsp;
my career I met the work of Stan Grof and that set&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.840
my life on the course that I'm still harvesting&nbsp;
today so first let me start a PowerPoint that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.670
I'll be using and then I'm gonna keep this on&nbsp;
only for about 10 minutes and then I'll shift&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:57.980
in and out of it again later let me see if I can&nbsp;
get this started here this is what the book will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.680
look like and I'll tell you a secret about this&nbsp;
book this is the publishers title LSD in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.320
mind of the universe my title is diamonds from&nbsp;
heaven because diamonds from heaven is a story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.620
of a journey what they wanted a more marketable&nbsp;
title and that's LSD in the mind of the universe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.350
the beginning of this book goes back 40 years&nbsp;
over 40 years when I had begun graduate school&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:28.040
in 78 right then I met the work of stanislav&nbsp;
grof his book realms of the human unconscious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:34.910
turned my life around followed quickly by LSD&nbsp;
psychotherapy he gave me the method and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.550
confidence to pursue the method of exploring my&nbsp;
consciousness and through that exploration to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:47.360
come to know the deep psyche the deep universe&nbsp;
better I want to emphasize that I did this work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.270
as a philosopher I was not a therapist I was not&nbsp;
primarily seeking healing though healing did come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.060
but I was seeking to understand our universe as&nbsp;
deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.760
as deeply as I could so a few observations&nbsp;
on method and then we'll kind of go right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:13.280
into the content everyone is aware I think of the&nbsp;
distinction between low-dose psycholytic therapy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:21.170
that stand develops and high-dose psychedelic&nbsp;
therapy low dose psychedelic therapy peels the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:28.040
mind gradually layer by layer in very intense&nbsp;
therapeutic encounters psychedelic therapy is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.410
a very different protocol it's a protocol trying&nbsp;
to trick her in the early days who are trying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.870
trigger a near-death experience for people who&nbsp;
had terminal cancer they were trying to heal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:44.210
them but to trigger an encounter with the universe&nbsp;
that would open them to the world that they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:54.080
about to enter when I began my own work I chose&nbsp;
to work with high doses of LSD primarily because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.510
it was simply difficult to get time to arrange&nbsp;
a day of inter journeying with the dual-career&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:06.230
marriage and I wanted to make the most out of&nbsp;
every day that I could put into this I thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.750
of myself as basically doing an extended regimen&nbsp;
of psychedelic therapy doing just psychedelic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.840
therapy but for a longer period of time originally&nbsp;
psychedelic therapy was limited to a maximum of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.060
three sessions and I thought well you could&nbsp;
do three sessions with this work safely you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:29.840
could do it more sessions and do it safely when&nbsp;
I got to the end of this journey and was looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:36.410
back over sláinte I began to appreciate that what&nbsp;
happened in my work was different than what I saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:43.520
being recorded reported in psychedelic therapy so&nbsp;
different that I thought it needed a new kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:51.110
language to describe it so I've chosen the term&nbsp;
psychedelic exploration psychedelic exploration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:59.660
is the method of psychedelic therapy isolation&nbsp;
earphones had headphones music total protection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:08.570
with the sitter the difference is the number of&nbsp;
sessions involved in my case 73 high-dose sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:19.130
between 1979 and 1999 I worked for four years I&nbsp;
stopped for six years for reasons that I described&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:26.270
in the book and then I resumed for a very intense&nbsp;
10-year process I did this work between when I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:34.190
was thirty and fifty years old I'm now 70 years&nbsp;
old so I've taken a long time to present this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:39.560
work completely candidly to the world partly&nbsp;
for legal reasons and partly because it simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.200
takes a long time it took me a long time to map&nbsp;
and understand all the dynamics of the sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:56.060
that unfolded during these years I want to say&nbsp;
at the outset that this is not a methodology that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:03.290
I would recommend today if I were doing it over&nbsp;
again I would be gentler on myself I would take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:09.770
a slower process of engaging the great expanse of&nbsp;
the mind of the universe I would balance high-dose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:16.580
work with low dose sessions I would also balance&nbsp;
working with LSD with working with psilocybin and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:23.030
ayahuasca more body grounded psychedelics for&nbsp;
a variety of reasons all of which I discuss in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:29.750
the book don't have time to go into here I tried&nbsp;
to do this work as systematically and rigorously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:38.180
as I can working as a philosopher I made it a high&nbsp;
priority to make a complete and phenomenologically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:45.440
accurate record of my sessions within 24 hours and&nbsp;
then studied the sessions and the dynamics arcing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.020
across sessions and comparing my experiences&nbsp;
to those who were that had been had by other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:58.940
psychedelic journey errs this is a snapshot of&nbsp;
my journal about 400 pages my psychedelic notes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:07.100
that for me are my personal Bible they are the&nbsp;
record of my deepest experiences of the universe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:15.140
and therefore in my life they come before all&nbsp;
other discursive thinking and analytic analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:23.450
kept detailed records of my sessions all the way&nbsp;
through I looked at and studied the astrological&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:31.190
transits of my sessions trying I was aware of&nbsp;
Rick and Stan's thinking about the relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:37.130
between the outer transits the outer planets and&nbsp;
the global transits and how they affect one's work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:45.050
in deep non-ordinary states so I wanted to study&nbsp;
this hypothesis myself and look at how my sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:54.380
projected against the rhythms of the solar system&nbsp;
during the years I was doing this work I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.020
emphasize that the story I'm telling in LSD&nbsp;
in the mind of the universe is not primarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:06.770
a personal story I mean it is a personal story at&nbsp;
one level but in another sense it's not primarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:15.140
a personal story this series of curves represents&nbsp;
a series of LSD sessions and I found that after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:23.930
the first 15 sessions or so when I was working&nbsp;
insights and help in my personal life tended to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:29.150
come at the beginning and end of my sessions as&nbsp;
I was leaving and returning to time-space reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:36.980
that's reflected in these small circles when the&nbsp;
session was in its peak hours represented by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:45.380
large circles I was usually operating beyond curse&nbsp;
my personal reality beyond Chris Bhatia's reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:52.040
not entirely but largely and so the story I'm&nbsp;
telling in LSD in the mind of the universe is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.040 --> 00:13:00.110
the story of what unfolded in those large circles&nbsp;
at the peak hours of my psychedelic sessions this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:06.380
is primarily a cosmological narrative it's&nbsp;
not primarily a therapeutic narrative the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:12.290
details the personal details are important in a&nbsp;
therapeutic not work narrative it's not so much in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:24.110
a cosmological narrative I found when I did this&nbsp;
work that what unfolded in my work was a series&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:31.520
a multiple series of experiences of death and&nbsp;
rebirth that eventually kind of concretize dinh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.970
to this picture the drop below the line that line&nbsp;
is kind of represents the border of time-space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:44.240
the drop below the line is egoic reality our&nbsp;
individual space time consciousness and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.610
first death and rebirth which is the one most&nbsp;
frequently talked about in the literature is ego&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:55.610
death which takes place in that first level when&nbsp;
we make the transition from ordinary consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:01.790
into early trance personal consciousness but if&nbsp;
you continue to work and press the limits of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:07.880
experience I found that there are other deaths&nbsp;
which take place at other levels of consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:16.190
and wife I look Stan Grof in using the vocabulary&nbsp;
of psychic subtle and causal reality to describe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:22.400
some of these deeper levels of consciousness&nbsp;
I don't have a vested interest in how many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.250
levels of reality there might be or how many&nbsp;
times the circle of death and rebirth may turn

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:36.710
what's important is the principle that if&nbsp;
s one pushes deeper and deeper and deeper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:41.960
if you do this work systematically&nbsp;
there are a series of deaths and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.450
rebirths that open in the process&nbsp;
as I have looked back and mapped

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:54.620
these circles oversimplify of course these&nbsp;
are a number of sessions and what is shown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:01.760
here is the sort of circles within circles the&nbsp;
deaths within deaths that mark a deepening of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:13.910
progressive deepening into causal level reality so&nbsp;
yeah circles within circles when I looked over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:22.850
entirety of all of my psychedelic work identified&nbsp;
five fundamental death rebirth processes or levels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:29.240
of consciousness where death and rebirth were&nbsp;
operating these are the five levels first the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:37.610
death of self by which I mean the death of our&nbsp;
time-space identity as our individual identity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:44.690
as our sense of who and what we are moving into&nbsp;
collective mind there are three chapters in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:53.600
book dealing with the dynamics of collective mind&nbsp;
the ocean of suffering deep time then archetype&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.600 --> 00:16:00.440
Lamine experiences that the high archetypal&nbsp;
level experienced it the Lord archetypal level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:08.840
followed by immersion in causal oneness oneness&nbsp;
services of course much earlier in the sequence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:17.120
but there is something quite distinctive about&nbsp;
causal level oneness and finally the diamond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:25.700
luminosity work after everything that had taken&nbsp;
place before emerging into the diamond light that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:34.400
Buddhism calls dharmakaya I call the diamond&nbsp;
luminosity so let me before turning off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:41.870
power point let me simply take you through&nbsp;
a list of the chapters of LSD in the mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:49.220
of the universe there is a methodology chapter&nbsp;
chapter one but then in terms of the content of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.220 --> 00:17:00.530
the experiences crossing the boundary of birth and&nbsp;
death the ocean of suffering deep time in the soul

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:17.330
initiation into the universe the greater real of&nbsp;
archetypal reality a benediction of blessings the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:29.420
birth of the future human diamond and Manasa&nbsp;
tea and final vision and then there is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:36.560
last chapter coming off the mountain it took me&nbsp;
actually a year just to write that last chapter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.470
that is a chapter in which I reflect on what has&nbsp;
been happening in my life in the 20 years after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:51.230
I stopped my psychedelic work what I'll do is go&nbsp;
through each of these chapters and simply mention&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:57.080
a few points on each of the chapters work through&nbsp;
the list as quickly as I can and then we'll open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:06.210
it up for questions and answers let me keep track&nbsp;
of my time okay first crossing the boundary of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:11.670
life and death is the one that's easiest because&nbsp;
it's most familiar it's so thoroughly described&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:18.510
in stan grof literature when I entered this domain&nbsp;
which took about two and a half years to navigate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:25.770
and ten sessions my work began Sacher became&nbsp;
saturated with confrontations with death fetal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:33.090
sensations all sorts of severe perinatal seizures&nbsp;
a purging of the body eventually culminating in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:40.710
ego death my ego death basically involved a&nbsp;
complete reversal of everything that I knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:48.780
myself to be at the time I was an academic a&nbsp;
white male academic philosopher passionately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:54.150
concerned with the meaning of life I became&nbsp;
the complete opposite of that I became women&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.150 --> 00:19:00.990
women of color women who were not interested in&nbsp;
philosophical reflection at all I became it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:07.530
a frightening experience a terrifying experience&nbsp;
but when I let go when I let go and allowed myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:14.490
to become all these women who were so different&nbsp;
from me I entered the world of women and was given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:20.400
the experience of hundreds and hundreds of women&nbsp;
under the arm with a great mother it was a truly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:28.650
life-changing experience for me and I wish every&nbsp;
man could have that experience when I went into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:37.740
when I went through that death and rebirth process&nbsp;
and went into continued to work I entered into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:47.340
domain of suffering and pain and agony collective&nbsp;
pain and suffering that was so severe I came to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:53.610
call it the ocean of suffering so let me back up&nbsp;
just for a second working at these levels as I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.610 --> 00:20:00.930
did it every session basically had two phases a&nbsp;
first phase which was a purification phase and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:06.330
second phase which was the ecstatic phase the&nbsp;
purification phase would be some type of very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:13.380
profound cathartic purification engagement&nbsp;
and if that was allowed to continue to its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:20.770
culmination there was some type of a breakthrough&nbsp;
and then the recession's pivoted to an ecstatic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:27.910
portion for the remainder of the session when I'm&nbsp;
describing the ocean of suffering I'm describing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:37.900
the purification phase of the next two years of&nbsp;
work tremendous suffering at first I thought this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:43.810
was a deepening of ego death I thought somehow&nbsp;
that pieces of my ego were still in play and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:50.230
this collective suffering represented a deepening&nbsp;
of ego death but eventually this continued for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:56.260
so long and it was so severe that I came to a&nbsp;
different conclusion the conclusion I came to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:04.210
is that somewhere along the line something had&nbsp;
happened in my sessions that these ordeals were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:11.620
not really aimed at my personal transformation&nbsp;
at all that somewhere along the line the focus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:18.550
of my work at this point became actually the&nbsp;
purification and healing of some aspect of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:25.840
collective psyche some aspect of the collective&nbsp;
unconscious but somehow I was tapping into pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.230
and suffering which was lodged in the collective&nbsp;
psyche and by engaging this pain and suffering&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:40.600
consciously it was in some way being lifted out of&nbsp;
the collective psyche and therefore lightening the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:50.860
kind of karmic burden that our species was holding&nbsp;
well I wrote dark night early dawn primarily to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:57.430
understand this whole dynamic primarily to&nbsp;
understand how my sessions how death could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:03.730
become as large as it became in my sessions and by&nbsp;
integrating Rupert Sheldrake's concept of morphic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:11.080
fields into Stan Grof paradigm the way open to&nbsp;
viewing these experiences as part of a larger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:21.760
transformational practice aimed at the collective&nbsp;
psyche in the ecstatic portion of these next these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:29.910
two years of sessions in the ecstatic portion I&nbsp;
entered into what I call deep time in the soul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:37.470
I and I began to have experiences of my life as&nbsp;
a completed whole from start to finish with all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.120
the time moments of my life with all the themes&nbsp;
and all the people in circumstances of my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:50.430
simultaneously present and I was basically taken&nbsp;
into this territory consistently for one year over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:57.870
and over again seven sessions went deeper deeper&nbsp;
and was basically given a profound crash course&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:05.910
and Chris beiges life what it was about who the&nbsp;
people were that I was involved in my life was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:12.810
taken into a kind of a spiritual distillation of&nbsp;
what my life was about and what it was going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:20.490
be about when I first entered this reality and&nbsp;
came out of it after the session it had been the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:26.910
most powerful and transformative experience of&nbsp;
my life and yet I couldn't remember it after the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:33.270
session was over I could not hold on to trance&nbsp;
terrible experiences of this magnitude because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:39.240
there simply was no reference point in my ordinary&nbsp;
consciousness to anchor them but when I went back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:46.170
again and again and again I found that I was able&nbsp;
to hold on to these experiences more effectively I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:51.570
was able to remember them I was able to bring more&nbsp;
and more of them back and this is an important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:57.900
point if you want to enter into these states and&nbsp;
you cultivate systemic recall of the experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:04.110
in these states you have to really work with&nbsp;
a lot of discipline you have to engage them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:11.190
very conscientiously record them conscientiously&nbsp;
and if you hold this position well you literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:17.910
learn how to become how to be stay conscious in&nbsp;
states of consciousness that previously you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:23.070
not able to hold the conscious awareness in and&nbsp;
this pattern repeated every time I would break&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:29.550
through to a new level there was always a period&nbsp;
of disorientation a period of loss of memory but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:36.150
then when I would keep going back over and over&nbsp;
and over again to that new level my cognition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:43.500
improved my perception improved my ability to&nbsp;
understand and record all the experiences improved

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:54.660
now the ocean of suffering work I said lasted&nbsp;
two years and 14 sessions but this was actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:03.060
divided into one year of work and then I took my&nbsp;
six year break and then I started my second Delic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:11.730
work again when I started after my six year break&nbsp;
the ocean of suffering began exactly where it had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:16.890
been in the first year of work so six years&nbsp;
later completely different circumstances in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:22.920
my life completely different expectations and&nbsp;
different astrological conditions nevertheless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:29.910
my sessions began exactly where they had stopped&nbsp;
which is an indication of the the intentionality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:38.640
of the intelligence that's guiding our work when I&nbsp;
started this after the break the ecstatic portion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.890
of the sessions began at a completely different&nbsp;
place the ecstatic portion of the sessions began&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:50.100
in what I came to call initiation into the&nbsp;
universe I was taken systematically by some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:55.620
intelligence that never adopted any form but I&nbsp;
always felt an intelligence that seemed to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:02.370
intent on teaching me how the universe functions&nbsp;
how it operates I was given a crash course in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:13.470
cosmology 101 in this material the initiation&nbsp;
of the universe I should mention I give names&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:19.110
to my sessions I give every session a name the&nbsp;
name reflects the pith content of the session&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:25.920
and I break the session down in bullet points the&nbsp;
names of the sessions that I gave this chapter on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:33.270
initiation the universe these are the sessions&nbsp;
that are discussed in that chapter you and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:40.230
creating was really a crash course in cosmology&nbsp;
the cosmic tour was an extraordinary tour of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:45.540
universe then there was a training session&nbsp;
and I called the Council of Elders a session&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:51.600
which was training me and how to maintain coherent&nbsp;
consciousness as these deeper levels of awareness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.600 --> 00:27:02.610
were opening dying into one was an extraordinary&nbsp;
immersion into oneness the master plan was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:08.280
beginning of a series of visions that I'm going to&nbsp;
come back to later it was a series of initiations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:15.630
into what appeared to be the plan that the&nbsp;
creative intelligence had for the evolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:22.470
of the human species at this point in its history&nbsp;
I know it sounds monstrously arrogant to talk like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:28.020
that but this is simply what happened in the&nbsp;
sessions and then healing the collective wound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:33.720
healing the collective wound was the ocean of&nbsp;
suffering came into a culmination it came into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:41.850
an extraordinary hard to describe I lay it out&nbsp;
of the book as best as I can hard to describe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:49.110
the magnitudes of suffering that one can enter&nbsp;
into in this work and when that work came to its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:57.720
crescendo I was spun from there into archetypal&nbsp;
reality and the ocean of suffering never returned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:03.750
in future sessions there was a lot of work there&nbsp;
was suffering but it was never this collective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:11.940
suffering that seemed to reflect the history of&nbsp;
the human species after the initiation of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:19.770
universe I entered archetypal reality this lasted&nbsp;
about one and a half years and eleven sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:27.120
when I entered archetypal reality I entered a&nbsp;
reality that immediately was recognized as more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:34.770
real than physical reality every time I entered&nbsp;
this level of work I I had the sensation that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:42.900
was entering a reality that was more real more&nbsp;
existentially real than time and space in fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:50.220
it became very disorienting to realize how deluded&nbsp;
and watered-down reality is inside time and space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:59.910
reality when I entered this work my human identity&nbsp;
began to fall away from me I found that we have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:07.080
sense of being human that is deeper than our&nbsp;
sense of being any individual human an ego&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:14.840
is a death of our individual experience of being&nbsp;
human but entering archetypal reality required&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:22.790
that I somehow let go of human experience at a&nbsp;
deeper level and eventually I could no longer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:28.850
fit myself back into any cognitive frame of&nbsp;
reference related to Homo sapiens I entered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:37.430
a level of consciousness that I experiences being&nbsp;
above and beyond human consciousness and there I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:45.440
was systematically worked with and given lessons&nbsp;
on how reality operated there these experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:51.380
kind of broke down and at two different levels at&nbsp;
the high platonic level at the highest level level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:58.550
I encountered beings that were completely beyond&nbsp;
my ability to conceptualize and understand my mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:06.080
imaged them like galaxies there were just vast&nbsp;
beings that were the creators of time and space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:12.230
they were the creators of life on this planet&nbsp;
they were the guardians of existence they were the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:20.750
massive constitutional forces that actually create&nbsp;
everything that we know as times space in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:28.850
magnificent universe at a lower archetypal level&nbsp;
at more of a Jungian level I was taken and given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:35.480
many experiences of the collective consciousness&nbsp;
our collective psyche our collective unconscious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:43.070
and even kind of a collective body that all&nbsp;
of our bodies are cells in I was given many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:49.520
experiences on how the collective psyche works&nbsp;
on how reality functions at this level these all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:56.120
took place primarily at subtle level reality so I&nbsp;
was given exercises and the nuts and bolts of how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:03.350
reality works how our individual Minds ourselves&nbsp;
within a larger mind and even how our individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:11.240
bodies our cells within some kind of fundamental&nbsp;
core archetype of the human body and that when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:19.010
engage and heal diseases in our individual body&nbsp;
we simultaneously are impacting the health of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:37.280
the human families larger body the list of the&nbsp;
sessions that I address in this chapter xxviii&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:44.660
session was an extraordinarily positive session&nbsp;
ecstatic session in which I broke through and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:54.590
touched calls a level reality for the first time&nbsp;
and extremely clear lucid hard to describe state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.590 --> 00:32:02.630
of hyper clarity and then I was quite surprised&nbsp;
to go through three sessions of just gut-wrenching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:11.120
cleansing just on our deal of physical&nbsp;
psychological cleansing that had absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:18.380
no cognitive content associated with it at all&nbsp;
it's just a just a gut-wrenching cleansing in time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:25.220
to make a very long story short I began to realize&nbsp;
that what there is a cycle that I came to call the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:33.650
cycle of purification the cycle of purification&nbsp;
is that every step into a deeper level of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:42.050
consciousness is a step into a higher level of&nbsp;
energy so that when we when I first broke into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:48.710
causal level reality in the 28th session I touched&nbsp;
a reality that was so pure that it triggered a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:55.340
purification process in my being that lasted&nbsp;
three sessions extending over six months and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:02.030
I found that this pattern repeated itself over and&nbsp;
over again as I continued to go deeper every time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:09.080
I broke into a new level of conscious and had that&nbsp;
ecstatic experience of waking up in a deeper level&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:17.810
of reality the following sessions were very very&nbsp;
difficult very much involved in cleansing carrying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:24.860
out the garbage so much so that I began to dread&nbsp;
the sessions that immediately followed the major&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:30.710
breakthrough sessions I should mention here that&nbsp;
one of the things that opened up this level is I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:39.180
began to experience reincarnation as a collective&nbsp;
previously and those of you who know my book on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:44.790
reincarnation life cycles know that the story of&nbsp;
the soul of the story I'm telling of reincarnation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:51.870
there is the story of our individual evolution&nbsp;
directing our individual evolution over many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:58.470
lifetimes reflecting our individual choices and&nbsp;
our individual learning but now I began to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:06.900
experiences of the entire planet entering into a&nbsp;
reincarnation process and I experienced millions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:15.930
of people over time century after century millions&nbsp;
of people incarnated in a way that was integrated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:23.190
that was you not uniform but that was integrated&nbsp;
so that all of our individual karma our individual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:29.940
soul aspirations our individual challenges were&nbsp;
all part of the collective karma collective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:36.600
challenges and our collective development as a&nbsp;
species it was magnificently beautiful to witness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:46.260
this interplay between individual and collective&nbsp;
reincarnation again all of these taking place at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:56.760
the subtle level of reality when one was gauging&nbsp;
the deeper architecture of the universe after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:02.280
spending about 11 months exploring archetypal&nbsp;
reality and at going through this 11 sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:09.270
going through this very quickly I entered what I&nbsp;
came to call the benediction of blessings it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:20.040
a period of extraordinary blessings just given&nbsp;
one massive blessing after another these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:28.770
names of the four sessions that I address in this&nbsp;
chapter the forest was an experience of Shunyata&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:37.170
emptiness of self no self in me no self anywhere&nbsp;
around me an experience of radical and profound&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:45.240
transparency the birth of the diamond soul I&nbsp;
mentioned in a second singing the universal way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:51.640
was an experience of primal void experience&nbsp;
had culminated in the experience of such at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:51.640 --> 00:36:00.160
ananda consciousness being in bliss eventually&nbsp;
moving into a complete void the fertile void&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:07.900
that subsumes and is the origin out of which the&nbsp;
physical university merged Jesus blood was an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:14.890
experience of extraordinary cosmic love love like&nbsp;
I have never known it before just super saturated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:25.030
soul saturated engaging of love the birth of&nbsp;
diamond soul I want to mention because it'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:32.620
come up later in the work in that experience in&nbsp;
the birth of the diamond soul session which was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:40.990
really a deeply moving long-lasting session&nbsp;
for me I began to experience all of my former&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:49.300
lives coming into me very fast very quickly eleven&nbsp;
years before I had experienced my entire life from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:56.110
beginning to end now I began to experience all my&nbsp;
lives coming in and it was like the we're wrapping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:56.110 --> 00:37:05.320
kite string around a spool and at some point this&nbsp;
spool ignited It was as if we hit critical mass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:14.020
and all of these lives fused into a singularity&nbsp;
and when they fuse an extraordinary light broke&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:20.800
out of my chest it was my first contact with what&nbsp;
I later called Diamond light and I think what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:29.380
was being given in this session was an experience&nbsp;
of how reincarnation works and where reincarnation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:36.430
is taking humanity this process of accumulating&nbsp;
more and more experience more and more lives is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:42.130
not simply improving us and making us better&nbsp;
beings one life at a time adding a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:47.980
here a little bit there but eventually we're&nbsp;
collecting experience and I think eventually in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:56.320
the entire human saga all of us are coming into a&nbsp;
stage where eventually all of our knowledge all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:02.060
our experience everything we've ever done everyone&nbsp;
we've ever known through these lives there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:09.920
fusion of that knowledge and when that knowledge&nbsp;
fuses we are catapulted into a higher operational&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.290
status with a different relationship to the&nbsp;
universe a greater transparency to the universe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:21.260
and also a different relationship with everyone&nbsp;
around us because we have been connected to each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:27.260
other for so many lifetimes we have been fathers&nbsp;
mothers enemies friends partners in so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:34.190
lifetimes when we become whole within ourselves&nbsp;
it opens up a depth of compassion to all beings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:46.940
we experience around us and not just human beings&nbsp;
all beings on our planet after the benediction of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:53.240
blessings where the work went next was into&nbsp;
the diamond luminosity work I was completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:53.240 --> 00:39:03.440
existentially satisfied after the the benediction&nbsp;
of blessings work I had given something that I had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:09.920
been asked to give in the ocean of suffering and&nbsp;
I had been repaid and given more in return that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.590
could possibly have imagined but then we went&nbsp;
into the diamond luminosity work but before I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:21.500
begin to tell you about that I want to back step a&nbsp;
little bit and talk about the birth of the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:27.620
human because it's been a reoccurring theme in&nbsp;
my session starting all the way back to the 22nd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:34.070
session all the way through to the end of the&nbsp;
sessions a reoccurring theme is what is happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:41.900
to the human race where are we in our evolutionary&nbsp;
journey now I tell this story in the book I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:52.070
brought together in one place all of the session&nbsp;
material related to the birth of the future human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:58.940
in this one chapter so in the starting with&nbsp;
experiences that first appeared in chapter 6&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:05.390
the initiation of the universe running all the way&nbsp;
through I gathered them all together and collected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:12.800
them into two segments first is a segment that I&nbsp;
call the visions of awakening which are visions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:20.670
that I have been given in different piecemeal&nbsp;
fashion about where we are and where we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:32.130
I break this down into six visions these are the&nbsp;
six themes of our wakening what was most striking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:41.640
to me about this was first how dramatic this&nbsp;
process was and how the experience was that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:49.170
were poised to move into an evolutionary to make&nbsp;
an evolutionary jump that would completely propel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:56.760
us into a higher order of functioning not only as&nbsp;
individuals but as a species we are poised on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:04.590
edge of a profound Great Awakening but in all of&nbsp;
these visions and I'm going so fast I hate to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:11.010
so fast through them but in all of these visions&nbsp;
I and which kept pointing to an awakening taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:17.640
place on the planet of the human species of the&nbsp;
entire species the consciousness of our universe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:24.960
was actually trying to awaken the entire human&nbsp;
species I was not shown how this was going to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:32.130
place I was not shown how this was even possible&nbsp;
and then about a year and a half after the last&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:38.520
of the visions of awakening I was given a session&nbsp;
right in the middle of the diamond luminosity work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:45.840
I had entered the diamond luminosity in sessions&nbsp;
45 and 50 I would enter it again later in sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:56.310
60 and 66 right in the middle I was taken into the&nbsp;
deep time of our species I was given an experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:56.310 --> 00:42:04.080
of tape being taken right into the center of the&nbsp;
Great Awakening that we are coming into and there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:11.670
I experienced this transformation not as an&nbsp;
individual human being my boundaries had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:20.070
opened so many times in the years preceding that&nbsp;
I experienced the Great Awakening as our species&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:27.250
I was taken inside the collective psyche and was&nbsp;
given an experience of what will be happening from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:35.980
the perspective of the collective unconscious&nbsp;
my experience there was that for there to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:43.150
a Great Awakening of this magnitude there must&nbsp;
first take place a great death a great surrender&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:50.950
we must be purged and emptied of all our old&nbsp;
ways of thinking and feeling before the space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:57.430
is created to allow awakening of a higher order&nbsp;
of knowing so that the time of great awakening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:06.520
was preceded by a time of great breakdown loss of&nbsp;
control literally an unraveling of life as we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:12.820
it just as in a psychedelic session one must let&nbsp;
go of everything and experience a profound death&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:20.170
before great visions open likewise for our species&nbsp;
we must let go of everything that has dominated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:25.360
our past all the constrictions of our thinking the&nbsp;
constrictions of our mind and the constrictions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:35.410
of our heart in order to open to this new future&nbsp;
which is coming there is a third segment on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:45.160
birth of the future human and that came later in&nbsp;
the chapter on the final vision I want to say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.930
my visions didn't tell me how this was going to&nbsp;
take place they didn't tell me when it was going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:55.420
to take place and didn't give me any information&nbsp;
about the details it took me inside the collective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:01.450
psyche and gave me an experience of the collective&nbsp;
psyches experience of this and it also gave me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:07.390
an understanding and experience of some of the&nbsp;
mechanisms that are involved at the collective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:13.060
level that will help us move make this huge&nbsp;
transition we are trying to make in the little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:20.260
time that we have to make it I discussed this&nbsp;
I present this I discussed it in darknet early&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:29.860
dawn and I lay it out again in LSD in the mind&nbsp;
of the universe the diamond luminosity material

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:39.760
as I said before after the benediction of&nbsp;
blessings I had no idea where the work was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:45.550
going to go I was completely existentially&nbsp;
satisfied I had thought I had been drawn deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:51.580
into the cosmic process I had been overwhelmed&nbsp;
with cosmic love I had been taken into the fertile&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:58.810
void underneath all physical existence I had no&nbsp;
idea where things would go but there were still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:06.310
five years ahead on the journey and the diamond&nbsp;
luminosity kevlars four years of the work and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:13.780
26 sessions it's by far covers more sessions than&nbsp;
any other chapter in the book and a longer period&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:22.570
of time what happened was after going through yet&nbsp;
one more very intense death and rebirth process I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:34.330
was taken into a reality a level of consciousness&nbsp;
that was well Buddhism calls it dharmakaya the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:40.660
clear light of absolute love absolute reality&nbsp;
I was taken in a domain of consciousness that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:50.680
was absolute pure light the most striking thing&nbsp;
about the experience was how clear clear clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:58.360
beyond imagination this domain was just to touch&nbsp;
this for a few minutes was life transforming in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:05.530
and of itself absolutely clear clear beyond the&nbsp;
species mind beyond archetypal reality beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:13.870
physical any derivative of physical consciousness&nbsp;
into this hyper clear celestial state over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:21.790
next four years I entered this reality four&nbsp;
times and only four times out of 26 sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:29.560
only four of them took me deep into this reality&nbsp;
here are the names of the sessions death state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:39.430
diamond luminosity the universal field of light&nbsp;
in the nature of mind in between these sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:48.340
as you might imagine there were many sessions of&nbsp;
continuing intense purification because this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:55.090
a deeper level of reality of much more pure level&nbsp;
of reality and that required the purification of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:55.090 --> 00:47:01.180
my physical and psychological system in order&nbsp;
to stabilize consciousness at this reality they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:08.020
also scattered in these sessions it was a great&nbsp;
deal of personal healing that took place which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:13.270
kind of curious to me because I would have thought&nbsp;
that personal healing would have taken place much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:22.210
earlier in the journey but it took place here and&nbsp;
I discussed I came to understand why things were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:28.450
unfolding in that order the first two of these&nbsp;
sessions were taking me deeper and deeper into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:35.980
Diamond luminosity which really piqued them in&nbsp;
the 50th session the second two session 60 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:43.540
66 the diamond luminosity was crunching itself&nbsp;
deeper and deeper into my physical system into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:54.250
my psychological system into my physical body as&nbsp;
I said talking about these sessions they're very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:54.250 --> 00:48:01.240
powerful they draw me into them just to try&nbsp;
to describe that the time is short so I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:08.110
to move through and we'll keep going and we can&nbsp;
come back to mend the question-and-answers let&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:17.470
me mention one thing midway through this process&nbsp;
and the 50th session when I went into the deepest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:23.680
transcendent experience I ever had in any of&nbsp;
the sessions into the deepest level of diamond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:31.900
luminosity I was as far into the crystalline&nbsp;
body of God as I had ever been and would ever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:39.070
be and right in the middle of this session I&nbsp;
had an experience that completely changed my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:46.660
understanding of existence in the middle of this&nbsp;
session my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:54.280
saw reality that was far beyond the reality that&nbsp;
I was in inside diamond luminosity and a ray of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:54.280 --> 00:49:01.600
light came out of that distant reality and hit&nbsp;
me and it completely shattered it just I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:11.050
absolutely shattered me and in that experience&nbsp;
I realized that there is no end to this journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:18.070
there is no destiny point at end point that one&nbsp;
eventually reaches that the divine is infinite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:24.640
and will never ever I will never ever be able&nbsp;
to reach even using this powerful method to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:32.140
the absolute ends of that reality now this is&nbsp;
important because I had absorbed and many of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:37.390
us have absorbed the idea that there is an end&nbsp;
point to this journey you become one with God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:42.340
where you enter into the meta cosmic void that&nbsp;
there's an end point and you keep pushing until&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:47.620
you reach that end point and I had experienced&nbsp;
oneness with God but I discovered that there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:53.380
many permutations of oneness there are levels&nbsp;
and levels of oneness and I had experienced the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:59.680
the formless void but I had learned that there&nbsp;
are actually dimensions of formlessness there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:08.770
are depths of born lessness when I when the&nbsp;
diamond luminosity were opened I thought it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:14.890
came with such a profound sense of homecoming it&nbsp;
was so deeply satisfying I thought I had finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:22.600
found my destination I finally found my stopping&nbsp;
point I had found the end of the journey in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:28.930
session session fifty showed me that there are&nbsp;
dimensions beyond even that and I would never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:35.290
ever reach some final standpoint the reason the&nbsp;
death kept returning over and over again in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:40.480
work is if you keep driving yourself and you have&nbsp;
a method that submission would powerful to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:46.300
taking you Pastor then limits the universe will&nbsp;
keep taking you deeper and deeper and deeper into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:53.260
yourself into itself and will never be able to&nbsp;
reach the very end of it and that's why I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:58.600
be gentler with myself if I were doing this&nbsp;
work over again because now I understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:06.250
the goal was not to get to some end state or some&nbsp;
ultimate dimension the goal is to open ourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:12.400
to the trends ascendant realities and let us&nbsp;
much of that spiritual reality into our hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:18.320
and into our minds to let it change us down to the&nbsp;
heart and soul and incorporate as much of it as we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:27.470
possibly can and bring as much of divinity into&nbsp;
time and space as we possibly can and be patient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:34.610
with the rest I'm a little more patient now than&nbsp;
I was when I was a young man doing this work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:43.490
and then this brings me to the final addition&nbsp;
chapter the chapter where yeah I'm gonna take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:49.580
a shortcut here I'll simply say that I was put&nbsp;
through a horrendously powerful stripped-down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:58.400
process and was taken deeper into deep time than&nbsp;
I had ever been taken before and I was given an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:08.300
extraordinarily powerful series of visions about&nbsp;
human evolution and was allowed to experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:16.310
again the future human that we are in the process&nbsp;
of becoming to experience the architecture the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:25.790
inner architecture of the deep psyche of the&nbsp;
future human and this is a magnificent being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:34.010
just to just to think about this being just to&nbsp;
remember the magnitude of this being brings tears&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:41.360
to my eyes it's so important for us to hold on to&nbsp;
the vision of what we are where we are going and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:48.350
what is happening in the deep structure of history&nbsp;
because it's the shadows of our travail deep and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:53.870
as we enter the great time of unraveling as we&nbsp;
enter the purification that we are coming into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:53.870 --> 00:53:01.790
now it's going to be very tempting and there'll&nbsp;
be all sorts of voices talking about Armageddon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:09.410
and apocalypse and the extinction and the end of&nbsp;
times and this is not the end of anything this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:19.760
is the process of giving birth to a new and finer&nbsp;
version of humanity after this the akancha sness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:26.540
guiding my sessions wrapped it up I didn't know&nbsp;
we were stopping but it wrapped it up and took me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:33.140
through two experiences which I called the goodbye&nbsp;
shion's it basically wrapped up all of our work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:41.120
and at the end of the 73rd session I knew that it&nbsp;
was time for me to stop I want to talk about very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:49.010
briefly coming off the mountain overall I think I&nbsp;
did a good job integrating my sessions as I went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:55.190
I paid a lot of attention to my body I took good&nbsp;
care of my body I did a lot of spiritual practice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:55.190 --> 00:54:02.720
I wrote my sessions down carefully I tried to&nbsp;
internalize them as deeply as I could session&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:08.810
by session I think I did a good job of integrating&nbsp;
my sessions and because I had been given so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:15.050
gifts and so many blessings in the course of my 20&nbsp;
years of work I thought that I could simply stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:21.890
my sessions and step back and I would continue&nbsp;
to be nourished by those experiences and I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:28.520
and that did happen but that's not all that's&nbsp;
happened in the years following the ending of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:36.050
my work in 1999 I found myself gradually entering&nbsp;
into a period of what I call the deep sadness a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:49.130
profound existential sadness what I was suffering&nbsp;
from was a loss of communion with the divine I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:56.990
had entered so deeply into the divine so deeply&nbsp;
into the luminous reality of such supreme super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:56.990 --> 00:55:05.870
cosmic reality that I knew I would never enter&nbsp;
that deeply into reality into the divinity again&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:12.050
before I died I knew I was going away I was&nbsp;
setting it aside and coming back in it for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:17.840
variety of reasons to much to go into here I had&nbsp;
to stop my sessions it was important for me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.720
stop them but I knew I would never experience&nbsp;
the divine this deeply again until I died and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:32.630
I would experience it again well when I died&nbsp;
but not being able to return this deeply into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:41.660
divinity became an open heartache for me once&nbsp;
you have been have known the joy of dissolving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:46.820
into the divine light once you have dissolved&nbsp;
completely into the boundary list condition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:54.620
transcending time and space life on earth can&nbsp;
tend to feel kind of dried up and basically I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:54.620 --> 00:56:02.270
was losing interest in continuing to live inside&nbsp;
time and space eventually I realized I was just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:08.120
waiting to die I was taking care of my children&nbsp;
I was taking care of my students and teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:16.430
writing but in my heart of hearts I was waiting&nbsp;
to die so that I could return to my beloved to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:22.880
divine and then years passed and I realized this&nbsp;
is not right this is not the way it's supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:29.750
to be everything about my life was screaming&nbsp;
failure to integrate but because I had tried&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:36.470
to integrate each of my sessions so carefully&nbsp;
and so conscientiously I did not understand work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:42.830
the failure could lie but I had no choice but to&nbsp;
recognize that somewhere along the line something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:52.010
had gone wrong that it would leave me feeling&nbsp;
so existentially adrift in its wake so I turned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:59.360
and studied my work further to try to figure&nbsp;
out what had gone wrong and what I learned was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:07.580
integrating an entire journey is different than&nbsp;
integrating individual sessions then basically

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:24.720
hard to talk about in a matter&nbsp;
of seconds and a half a minute

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:40.710
it's hard to describe the process of in a sense&nbsp;
having too much god it almost sounds like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:47.880
contradiction in terms early more of God is always&nbsp;
better now this entire physical universe is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:54.690
body of God I knew that I know that I'm standing&nbsp;
here and surrounded and part of the body of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:54.690 --> 00:58:00.600
divinity but even that knowledge which had been&nbsp;
given me in my sessions did not save me from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:09.330
consequences but having entered into full divine&nbsp;
presence so many times in time I began to realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:16.800
that I had lost a balance in my sessions and the&nbsp;
balance was between transcendence and imminence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:25.860
I had entered so deeply into transcendent reality&nbsp;
that I had lost my foothold in space-time reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:32.280
transcendence is a magnificent thing it's&nbsp;
very healing to experience transcendence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:39.600
it's very it's very sane making it's very&nbsp;
teaches us what and why we're here but too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:45.960
much transcendence can be disorienting too much&nbsp;
transcendence can actually make you lose contact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:54.810
with another great truth and that is the truth&nbsp;
of our embodied existence I made a completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:54.810 --> 00:59:04.620
strong commitment to reestablishing my presence&nbsp;
inside time and space it took me about 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:11.730
I did it through conscious exercises and I did&nbsp;
it through a sheer commitment to live as I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:19.020
where I was for the my remaining years in this&nbsp;
earth and it took me about about 10 years to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:29.430
really get solidly grounded and operational on&nbsp;
the earth I will say at the same time that I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:36.970
learned to manage my memories of transcendence&nbsp;
my memories of communion but they're always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:43.780
there in the back of my mind they always guide&nbsp;
me in the in the larger trajectory of my life

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:56.680
yes hello thank you very much for sharing this&nbsp;
amazing appearance today you have a I made from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:05.740
Israel I wanted to ask two questions first of all&nbsp;
the about when you say a high dose what is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:16.690
is the what are the doses that we were talking&nbsp;
about yeah yeah okay go ahead and the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:16.690 --> 01:00:21.970
question I wanted to ask about all this all the&nbsp;
setting you know what was the setting cause you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:30.280
know III consumed I do a lot work with with with&nbsp;
plants and I was very interesting to know about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:38.020
the setting how was the setting of the of the of&nbsp;
it of the of the journeys how you did it how you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:42.040
prepared yourself how you did what was in the&nbsp;
moment if you were sitting if you're lying you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:48.850
iced clothes music music nature although these&nbsp;
things and they I would like to know about this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:55.690
and about also about how you were in the daily&nbsp;
life what kind of things helped you to to stay&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:55.690 --> 01:01:02.410
here in a good way like what spiritual practices&nbsp;
or exercise of food or something that was thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:11.260
you very much yeah good questions thank you I'm&nbsp;
worked at 500 to 600 micrograms which is very&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:19.720
high doses of LSD and I mean low dose psychedelic&nbsp;
work maybe one two hundred micrograms this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:27.970
very high levels my setting I was always working&nbsp;
in complete privacy and inside I was either in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:36.490
own house or at my wife's professional office well&nbsp;
I was always lying down I was basically if you if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:43.960
you look at Stan's book LSD psychotherapy you'll&nbsp;
get the protocol laid out in great detail music&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:50.770
was very carefully curated to pace the stages&nbsp;
of the opening and closing of the session always&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:56.950
wearing eye shades not really and the only way of&nbsp;
my sitter would be in communication with me was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:56.950 --> 01:02:04.840
primarily through the music she took care of my&nbsp;
body and took care of the music and so I was not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:15.250
in nature mm-hmm what was the other part of your&nbsp;
oath the grounding practices um really important&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:24.580
you have to maintain grounding is a dynamic&nbsp;
balance my life was very kind of grounded in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:31.240
a schedule in reality first of all was grounded&nbsp;
in relationships was grounded in a long marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:38.770
my first wife 24-year marriage it was grounded&nbsp;
in my roles and responsibilities as a father I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:46.630
have three children so wherever I was on Monday&nbsp;
I was on Saturday I was back in the classroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:57.160
on Monday and I was taking care of my children on&nbsp;
Sunday morning in my teaching a head of a rhythmic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:05.500
a constant set of responsibilities that kept me&nbsp;
always on track always kind of I always grounded&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:13.690
in my responsibilities of teaching my students I&nbsp;
was always doing spiritual practice I was always&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:19.630
doing a form of meditation I encorte did different&nbsp;
types of meditation over the years but I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:27.070
always meditating took care of my body doing yoga&nbsp;
various physical practices it's really important&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:34.420
to stay in lively contact with one's physical&nbsp;
world while doing this work so basically we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:42.280
just blowing consciousness out to its farthest&nbsp;
limits and then it spontaneously Rican jails and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:52.390
I found that myself I had a seemingly a natural&nbsp;
capacity an easy capacity Jessica I can no doubt&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:59.890
explain in my chart the markers of that yeah a&nbsp;
capacity to let loose and let go of boundaries and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:13.030
then to Rican Geel back into my time-space reality&nbsp;
yeah does that cover your questions enough yes yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:18.670
thank you very much so I just left question is&nbsp;
to consume this you always made sure let's say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:24.340
there will be someone like in a distance on the&nbsp;
house or somewhere that it would need you need&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:33.910
assistance or yeah like you always you make sure&nbsp;
that they nobody would be there yes in my is my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:43.330
mic on yes okay yes I was never left alone I was&nbsp;
always taking care of my wife was my sitter she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:51.310
a clinical psychologist my first wife Carol she&nbsp;
was my sitter how she never left me alone and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:57.970
she had complete responsibility for taking care&nbsp;
of our world we were always isolated we were in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:03.520
private there were no interruptions to my work&nbsp;
when I basically closed the door and we entered&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:10.120
this world there was absolutely nothing that was&nbsp;
going to intrude from the outside world I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:15.820
that's really important it's important to have an&nbsp;
absolute clear container I call it entering the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:22.150
Kiva just as in in the southwestern United States&nbsp;
when they would do spiritual practice they crawl&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.830
into the Kiva a hole in the ground they pull up&nbsp;
the ladder and you're isolated completely from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:32.230
the world while you're doing this work if you're&nbsp;
going to go deep into the universes and very very&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:38.080
important to have a completely grounded isolated&nbsp;
protected environment so that you know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:45.520
whatever you're confronting and I've confronted&nbsp;
some pretty horrendously difficult experiences but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.800
whatever you're confronting you know that it's not&nbsp;
coming from outside you it's coming from innocence&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:57.580
from inside you or from in it's coming from the&nbsp;
universe but purely through your own consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:03.370
so no outside complications I did not try to&nbsp;
stay in contact with the outside world at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:12.970
let's hear from Kari go ahead Kari thank you&nbsp;
so much for all your work I've heard you speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:20.650
years ago through PCC and CIS and I've enjoyed&nbsp;
your writings and and many bits but I love this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:25.210
presentation that you did today so coherent and&nbsp;
walking through each of the stages and sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:30.610
and the way you organized the arc of the journey&nbsp;
is really impressive and super-rich so thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:39.190
so much for that thank you three questions you can&nbsp;
pick one if you want if it seems too but the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:47.350
astrological integration I'm really curious about&nbsp;
you know your individual chart your transits how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:52.720
the individual chart kind of functioned as a&nbsp;
lens for you to entering these you know either&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:59.320
subconscious parts of yourself to be able to see&nbsp;
them or the you know the collective unconscious as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:05.470
well all of the parts mmm there and and you know&nbsp;
how much of the of the chart do you think remained&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:13.360
as you entered these less individuated states yeah&nbsp;
one the individual part two the transits any you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.400
know just any little head bits that stick out I&nbsp;
guess and then the third one I'm really curious&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.110
particularly it came up for me when you were&nbsp;
talking about being in the ocean of suffering&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:34.090
and the the healing that can come about from&nbsp;
processing that internally and individually and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:39.670
I'm curious if you if those effects you felt them&nbsp;
in your I'm just gonna call it your waking life&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:46.120
your your normal states of consciousness in if&nbsp;
it kind of came back from people around you or in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:52.090
world events or you know any potent moments where&nbsp;
that where that you really felt that reflection of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:58.330
your internal experience from the external world&nbsp;
yeah let's start on your last question and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:07.180
work forward into the earlier ones yeah it did&nbsp;
manifest there were manifestations that emerged&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:15.370
in the outer world and so let me mention my book&nbsp;
the living classroom and there's a chapter on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:21.640
teaching and dark matter lead on what my I never&nbsp;
talked to my students about my work right I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:30.850
made a firewall between my professional life and&nbsp;
my inner harmonic work and yet I found over time&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:39.580
that various students were being activated by my&nbsp;
inner work though that the deeper I went the more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:46.270
powerful the activation became and it became such&nbsp;
a prominent part of my teaching that I found that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:52.030
I had to I had to understand what was going on&nbsp;
I had to learn how to work with these forces so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:58.510
for me integration doesn't mean simply personal&nbsp;
integration into my personal life but it also&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:06.490
means helping take care of all the derivative&nbsp;
social fallout of one's own experiences I found&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:11.920
for example that while I was teaching and I would&nbsp;
just be reaching to give examples of something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:19.210
I was trying to explain that the examples that I&nbsp;
would reach for would without my even being aware&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:23.470
of it students were coming up after class and they&nbsp;
say you know that's interesting that you use that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:28.870
example because that's exactly what happened to&nbsp;
me this week and this happened over and over again&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:34.840
that there was some kind of boundary which had&nbsp;
come down between my mind and my students mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.720
it was and not only not only were these things&nbsp;
kind of like triggering sort of an aha moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:48.730
from my students isn't that curious you know but&nbsp;
the deeper I went the more these synchronistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:55.660
touches began to trigger very very deep healing&nbsp;
experiences in the students It was as if their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:55.660 --> 01:10:02.200
souls were in communication with my soul and they&nbsp;
were giving me bits and pieces of insights into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:08.290
where they were what they needed where they were&nbsp;
suffering where they were hurting and this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:15.130
happening without me being consciously aware of&nbsp;
the process at all and so I really had to study&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:21.280
this I really had to understand what was what was&nbsp;
driving these processes and eventually I wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:27.640
after dark night early dawn I wrote an entire book&nbsp;
on the living classroom on the collective dynamics&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:33.130
in the classroom and I don't mention psychedelics&nbsp;
there because this is not a psychedelic phenomena&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:40.150
this is simply about the nature of consciousness&nbsp;
at one level we have private mind but just beneath&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:45.940
our private mind mine does not have privacy&nbsp;
there are collective dimensions of mind it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:52.240
like throwing a rock into a lake the ripples&nbsp;
spread out when you do deep deep work the ripples&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:59.080
of that work spread out and touch the lives of&nbsp;
people around you the place where I experienced&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:05.230
this most profoundly was in my classroom because&nbsp;
I was working in a collective context I could see&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:16.330
these ripples coming back at me all the time the&nbsp;
first the issue of astrology and individual and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:22.180
global transits this is a complicated question&nbsp;
and I'm not an astrologer so I want to be very&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:29.350
careful about this I tracked my sessions I used&nbsp;
astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:35.350
Rick tarnis about the correlations between outer&nbsp;
planets and inner experience in psychedelic days&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:45.850
so I I plant my sessions by transits and I also&nbsp;
tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs projected&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:54.400
against the pattern of the planets and I found it&nbsp;
to be a very complicated correlation while there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:03.970
were correlations between my individual transits&nbsp;
and global transits with the unfolding of my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:12.610
psychedelic experience there were also differences&nbsp;
that I wasn't expecting there was a kind of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:18.760
failure to find correspondence for example my&nbsp;
breakthroughs were not always paired with with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:28.540
Uranus all right my my really really intense up&nbsp;
against the wall death in your face experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:35.560
were not a confident we're not marked by Saturn&nbsp;
transits or Saturn global transits or even Pluto&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:45.490
transits and so it was a complicated process when&nbsp;
when my work began to go off the edge of time and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:51.880
space when I began to enter deeper and deeper into&nbsp;
archetypal reality and then beyond archetype of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:51.880 --> 01:13:00.760
reality into dharmakaya or the diamond luminosity&nbsp;
I found what I felt was a kind of a roll-off of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:09.510
astrological variables that the astrology did not&nbsp;
seem my my psychedelic dance did not seem to map&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:17.190
very easily into the astrological dance and I&nbsp;
began to think that there actually might be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:27.420
roll off effect of one's solar dance and one's&nbsp;
session experiences and this continues to be an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:33.720
area of active dialogue for me it's an active&nbsp;
consideration there is an appendix in the book&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:42.630
the last appendix is called pushing the limits of&nbsp;
astrological correspondence and in that chapter&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:49.890
in that appendix I give the dates of all of my&nbsp;
sessions so if one wanted to one can look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:54.690
my natal chart one could look at the sessions&nbsp;
when you look at the correlations or lack of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:59.670
correlations and so forth now I know that that's&nbsp;
not a this not enough sessions given in the book&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:05.400
to really get a definitive answer but I wanted&nbsp;
to support the discussion of the relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:13.530
between astrology astrological transits and global&nbsp;
transits and one's own psychedelic work to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:18.540
that's an open question at this point I know that&nbsp;
there are correlations particularly in the early&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:24.990
stages of one works whether those correlations&nbsp;
continue to be as strong in the late stages of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:34.290
one's work I'm not as convinced I'm okay in terms&nbsp;
of my own chart that gets too complicated you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:40.500
I have a lot of Neptune in my chart I have a lot&nbsp;
of water in my chart I have a Sun square Neptune&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:47.430
with Neptune in the first house so there are a&nbsp;
lot of them I have some other dynamics that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:55.140
was destined to do this type of work you know and&nbsp;
I want to mention the ocean of suffering this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:55.140 --> 01:15:00.270
not something that was forced on me I didn't&nbsp;
understand at the time but this and I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:09.990
think the universe forces any of us into this type&nbsp;
of work this was too too hard too demanding too&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:16.470
difficult for it to have it before so I mean what&nbsp;
I learned over time again is it this is something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:23.309
that I voluntarily took on in this incarnation&nbsp;
it was part of the plan of my incarnation to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:30.030
this work and to do the ocean of suffering work&nbsp;
in particular so I'm the volunteer and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:37.110
we're all when we get into this deep deep muck&nbsp;
that we get into we're volunteers for this work

01:15:37.109 --> 01:15:53.849
awesome thank you so much Pauline amber in Poland&nbsp;
and we are so happy to finally see you live and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:53.850 --> 01:16:04.920
thank you wanted to say how much we appreciated&nbsp;
your call I have a few questions but let's start&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:04.919 --> 01:16:09.719
and let's continue the theme of the ocean of&nbsp;
suffering and where we live in Poland of course&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:18.180
was the site of one of the most horrific events&nbsp;
that happened I would say for centuries which&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:26.790
by which I mean of course the Holocaust yeah&nbsp;
when you had your experience of the ocean of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:35.430
suffering did you experience anything specific&nbsp;
or was the specific information or visions that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:41.910
you had that might have related to something&nbsp;
like this the reason I'm asking this question&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:50.490
is because the event which happened 80 years ago&nbsp;
is so palpable that it's still in the atmosphere&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:57.870
it's still in the collective you can feel it&nbsp;
here in the land and you know it's it's there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:03.540
in the collective for him whether we like it&nbsp;
or not and I was just interested in whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:15.000
in any admissions you actually had a sense&nbsp;
of what happens then yeah I did not go into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:27.900
specifically identifiable historical traumas like&nbsp;
the Holocaust what happened was I basically was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:27.899 --> 01:17:38.590
taken into deeper and deeper and deeper into pain&nbsp;
and fury and chaos and extraordinary suffering&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:44.890
that kept getting larger and larger it wasn't&nbsp;
narrowly focused in any century or any country&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:53.500
or any place it expanded to include hundreds of&nbsp;
thousands millions of people and it expanded to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:59.890
include hundreds of years thousands of years&nbsp;
until eventually my subjective experience was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:06.580
that it included all the human beings and all the&nbsp;
conflicts that emerged in the history of humanity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:13.990
I mean something of that scope so I have no doubt&nbsp;
that trauma like the Holocaust or trauma like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:19.900
extinction of Native Americans and other tribal&nbsp;
conflicts and so on I have no doubt that those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:28.300
were implicitly present in what I was working&nbsp;
with but it it wasn't explicitly present it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:33.940
like to me you know stan has this concept of&nbsp;
a coexistence system of condensed experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:40.840
I think the collective psyche also has these&nbsp;
massive aggregate these balls of collective&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:48.910
experience I call them the the meta matrices&nbsp;
they are they are the the meta coexistence the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:55.030
correct systems of the collective psyche that fuse&nbsp;
multiple historical periods and multiple cultures&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:55.030 --> 01:19:01.660
and multiple people's experience late in this&nbsp;
whole series it became very clear to me was that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:08.890
what I was engaging was memory a living memory of&nbsp;
trauma that was embedded in the collective psyche&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:16.060
I should mention that where I live in Youngstown&nbsp;
Youngstown Ohio we haven't had a Holocaust here&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:23.590
but we have a long history of violence it goes&nbsp;
back to the Native Americans and there were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:30.610
some massacres that took place here there is a&nbsp;
tremendous influx of Eastern European this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:30.610 --> 01:19:37.120
a town that made steel there's there's a lot of&nbsp;
old-world patriarchy a lot of violence against&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:45.820
women a lot of old institutional violence and the&nbsp;
Mafia took over our town for decades they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:54.670
gangland shootings in neighborhood parking lots&nbsp;
my sense is that because the ocean of suffering&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:54.670 --> 01:20:03.460
was on the agenda in my work that I was actually&nbsp;
brought to a place where these poisons run close&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:10.930
to the surface in the collective psyche and&nbsp;
I'm sure that if I were working in Poland or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:16.930
in a place that it would have been more explicit&nbsp;
the historical trauma that you're referring to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:16.930 --> 01:20:27.280
thank you thank you first of all Chris thanks so&nbsp;
much for all your work over the the decades been&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:35.170
a huge fan forever and ever and ever and I'm just&nbsp;
so wonderful and on this ocean of suffering issue&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:39.700
that's been brought up and touched on because&nbsp;
that's kind of like the next stop on the journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:46.690
for a lot of the people out there working your&nbsp;
book dark night early dawn was extremely helpful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:54.520
to patron i we we don't work with LSD we work&nbsp;
with holotropic breathwork which is just another&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:54.520 --> 01:21:00.280
technique in order to connect with these things&nbsp;
and what we had noticed over the years was that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:09.970
there were individuals who under not predictable&nbsp;
circumstances began to contact what seemed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:17.050
be this ocean of suffering it wasn't a past life&nbsp;
which happens often enough but there was thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:23.590
about it and then we realized my goodness people&nbsp;
need some clarity that this is not just a personal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:30.040
stuff that they're saddled with and have to carry&nbsp;
around forever they are in a sense volunteers yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:36.460
and so this was extremely useful and some people&nbsp;
in spiritual emergency that come to us begins&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:42.490
realized oh so I was trying to solve the basic&nbsp;
problem between men and women for the last five&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:49.720
thousand years okay well you know I've got other&nbsp;
things I've got to do today and so that I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:56.110
thank you very much for that and it's clear now&nbsp;
how this network will make more available to many&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:56.110 --> 01:22:02.390
more people whatever techniques to work at even&nbsp;
with spontaneous experiences and what we developed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:08.480
was using systemic constellation work then to do a&nbsp;
constellation for the individual that is caught in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:14.420
this that would say okay here's the representative&nbsp;
for the part of the man woman's story that's mine&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:19.910
and here's a representative for the part of the&nbsp;
man woman's story that hmm you know that's a great&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:31.040
big thing and then to let this this clarity Wow&nbsp;
I do have work to do we all have work to do and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:42.290
there's something else going on yeah and and so&nbsp;
I just want to thank you for the earlier work I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:57.500
so glad to see this thank all the powers that&nbsp;
living breathing so I'm looking forward to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:06.920
stage and our workshops in which the the comments&nbsp;
about the other other stages of the past becomes

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:17.570
thank you I I completely agree and I think as&nbsp;
we go deeper into this historical crisis that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:22.340
we've entered I think we're entering into a&nbsp;
collective dark night of the soul it seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:29.990
like there's a profound detoxification taking&nbsp;
place that the poisons of history are coming out&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:35.330
of our collective pores maybe we see it if we&nbsp;
look around us in body politic but it's coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:41.390
out of our pores and it's coming up underneath&nbsp;
us and flooding so that if we're interested in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:46.820
doing purifying work if we're interested in&nbsp;
doing transformational work when we open we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:52.820
open it if we have a technique that's powerful&nbsp;
enough like holotropic breathwork we open at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:58.790
an individual level and then we open at these&nbsp;
deeper levels now I'm not a therapist but if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:03.830
I were a therapist and if I were working with&nbsp;
people entering these states I think just what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:09.620
you're describing differentiating different&nbsp;
levels of the work that emerges recognizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:15.030
kind of what is mine personally and what is&nbsp;
not mine personally but mine collectively&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:22.650
it's important to have closure and to be able to&nbsp;
close these collective levels and there would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:29.760
I would think an importance of kind of widening&nbsp;
those sessions down and kind of concretizing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:37.470
collective work in contrast and separate from&nbsp;
one's individual work now I will say that I

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:50.250
went into this work voluntarily I stayed into&nbsp;
it voluntarily and I am infinitely glad for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:57.120
just personal reasons let alone the collective&nbsp;
reasons I am personally very glad to have done&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:05.490
this work because the rewards that came were&nbsp;
not simply a karmic paying back but when one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:05.490 --> 01:25:13.470
opens and embraces one's life as a member of the&nbsp;
species when one's open to the species and takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:20.640
responsibility for the pain and suffering of the&nbsp;
species it sets in motion not only a healing of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:27.390
that species but there is a tremendous infusion&nbsp;
of light that enters into the collective psyche&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:35.640
and into your psyche as it enters into the&nbsp;
collective psyche and so I have been so deeply&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:42.090
rewarded more than amply compensated for the&nbsp;
work that I did in the ocean of suffering and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:47.970
other levels and I think that this is true for&nbsp;
other people too that when we give deeply and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:54.270
generously to those around us sooner or later&nbsp;
we don't know when how or where but sooner or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:54.270 --> 01:26:00.030
later there is a deep fruition that comes up&nbsp;
underneath us that carries us individually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:07.080
where the universe is intent on carrying the&nbsp;
human species as a collective and that is into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:13.620
this birth of this profoundly new quality of&nbsp;
consciousness that I'm calling the diamond&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:24.210
soul or the future human thank you so much Chris&nbsp;
as Kerry said that was such a beautifully laid&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:24.210 --> 01:26:30.850
out coherent arc and I'm so April for the time&nbsp;
that you have spent with us today and for all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:38.680

thank you so much for uniting today in both our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:46.030

much love and infinite blessings on your journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:51.850
as you deepen into your own explorations&nbsp;
and the healings that we're all here doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:57.280
right now today in this world thank you so&nbsp;
much be well and we will see you next time

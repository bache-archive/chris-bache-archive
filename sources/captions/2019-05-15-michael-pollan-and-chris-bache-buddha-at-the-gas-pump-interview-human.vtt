00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Welcome to Buddha at the Gas Pump. My name is Rick Archer.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Buddha at the Gas Pump is an ongoing series of interviews with spiritually awakening people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I've done over 500 of them now, and if this is new to you and you'd like to check out previous ones,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
please go to www.batgap.com, B-A-T-G-A-P, where you'll find all the previous ones.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Look under the past interviews menu and you'll find all the previous ones organized in several different ways.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This program is made possible by the support of appreciative listeners and viewers.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So, if you appreciate it and would like to support it in any amount,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000

and there's a donations page for people who don't like to deal with PayPal.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
My guests today are Michael Pollan and Chris Bache.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll introduce Michael first. Michael is the author of eight books, including How to Change Your Mind. Michael, say something because Chris’ picture is on the screen. Hi Rick, Hi Chris, it’s good to be here. There we go, there’s Michael.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
He is the author of eight books, including How to Change Your Mind, which is the one we are going to be talking about today,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And a number of books about food, including Cooked, Food Rules, In Defense of Food,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and The Botany of Desire, all of which were New York Times best-sellers.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Michael is a longtime contributor to the New York Times Magazine.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He also teaches writing at Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
where he is the John S. and James L. Knight Professor of Science Journalism.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In 2010, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Okay, Chris Bache has been on BatGap before in a panel discussion about five or six years ago.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You go ahead and say something, Chris, so your picture will pop up.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Hi, Rick. Good to be here. Looking forward to our conversation today.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Good, there you go. My software switches back and forth according to who's talking.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Chris is a Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
An award-winning teacher, Chris's work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
especially psychedelic states. Chris has written four books, Life Cycles,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a study of reincarnation in light of contemporary consciousness research, Dark Night, Early Dawn,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
a pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness, and The Living Classroom,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
an exploration of teaching and collective fields of consciousness.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.000
His new book is LSD and the Mind of the Universe, Diamonds from Heaven.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And I didn't show  Michael's book when I mentioned it. Here's a picture of Michael's book, How to Change Your Mind.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000
The subtitle is, "What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression and Transcendence."

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So, it's great to have you guys. I've been really looking forward to this and really enjoying preparing for it,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and there's been a lot of excitement, I think, among the Batgap listeners and viewers.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In fact, I mentioned this interview the other day on some Facebook group.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I mentioned Michael Poland's name and some guy said, "The Food Guy?"

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So, Michael, how did you switch, if you did, from being the food guy to invest into exploring psychedelics?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Well, before I was the food guy, I was kind of the nature guy. I've always been interested.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The reason I got into food is I was very interested in the reciprocal relationship between people,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and particularly plants, but other species in general, and co-evolution.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
In a book you mentioned earlier, The Botany of Desire, I had looked at this whole question of domesticated plants

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and proposed the idea that they manipulate us as much as we manipulate them,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and that a very fine evolutionary strategy for a select group of plants, and this is true for animals too,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
is to figure out, and by that I mean, through trial and error, natural selection or artificial selection,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
how to gratify human desire.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
A big human desire, obviously, is for food, and that's what most domesticated plants have worked on, that strategy.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But beauty is another, and there's a whole bunch of them.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But the one that I found most curious is the plants that thrive by gratifying our desire to change consciousness.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:37.000
In that book, I wrote a long chapter on cannabis, and looking at how it has served the cannabis plant

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to basically, through trial and error, figure out how to engage with the whole receptor network in our brains,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and elsewhere in our body.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I've had this long-standing interest in plant medicines and psychoactive plants,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and I kind of laid that aside while I was doing all this food research for the last several years,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and then stumbled on this new research going on to use psilocybin specifically,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
which I realize is not a plant, but a fungus, a mushroom, to...

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Well, no, technically it's not. It's another kingdom entirely.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Actually, we're more like fungi than we are like plants.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Plants are primary producers. They can take sunlight and make food from it.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We are parasitic on them, and so are mushrooms.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So, we share that in common. We depend on plants' use of photosynthesis.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Anyway, I heard about this research giving psilocybin to people who had terminal cancer,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and that it was helping them deal with the prospect of death or the fear of recurrence.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And this struck me as a very curious thing to do.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
On its face, I didn't see the logic of it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And then I was also, kind of as journalists do, picking up that there was something in the air around psychedelics right now,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and that there was a kind of renewed interest that was very serious from a scientific or philosophical point of view.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And that came... I was at a dinner party with a group of people I didn't know.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It was a long table in a big house, and I heard down at the end of the table this woman who looked to be about  about my age talking about her acid trip.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And I figured she was talking about some college adventure, and then I listened a little closely, and it was a couple of weeks ago.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And here she was, a very prominent developmental psychologist,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000
talking about the insights into the consciousness of children that her new acquaintance with LSD had given her.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And as journalists, we put together a couple of data points, and that was enough to convince me that there's something going on here that I want to look into.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So that's kind of how it happened.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I was also just thrilled to have a new topic as rich as this, I mean, I was a total neophyte when it comes to spiritual matters,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
neuroscientific matters, psychological matters.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So, to me, the great thing about writing books and being a journalist and not a specialist is you get to master whole new topics as an adult, and you get paid to do it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It's kind of a great gig.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Yeah, I kind of feel that way doing this.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Although it's pretty much the same topic, but a different flavor of it every week, and I love just focusing on it.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:38.000
One thing that comes through in your book, Michael, and one thing you just kind of alluded to, is that there's certain intelligence in the plant kingdom,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and specifically in the psychedelic plant kingdom, that they're not just dumb chemicals.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It's almost as if there's a spirit of the plants which has an agenda, which has an initiative, which wants, in some people's estimation,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to foster human evolution by providing themselves to us as means of shifting our consciousness.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Do you want to touch upon that a little bit?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah, I don't think I would go that far, or I haven't had evidence to go that far, that plants are bearing a message and trying to get us to save them or save the planet.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
It could be true, but I don't have evidence of that.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But I have written on plant intelligence, and I'm constantly amazed at what plants can do and how much we underestimate them.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We're learning now that plants have a pretty elaborate communications network, that the trees in a forest convey messages using mycelium,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:49.000
which are the filaments of mushrooms, to send messages to trade nutrients, that the trees in a forest can warn each other when there's a threat.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And when they're told of that threat, they'll actually change their flavor in their leaves to make them less appealing to insects,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
or they'll start producing toxins of various kinds.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Plants have memory. Plants are intelligent. I have no question about that.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It has something to do with how you define intelligence, of course.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000
A basic definition is a problem-solving ability, that their reactions to situations are not simply automatic or instinctual,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
but that they can deal with novel threats in novel ways, and that they can remember things, too.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
There have been some very interesting trials.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Monica Gagliano is a botanist who's demonstrated that plants can remember and store information in a way.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So, I have enormous respect for them.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I think that we have to acknowledge they have a kind of subjectivity, the way we do.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
They're conscious, not in the sense I think we normally mean by that word,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:04.000
which also folds in ideas of self-consciousness and a subjective sense of what it's like to be Chris Bache or Rick Archer or Michael Pollan.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I don't have any reason to believe they have that, but they have a point of view, and they have interests,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and they pursue these in a different way than we do.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And they're conscious in the sense of being aware of their environment and responding appropriately.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
may get into this later, but some say that consciousness is fundamental

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and matter is sort of an epiphenomenon of consciousness rather than the other way around,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that all forms of matter reflect or express consciousness to varying degrees,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
even a stone and obviously way on up the evolutionary ladder.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But let's table that for a little bit later.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So, you overheard this conversation at the dinner party, and so how did you proceed?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I know you proceeded in many cases with a great deal of caution and seriousness.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Collective skepticism.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Locked in, trepidations. You were often unable to sleep the night before a session because you were sort of anxious about what might happen.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
The idea of even having a session came a little later.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
The first thing I did was reach out to an editor at The New Yorker and say, "I've got a really cool story.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I want to write about these trials," interview the people who were going on these psilocybin journeys,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
talk to the scientists, try to understand the neuroscience of it and the psychology.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And to my delight, they were willing to underwrite that project.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So that was the beginning of my investigation, and I wrote a piece for The New Yorker,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:51.000
which came out in February 2015, called "The Trip Treatment," and it's available online for free if you just search that.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And that was a kind of straight-ahead piece of science journalism.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
There was no participatory angle to it.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I don't think they would have published it if there were.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It was all like white coats and scientists and patients, volunteers.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
But the interviews were extraordinary, and the people I met and the kinds of transformative experiences

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that a single psychedelic journey had given them, completely resetting their attitude toward death,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
lifting their fear entirely in many cases.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
You mean cancer patients? - I'm sorry?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Cancer patients. - These are cancer patients, yeah.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
With serious diagnoses.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Some were terminal, some were paralyzed by fear and anxiety at the threat of a recurrence.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But in all ways, they had this, what the doctors call, existential distress.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And they found relief in about 80% of the cases, which is quite remarkable.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And it's a single intervention.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We don't have much like that in psychiatry or palliative care.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We have morphine.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
We give people which dulls their perception and relieves their pain,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
but doesn't help them spiritually deal with the situation they're in.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Tell us some more anecdotes and give us an overview of the research that's taking place.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And it's not only cancer patients, but alcoholics and depressed people.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And so, give us a sort of overview.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
It started with cancer patients, the first kind of clinical applications.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And the reason for that is a couple.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
One is it's a sympathetic group.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The regulators are a little less worried about any potential toxicity in the case of people who have terminal diagnoses.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000
In the same way that people with AIDS, they were willing to give drugs that hadn't been thoroughly vetted yet if people wanted to take them.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So, there was a comfort level, I think, for the regulators and a sympathetic angle for the public in general.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
How could you withhold this from someone who is dying and had tremendous fear,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and here was something that promised to lift it?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:09.000
But since then, since the success of those trials, there have been several others looking at different indications, medical indications.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
An important one that's being worked on now is depression.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And this grew out of the cancer trials in that they saw that depression scores, as the psychologists measured them, had dropped significantly.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And so, the FDA actually encouraged the researchers to, why don't you look at depression more widely, because this is a tremendous problem.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
The tools we have to treat it are very poor.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Rates of depression are rising rapidly.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I think a big question remains is whether depression is one thing.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And if the kind of depression that a cancer patient experiences is similar to the kind of depression of someone who has a general depression or treatment resistant depression for years and years and years.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
The cancer patient's depression is recent very often and has a clearly defined cause.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And that's not true for everyone struggling with depression.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So, we'll see. We'll see if it works.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
There's some evidence that it will.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
There was a trial at Imperial College in London of depressive patients, treatment resistant, I believe they were.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And many of them, most of them, showed significant but short-lived results.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Their depression lifted for a couple of months and then gradually it returned.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Not in all cases, but in most of them.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So, there's encouraging reason to pursue this. And there are two big trials going on right now for depression are about to get started.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000
There have been, as you suggest, trials for addiction in alcoholics and cigarette smokers and cocaine addicts.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
And those in a preliminary way are showing very promising results.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000
And I think that's interesting and may turn out to be, Ithink  behavioral change may be one of the really big applications of psychedelics.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
With that in mind, they're looking at Johns Hopkins, I think, is going to look at eating disorders.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And that's very important because anorexia is actually the hardest psychiatric illness to treat and has the lowest rates of success and the highest mortality of all psychiatric problems.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So, I think if we can make progress on that, it'd be fantastic.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Let's see what else is being tried.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
There was a small trial of obsession, obsessive compulsive disorder, and there'll be more work with that.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
The drugs have been used with high functioning autistic people who have social anxiety.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And that that result has been encouraging also.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So, there's a whole range. And to people who think, how can psychedelic be such a panacea?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I think it's important to note that the kinds of problems it works on or seems to be effective with, have a lot in common.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:08.000
They're all at the end of the spectrum where people's thinking becomes too rigid, too trapped in deep grooves of habit, whether mental habit or behavioral habit.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
People are in these loops, and they can't break out of them.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And what the psychedelics seem to do is a real jolt to the system and gives people the kind of perspective on their lives that can actually break mental habit.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And it needs to be accompanied by lots of therapeutic intervention.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
These aren't people going off and having a psilocybin trip in the woods alone.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
These are guided trips. And I think is a really important distinction.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:53.000
People are very carefully prepared in advance, told what to expect, how to deal with difficulties that will come up if they, you know, because it can be a very, very frightening things can happen, especially if you're if you're facing your mortality.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:02.000
And then during the experience, the guides are with you the whole time in the university trials are usually two guides, a man, and a woman.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And they're not saying very much. It's very noninterventionist. The idea is to basically give you a sense of safety so you can surrender to what can be a very disturbing set of mental events.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And then after the session, you come back usually the next day or in the next couple of days.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And you have what's called an integration session where you tell the therapist what you saw, what happened, what you're puzzled by.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And with the therapist, you try to kind of come to some interpretation of what's happened and figure out how you can take the lessons, the insights of that trip and apply them to the conduct of your life.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Have these therapists usually taken psilocybin themselves so that they have a better idea of what the person is going through?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Well, I can only guess about that because none of them will admit it.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I should hope so.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
But I can see why it would put them at reputational risk for objectivity.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000
People would challenge the studies saying these people are, aficionados of psychedelics.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I have reason to believe that some of them have, but none of them would talk about it on the record.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
A couple would talk about it off the record and some would just simply say no.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:38.000
So, it's hard to believe you wouldn't develop the kind of curiosity I developed, because in the course of doing this research, it became clear to me that I couldn't really understand what these volunteers were going through without having a similar experience myself.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And that then became the more autobiographical part of the book where I engaged with several underground guides because I couldn't get into the above ground trials and work with them to have a very similar experience in a slightly different context.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Your answer to that question brings up a point, which is that since, I guess it was the early 70s when Nixon declared Timothy Leary to be the most dangerous man in America and psychedelic research was clamped down upon, there hasn't really been much going on.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
And now it sounds like it's kind of burgeoning, but is it?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Can anybody anywhere who's qualified study this or is it still like a real trickle compared to what might be taking place?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
The only reason it's trickly at all is that there's no federal funding.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:41.000
All the funding is private money, charitable donations, and luckily there's a lot of visionary people with a lot of dough in this country and they're supporting the work.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
But there's quite a bit of it.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
There are many universities around the country getting interested and getting involved.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000
There are these two depression trials, each are going to have six or eight sites, each of which is a medical school or a university.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
The FDA is not standing in the way.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:09.000
They made a decision way back in '92, because people have been knocking on the door for a long time, that they would treat psychedelics like any other drug.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
And if you could persuade them that there was a good reason for this experiment, they would grant permission and the DEA would grant a license to use it.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:27.000
So, I haven't heard of people, serious researchers, encountering federal obstacles.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
The main obstacle is money.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Okay. Your comment about the commonality of all the types of difficulties which are being addressed with psychedelics being that all these people are too rigid or locked down in their thinking or in their perspective.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I was thinking that as you were leading up to that comment.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:07.000
It seems like psilocybin and some of these other drugs they're using are so different from usual protocols, because most things tend to dull you in one way or another,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Whereas this is a real opening up of your awareness and a radical shift of your perspective.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:24.000
In fact, I think you say many times in your book that a lot of people say, "Wow, that was the most profound experience I ever had in my life, and I don't feel like drinking anymore or smoking cigarettes anymore."

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:34.000
So, it's interesting that there could be such a thing that, with one session would give you such a radically different perspective and shift your behavior permanently.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Yeah, and also other psychiatric drugs essentially deal with symptoms, and you take them every day, perhaps for the rest of your life.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
At great expense.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And these chemicals are in your brain all the time.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Here you've got this one-shot or two-shot intervention.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:59.000
The chemical, which is not very toxic, whether you're talking about psilocybin or LSD, is in your brain for a short amount of time.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
And you are dealing with cures in many cases.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
You're solving the problem because, as you say, you're not dulling the patient.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
You are opening them up.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
And I think we're leaving them from ego consciousness for a period of time.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I think that's probably an important mechanism for how this works.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:32.000
One of the really interesting findings of the research that I cover in the book is, the effort to figure out what's going on in the brain when someone's having a psychedelic experience.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:52.000
And the current thinking is that there's one particular brain network, the default mode network, which is this tightly linked set of structures in the midline that connect the prefrontal cortex to older, deeper areas of memory and emotion in the posterior cingulate cortex.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.000
And this is kind of the orchestrator or conductor of brain activity, this network.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
It is closely associated with the generation of the idea of a self.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And so, it's where self-reflection takes place.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:16.000
It's where time, mental time travel takes place, theory of mind, the ability to impute mental states to others.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:27.000
And what's called autobiographical memory, the faculty by which we take the events, whatever happens in our lives, and tie it into the story we tell ourselves of who we are.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
So, if the ego could be said to have an address, it's probably in this area.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
And this area of the brain is suppressed dramatically.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And this was a big surprise because they thought psychedelics in the brain would just represent a lot of fireworks, you know, an excitation of everything.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
In fact, it's the opposite for this one particular network.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:59.000
And you can correlate a radical down regulation in the default mode network with reported experiences of ego dissolution.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:06.000
When people tell you, on that trip, I just completely, my sense of self was obliterated.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
They will see on the FMRI that their default mode network has been essentially deactivated.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000
So that's a very interesting insight into where that kind of thinking to the extent it has a material manifestation where that's happening.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:35.000
And it may be that the relief from ego consciousness and an overactive default mode network is implicated in a lot of these problems like depression.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:47.000
There is research to suggest that depressed people have an overactive default mode network that's kind of punishing and they can't get out of their heads.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Because the default mode network also lights up when you're mind wandering, when you don't have anything in the world getting your attention.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
It operates in a seesaw relationship with the intentional network, the attentional networks.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:13.000
And so, giving people a vacation from that, that kind of regulatory authority allows lots of other activity to bloom.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:25.000
And there's an illustration in my book that shows it was an attempt to show people how the brain gets rewired during the psilocybin or LSD experience.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:41.000
And in this drawing, around this circle, you get all these different brain networks, the visual cortex or the auditory networks or the networks that direct your physical activities.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:49.000
And suddenly you get all this communication between networks that don't ordinarily communicate with one another.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
And that might explain synesthesia, the phenomenon of being able to see musical notes,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
that perhaps your auditory center is talking directly to your visual cortex without going through the default mode network.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So, the brain is temporarily rewired.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
And we know that brain connections are new ways of thinking.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And if you have them, even temporarily, you can exercise them and make them more salient.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
And it's just a theory, but that's one of the operative theories of what might be going on here,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:34.000
that when you have some profound insight on psychedelics, it may be the product of connecting the dots literally in a new way.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Yeah. A couple of thoughts on that.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
One is that if we think of the brain as a filter or a lens or a receiver of consciousness rather than as a generator of consciousness,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
then what you said about the default mode network shutting down or becoming more quiet

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
would imply perhaps that there's less filtration taking place.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
So whatever consciousness is can shine through more fully,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
and the ancient traditions say that consciousness is bliss in one of its attributes.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000
And so, you can experience very gratifying, fulfilling states if that default mode network is shut down somewhat.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Another little point there is that a lot of the meditation research has shown that there is a remarkable degree of coherence

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.000
between different parts of the brain that are ordinarily not correlated or coherent with one another as measured by EEG.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000
So, frequencies will just sort of line up in synchrony, whereas before they were asynchronous.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:45.000
And also, the meditation research done by people like Judson Brewer, who also has taken fMRI images of experienced meditators while they're meditating,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
those scans look very much like the psychedelic scans.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
He saw that, actually, and was quite struck by the similarities,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000
so that meditation also down-regulates the default mode network, and I think that's really significant.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.000
But your point, too, about opening up the doors of perception, as Huxley called it,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000
when he talked about the reducing valve, it was pretty clear he was talking about the ego.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:26.000
The ego is really what walls us off from whether it's internal, unconscious material, or external sensory information.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:37.000
It is what defends us from being overwhelmed by reality, by being overwhelmed by nature, by being overwhelmed by what's in our unconscious.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:46.000
And those walls come down, I think, during psychedelic experience, and that accounts for the sense of merging that people have.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
So, I think we're talking about a lot of different vocabularies for the same thing.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
I'm using ego and walls, and I know that's very psychodynamic, and you're using a more spiritual vocabulary,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
but I think we're talking about the same thing.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Yeah, I think so. Chris, do you have any questions or comments on what we've been saying so far?

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
I've just been enjoying Michael's presentation a great deal.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:18.000
I'm so deeply appreciative that a person of your caliber, Michael, has done such an excellent job of presenting the history

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
and the issues and the people's lives being touched in this form of therapy.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:31.000
You just opened up the conversation to many people who previously would have just never been willing to have a conversation about psychedelics,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
and you've done such a good job with it.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
You've done it so well, and you capture the personalities involved so well.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I just really appreciate what you've done.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Thank you.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
I was approaching it from outside, obviously, and with a certain naivete and skepticism.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000
There are people with a lot more knowledge and experience in the psychedelic world,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
but they've tended to be in a conversation that takes place within the psychedelic community,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
and I wasn't coming from there.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.000
I also always write for an audience that I don't assume has any interest in the subject.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I'm just much more interested in talking to the general reader and grabbing them by the collar and saying,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000
"Hey, this is really cool. You should read this stuff," whether it's about food or agriculture, all these kind of things.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000
I think that that stance was very useful to me in bringing people into this conversation,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000
and it's been very gratifying to see how many people, whether they're in the therapeutic community or the neuroscience community,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:54.000
have gotten excited in the last year about the potential here and want to get involved as researchers and as people experimenting with psychedelics.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
So, this Renaissance was happening.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
I was reporting on saying that it was already happening,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
but I feel very lucky that I was able to play some role in bringing people into the tent.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Yeah.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000
So we could probably spend an hour going through all the various stages of your exploration with psychedelics

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
and different experiences you had and all that stuff, and all that is covered very well in your book.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:31.000
So, I think what I'd like to do is just ask you a question which came in from someone actually named Suzy Parkinson in Carlsbad, California.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
She asked, "Since your original psychedelic journeys, or as a result of them perhaps,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:44.000
has your belief system or perspective changed, deepened, or taken on a meaning which it didn't previously have?"

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Yeah, it's a great question.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Thank you for posing it.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
My experiences have changed me in various ways.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
I think for the most part, the personality changes are pretty subtle.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
My wife's not here right now, but I would drag her in to say -- to tell you that I've asked her this question

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
because your partner knows you better than anybody else and is very sensitive to any changes.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
And she basically feels that I'm a more open and patient person than I was,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000
and she was very apprehensive when I started getting involved with this, that I might change for the worse.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
She doesn't seem to think I have.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Intellectually, there has been a change.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:33.000
I think my understanding of spirituality has changed and what that means.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
I think it's important to understand you guys work on these issues all the time,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
but I was really kind of spiritually retarded before I started this.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
It's just a part of my life, my mind, that I hadn't developed.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Some people look at body and desire and they think that's a very spiritual take,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
or I talk about food in a very spiritual way and the importance of communion,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000
but I really didn't see myself as spiritual, partly because my understanding of spirituality

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:09.000
was that it existed in opposition to science, skepticism, and that it implied a -- I'm telling you, I was retarded --

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:17.000
but it implied a belief in the supernatural, things beyond the scope of science ever to understand.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.000
And so, I approached it that way, and I was very much a pretty confirmed materialist in my philosophical outline,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
that the laws of nature could explain everything.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
And I realized how limited this was.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:42.000
AndI had, after my psychedelic journeys, and after one in particular where I had a very profound experience of transcending my ego,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
my usual sense of self, and I actually beheld myself dissolving.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
I'm first bursting into a little cloud of Post-it notes.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
That was me, and there was nothing left.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.000
And then another time where I felt myself kind of spread out on the ground like a coat of paint or butter.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:10.000
But a new perspective arose for me to observe this scene, and that was the spooky part,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
and it's the part I still don't understand.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
From what new point of view was I taking in this scene?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
It was an I that wasn't familiar to me.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:32.000
It was an I that was completely fine with what was happening, unburdened, untroubled, disinterested, and reconciled to whatever there was.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
And it was quite profound.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:47.000
And once that sense of self was gone, I was totally open or unprotected, undefended against anything, and then started merging.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
And in this particular instance, I merged with a piece of music.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:04.000
I had had my guide put on this unaccompanied cello suite by Bach No. 2 in D-Major, which is a very sad, beautiful piece of music, and I became it.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
There was no subject-object duality at all.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
I was identical to this music.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:22.000
I could feel Yo-Yo Ma's horsehair on his bow going over my skin, and I was inside this dark well looking out, and the breeze of the vibrations of the music, I could physically feel them.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
It was remarkable.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
And I came out of that.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:35.000
The next day, I went to my guide for integration, and I said, "Well, I've had this experience of complete ego dissolution."

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And she said, "What did you learn from that?"

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
And I said, "Well, that you're not identical to your ego.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
There's another ground on which to stand, but it was a very mysterious other ground."

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And she said, "Well, wasn't that worth the price of admission?"

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
And I said, "Yes, but it was really interesting, but what do you do with it?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Now my ego is back in uniform, back on patrol, and so what good was it?"

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And she said, "Well, you've had a sample of this way of being, and you can cultivate it."

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
And I said, "How?"

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
And she said, "Through meditation, basically."

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:18.000
And like a great many people and a great many American Buddhists, this opened a door into--

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
it made me much more comfortable in the mental space of meditation, and I could navigate it better.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000
And sometimes I do attain that perspective that I had had during that psilocybin trip.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
So, did that make me more spiritual?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
I'm not prepared to conclude that that new perspective that opened up is some transpersonal perspective

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
or some universal consciousness.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
I know that Aldous Huxley, when it happened to him, said that was the mind at large,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
which was something that we tune in that's outside.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I'd be really curious to hear Chris's take on that.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000
I don't know. It could just as easily be another product of my mind that I hadn't experienced before

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
because the damn ego overshadowed it.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:18.000
But I came to see that my understanding of spirituality was faulty because what spirituality is for me

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000
is a powerful connection, an openness, an undefended ability to connect, whether it's to nature,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
which is very important to me, the natural world.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
And during another psychedelic experience, I had the sense of nature being very much alive.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
the leaves in my garden were returning my gaze in some sense.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And it was a beautiful experience. It was really wonderful.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
So, there was the connection to nature that is opened up.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000
And then there is a connection to other people, the feelings of love that so many people report on psychedelics,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
and this powerful connection to other people and the universe in some more general way.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
And so that's what spirituality is now to me.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:11.000
It's opening the gates so you can connect at a very deep level without any screen between you and the other,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
no subject object.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And I learned that the opposite of spiritual, the word spiritual, should not be material as I understood it.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000
It should be egotistica because it really is the ego that stands in the way of those powerful connections

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
and that the ego is the enemy of spiritual development.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
So that was my takeaway. It's not final in any way.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
I think I have a lot more to learn from the experience, and I might come out in a different place.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I'm very curious about, well, Chris, I would be curious to know how you would interpret that experience

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000
of this new perspective opening up on your dissolved self.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Well, as I listen to you speak, I'm reminded of Shunryu Suzuki in his beautiful little book on meditation,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Big Mind, Little Mind.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
And, it's like there's little mind, which is very efficient getting things done.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
It sits at our desks, answers the phone.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And then there's big mind, which is really that dimension of mind, which is just so profoundly larger than,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
other than, and inclusive of little mind.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
It's just a different wavelength of consciousness.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:33.000
And then the question is, of course, all of the meditation traditions agree that there are many, many layers to ego.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
So, you can kind of get clear at one level and get caught in another and clear at that level and get caught in another.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
It's a labyrinth kind of thing.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:48.000
But according to their ways of thinking, it is possible to profoundly quiet, still allow ego to become transparent.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:55.000
And when ego becomes transparent, there's this larger background context surfaces in awareness.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
So that rings true in my experience.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
The question then becomes, okay, if there's little mind and big mind, what is the nature of mind?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Just mind.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
And that opens it.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Then we're off to the races because then we get into a very interesting discussion of what is the nature of consciousness and what is conscious and who can have consciousness and so on and so forth.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
So, let's open.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
What is the nature of mind?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
I know that's a big, fat question.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Yeah, that's a big one.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:47.000
And personally, I don't have a vested interest in specific definitions of consciousness and specific definitions of mind.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000
I'm kind of happy to go where different people want to go with definitions of consciousness per se.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
As long as the definition is open to a complete phenomenology of mind.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Because my background training is in philosophy of religion and phenomenology has been a large part of that.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:23.000
So, I think it's important for us to critically, not naively, but critically look at the broadest body of data that we have for what mind is and how mind manifests and what it can do.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
So, can mind influence the health of the body?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Can mind actually influence physical objects, telekinesis?

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Is there a mind linking between human beings and plants so that there can be a genuine exchange of information at some level?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
That opens, that gets us into the deeper question.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:44:01.000
And then when we go to Aldous Huxley and he goes to mind at large, that's the assertion of an encompassing mind that holds all minds, all sub-minds held within a master kind of intelligence of the universe.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:10.000
I'm comfortable with that concept just because I've had so many experiences of so many dimensions of that mind that I'm comfortable.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
I talk about the creative intelligence of the universe.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
I don't know what to call it.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I don't know what name we should give it and sometimes I'll talk about it as the divine, but I'm not a theist and I'm not a supernaturalist.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
I completely agree with you on that way.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
To me, it's all natural.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
It's all nature.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
It's all part of nature.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And there's nothing about, for me, the study of consciousness, which should be beyond the range of scientific investigation.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:50.000
But I've spent so much time over the many years exploring different aspects of that mind that...

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Using what tools?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Well, my primary tool has been LSD in my explorations.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:05.000
I also have experience with psilocybin and other, and ayahuasca and salvia divinorum.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:15.000
But my primary instrument of exploration was LSD, used in a particular, very specific modality.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
So, should I describe this, Rick?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Should we do this now?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Let me just wrap up a point that Michael made earlier and then let's do it.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Michael was saying that he used to have a sort of aversion to the notion of spirituality because he felt it was anti-scientific.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Excuse me if I didn't express that quite right, but there was some distrust of it because it seemed probably you heard a lot of "woo-woo" things.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Look at it, religion and science have been at each other's throats for a long time.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:54.000
People used to be burned at the stake for believing that the earth wasn't the center of the solar system.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:05.000
And I feel that we've reached a point where science and spirituality can complement each other tremendously.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:14.000
If we take anything that spirituality or any religious tradition has ever proposed or suggested as a hypothesis,

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:24.000
rather than as something that we ought to believe in, then it's something that might be open to experiential investigation.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
And I think Chris will comment on a lot of things he's investigated experientially,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
which might seem extremely hypothetical to the average person.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Some of these things have very far-reaching implications for humanity, for religion, for spirituality.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000
I don't think there's a heck of a lot of value in just believing in something because somebody says you ought to,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
or some tradition says you ought to, or anything.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
I think everything should be open to experiential investigation.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
So that's what the scientific attitude brings to spirituality.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000
On the other hand, spirituality can bring something to science because science doesn't possess the tools

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:11.000
for investigating the subtle realms that spirituality has specialized in, has dealt with.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And LSD is such a tool, although ultimately our human nervous system is such a tool.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000
And throughout the ages I think what mystics have been doing is using that tool and fine-tuning it

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000
and learning how to use it such that they can explore all sorts of subtle dimensions.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:43.000
And, add to human knowledge in ways that modern science couldn't even hope to begin to do at its current stage.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So I just wanted to get that out, and then you go ahead Chris and segue from that.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Well, just a footnote, add a note on to what you said Rick.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
It's one thing to study the quantitative qualities of consciousness

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000
and it's another thing to study the qualitative nature of consciousness.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:11.000
And I think science is extraordinarily good at studying the quantitative nature of consciousness

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
and looking at the various physiological correlations, various states of awareness, so on and so forth.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:22.000
But I think we can study scientifically, if we broaden our methodology of science,

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
we can study the qualitative characteristics of consciousness.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
We do so by controlled experiment.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000
We do so by getting carefully screened different people from different backgrounds, for example,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.000
putting them through the same exploratory regimen, carefully recording their experiences afterwards,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
comparing their experiences across populations.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
we can't put experience under a microscope,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000
but we can use all of our critical skills to study the qualitative nature of experience,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
and then we can start broadening it into cross-cultural and historical analysis.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:11.000
So, I think we can be critical, but being critical is larger than being neurological.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Well, what's interesting to me about consciousness as a subject for scientific exploration

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
is you can't study it without experience.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
There's no other tool, right?

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Phenomenology is the only tool to understand the subjectivity, at least so far.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
And so, I agree.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.000
I think you have to go down that path, and you can do that with a lot of rigor.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
And it's one of the interesting things about the psychedelic work.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
The reports of the volunteers are critically important.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
And sometimes you correlate those reports with what you're seeing on your brain scans,

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
but sometimes you don't need to.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:09.000
But I think a big question is whether there's any real evidence to think that brains don't produce consciousness

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
or that mind precedes matter.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
I think that's a very interesting question.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:24.000
And I went into my own investigations assuming--because that's the consensus among scientists--is that, we don't know how it happens,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000
but we assume that these neurons, these cells, are producing consciousness in some way.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Even though it's very hard to get from cells to that phenomenon.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Nobody has a clue how to do it.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000
That seemed to be the more parsimonious or starting principle.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000
But a lot of people, after experience of psychedelics, come out in a different place.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
I interviewed a guy a few months ago named Mark Gober who wrote a book called "The End to Upside-Down Thinking,"

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
which addresses this very point.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000
And it may seem parsimonious initially that consciousness is just an epiphenomenon of brain functioning,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:13.000
but there are so many anomalies when you look at it that way that keep pecking away at that materialistic worldview.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And Mark in his book really goes through these in a very brilliant way.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
What's the name of the book?

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:26.000
It's called "The End" or maybe it's "An End," I think maybe "The End to Upside-Down Thinking" by Mark Gober, G-O-B-E-R.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
And he's been on BATGAP a few months ago, so you can find him there.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
There's a new book also by Jeffrey Kripal called "The Flip."

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.400
Oh yeah, he's been on Back App too.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:43.200
This book is fascinating. I recommend him to come back on the show. But he's also

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.400
looking at a series of people, some of them scientists, others philosophers, who underwent

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:55.480
this flip in their thinking to believing that mind may well perceive matter and has these

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.400
case histories among other things.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.480
Let me, oh go ahead Chris, you were going to say.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:06.160
The field of study that shifted my thinking in that regard, because I finished graduate

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:11.680
school, even though it was in philosophy of religion, I was a pretty atheistically inclined

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:17.640
agnostic by the time I finished graduate school. I was well versed in the rise of science and

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:24.680
in human values and enjoyed that and joined that movement

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:29.160
Fully. I tell my students, if you haven't fallen in love with science, you've missed

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:34.440
One of the great romances of history. This is just such a massive, extraordinarily

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:41.600
ground shaking pivot in human understanding. But one of the areas which shifted my thinking

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:49.560
about the idea that our brain creates consciousness, and of course, clearly, our brain does generate

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:56.720
consciousness in a sense, but it was the reincarnation research. It was Ian Stevenson's research

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:02.640
at the University of Virginia and the multiple volumes that he had published, documenting

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.520
very detailed cases of from around the world, children, very small, three, four, five years

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.040
old who had detailed memories of what appeared to be their previous life. And he was able

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:19.600
to extract, get those memories, consolidate them and verify sufficient number of those

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:26.880
memories to build an extremely strong case for the fact of reincarnation, without knowing

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:32.120
the theory of it, without knowing how it actually takes place, that there is some type of continuity

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:37.000
of consciousness. Now, there's lots and lots of levels of issues involved in these things.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.760
one life to another life.

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:43.240
Yeah, it seems to be. Some people would say, well, those memories are actually

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:47.360
drawn out of the collective unconscious, and, it doesn’t show continuity of

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:53.480
life to life. But I think Stevenson's evidence is really a strong evidence for some type

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:59.600
of continuity of an awareness from lifetime to lifetime, especially his last book, which

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:05.520
was a two-volume book on philosophy and on reincarnation in biology, in which he studied

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:14.240
187 cases of children who not only had psychological recall from their previous lifetime, but actually

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:22.440
bore the marks in their body in the form of birthmarks, which replicated wounds of death

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.880
in the previous incarnation. So somehow, it was as if consciousness had been traumatized

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.960
in such a way that it not only imprinted on subsequent mind, but it imprinted on the body

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:40.360
of subsequent mind. So, after looking at this data a lot, I think what it tells us is, we

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:47.080
have information in our mind that predates this body. And if that's the case, and if

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:53.400
those can be legitimated, verified memories, then that indicates that there is at least

00:54:53.400 --> 00:55:00.560
in some way in which our awareness, our memory, our mind is not generated by our brain.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.840
A very simple metaphor for this, which I'm sure you've both heard, is,

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:11.760
radios and televisions. They are detectors, not transmitters, they're

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:18.040
receivers of fluctuations in the electromagnetic field, which is ubiquitous. And if the radio

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:26.480
breaks, the radio transmission from the tower 50 miles away or something doesn't stop. Other

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:32.040
radios can still pick it up and we can get a new radio and listen to it again. So, if

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:39.840
consciousness is a field as opposed to just a product of the brain, then we're all tapped

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.200
into that field and we kind of share it in common as a foundation. But then how do you

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:50.280
account for individuality and an individuality moving from life to life, from one body to

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.840
another? And that leads me into a question I'd like to ask, which will get us a little

00:55:53.840 --> 00:56:03.600
bit back to psychedelics, which is that research shows that subjective experiences in meditation

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:08.360
and other spiritual practices have physiological effects, which we've been talking about, and

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:13.640
Western science is only able to measure the gross physiology. And traditionally it's understood

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:19.080
that we also have a subtle physiology. Chinese and Vedic systems offer elaborate explanations

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:25.000
of the subtle body using terms such as chi or prana or shushumna and ida and pingala,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:30.400
nadis, etc. And these traditions understand that it's necessary to condition and strengthen

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:37.040
the subtle body to sustain the enormous flows of energy that accompany spiritual awakening.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:43.600
Often spiritual aspirants spend years or decades doing this before awakening occurs. So,

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:49.000
this whole subtle body thing has implications for reincarnation because it

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.160
would be the subtle body that moves from one gross body to another when the gross body

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:59.760
wears out. The Bhagavad Gita says it's like changing clothes. But here's the question,

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.840
what are your thoughts on the fact that anyone can ingest a psychedelic substance without

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:11.000
having prepared the subtle body? Or can psychedelics facilitate such preparation? Either of you

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.320
can answer this. I'm going to give this one to Chris.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:20.280
Thanks, Michael. m: Now the question is built on an

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:24.840
understanding of subtle bodies and gross bodies that is totally unfamiliar to me.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:32.000
In answering, in responding, I don't want to assume the observation that it's the

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.240
subtle body that transfers from incarnation to incarnation. It may be, I'm just not sure

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.800
that we've nailed it down that close.  So it's a hypothesis. Let's take

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.160
it as that. It's a hypothesis. And so, again,

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:51.440
individuality is the whole question is what is individuality? So is the individuality

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:58.560
of one life transferring to the individuality intact in another life? And I think those

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:02.880
are very subtle and complicated questions and I don't mean to prejudge them at all.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:08.240
So, I don't want to assume a set answer to what is individuality or what is the subtle

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:16.600
body. That said, my experience, I have a lot of convictions around the subtle body and

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:23.720
specifically, the impact, the way psychedelic experiences can impact the subtle body. But

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:29.840
to explain,  let me just say a little bit about my background because there

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:36.640
are so many different variations of psychedelic experiences and I want to define mine. That's

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:44.280
the body of data that I draw from. When I finished graduate school in '78, I met the

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:49.000
work of Stanislav Grof immediately. He had just published Realms of the Human Unconscious.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.560
He had a hundred essays published by that time. And I was immediately taken, atheistically

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:02.760
agnostic as I was, I was immediately taken by his research proposal that through these

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:07.720
substances if they were used in a careful and controlled circumstance that we could

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:15.280
use them to experience deeper dimensions of our own mind. And I was particularly interested

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:21.840
in his observation that one can go deeper than personal consciousness, one can go deeper

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:26.520
than even collective unconscious. You can go deeper into the mind of the universe itself.

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:32.640
He didn't say it quite like that, but that was the implication of what he did. And I

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.600
was immediately fascinated by that because I was a philosopher of religion and exploring

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:42.600
the consciousness of the universe. If there is a consciousness of the universe, could

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:50.640
it have enormous implications for a variety of philosophical questions. So, this was 1978

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:57.760
and I wanted to do this psychedelic work. I was just like Michael after doing the research

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.600
and looking at the literature and looking at some of the people's lives who've been

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:08.000
changed. I wanted to participate, and I basically did what Michael did. I basically made a choice

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.640
to have some underground experiments with psychedelics. I don't like going underground.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.480
I'd much rather be in a legally sanctioned experimental protocol, but that wasn't available

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:28.040
to me. So, I chose to learn Stan Grof's methods for working with psychedelics and how to have

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.440
a psychedelic session and all the ins and outs that have now become kind of standardized

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:39.720
in psychedelic protocols to use his methods and then to use them privately to explore

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:46.560
my own consciousness and to do it as rigorously as I could using all the philosophical and

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:52.480
phenomenological and psychological tools I've gathered in graduate school. Now Stan

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.560
differentiates between two different types of psychedelic work, low dose psychedelic

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:04.800
work, usually between 15-200 micrograms and high-dose psychedelic work, which is usually

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:12.800
up to maybe 500 micrograms, 600 micrograms. These low-dose method generates a sort of

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.960
a gradual slowly peeling back the layers of consciousness through this personal unconscious

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:24.480
through the perinatal or the death-rebirth dynamics into transpersonal reality. The high-dose

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:31.600
psychedelic work was in the early years focused on working with terminally ill patients, cancer

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:38.680
patients, and they were basically trying to not heal the personal unconscious, but to

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:44.520
kind of blow through all the levels of the personal unconscious, trigger a near-death

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:51.880
type experience, a trigger a profound encounter with the universe, and then let that encounter

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:59.160
with the deeper structure of the universe see how it might impact their anxiety around

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:06.280
their imminent death. So, what I did after about four, three low-dose

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:14.680
sessions, I opted to work with a very intense regimen with LSD. I worked at psychedelic

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:21.120
therapy. I did what turned out to be a 20-year regimen of doing high-dose psychedelic therapy,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.320
always using the same protocol, always using the same test conditions. I worked at 500

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:33.520
to 600 micrograms, which is not a protocol that I recommend. I really don't. I didn't

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:43.080
know as much then as I don't now. But what I did was to do 73 high-dose, fully

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:50.920
internalized, therapeutically focused psychedelic sessions with a sitter, and my wife, first

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:56.520
wife, Carol, who is a clinical psychologist, agreed to be my sitter and was my sitter for

01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:06.200
all of my sessions. And I just pressed this. I worked for four years, and I stopped for

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:11.800
six years, and then I came back and worked for 10 very aggressive years. So over the

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:22.480
course of 20 years, I did 73 sessions. Now, I wouldn't recommend this protocol. I would

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:30.200
really recommend people work with lower doses. And there is no research protocol right now

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:37.540
federally sanctioned that is recommending or looking, considering using doses this high.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:43.520
But I wanted to push the limits, and I thought that if psychedelic, high dose psychedelic

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:49.080
work could be done safely three times in the Spring Growth Project, then it could be done

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:54.920
safely more than three times. What I found was that it could be done safely more than

01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:01.140
three times, but it's very, very demanding work, and it's more demanding than the original

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:07.960
protocols that Spring Growth envisioned. And it opens up opportunities that the early protocol

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:14.200
did not envision, but it also opened up challenges that the early protocol had not envisioned.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:20.200
And one of those challenges has to do with how these deep states of consciousness impact

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:29.580
our body and impact our subtle energy system. Because what I found was that when I went

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:36.680
into these states and went into deeper levels of consciousness and then stabilized my consciousness

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:43.640
at that level so that my conscious experience was coherent and stable at that level, eventually

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:49.520
pushing, continue to push, I would drop down later into a deeper level of consciousness

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.560
and then stabilizing at that level and then dropping into a deeper level of consciousness.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:01.080
Each state into a deeper level of consciousness was a state into a higher level of energy,

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:07.520
just extraordinarily, very, very powerful levels of energy. So that I had to work very

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:13.600
conscientiously as all long-term psychedelic journeyers do, work with the body, work with

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:20.960
the subtle energy system, work to detoxify the body, work to clarify negative emotions,

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:27.480
work to basically strengthen the subtle energy body. So basically purification, I think,

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:34.880
is essential and is endemic to working with psychedelics. In Tibetan Vajrayana, the monks

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.720
have to do ngondro before they are allowed to take in the high teachings capable of generating

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:49.680
enlightenment. So ngondro are the foundational practices. They are the five 100,000 practices

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:58.080
that every monk does in Vajrayana. One of those practices involves doing 100,000 prostrations

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:04.480
while reciting mantras and prayers and doing visualizations. That's a tremendous transformation,

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.280
clarification, strengthening of your subtle energy system. And they do this as a preliminary

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:15.600
to entering to receiving the teaching that will allow them to enter into the very, very

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:21.640
deep states of consciousness that Vajrayana makes possible. If you go into these deeper

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:27.880
states of consciousness quickly, like you tend to do in psychedelic states, tremendously

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:35.440
powerful purification processes are triggered. Physical purification processes, physical

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:41.720
detoxification, emotional detoxification, mental detoxification. There's a tremendous

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:47.160
kind of catharsis that takes place at all of those levels. And some of those levels,

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:54.360
I think, are well described in terms of our subtle energy system. So, you really have to

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.200
work with the subtle energy bodies. And I don't think of them as just one body, but

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:05.520
multiple bodies that mesh very well against the Indian Ayurvedic system or the Chinese

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:11.240
acupuncture meridian system. you're actually almost downplaying

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:17.440
what you went through here. If people were to read your book when they do, it's a tribute

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.240
to your wife that she was able to sit through these sessions as your sitter watching you

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.760
go through this because you were going into convulsions, there was projectile vomiting,

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:33.560
you were making all kinds of weird noises, and what you were experiencing subjectively

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:40.160
was excruciating in many cases. Suffering beyond anything you could have imagined.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:47.120
And you chalk it up to deep purification. You say in your book, "The core of the cycle

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.160
is this. Increased awareness triggers the surfacing of toxins in the system that in

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:57.840
turn precipitates a crisis of disease followed eventually by a higher level of health. This

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.840
cycle operates at many levels. At the physical level, the psychological level, and the soul

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:07.480
level." And very often -I'm just summarizing here -but very often in your sessions the

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.600
first part would be one of these horrible ordeals that you would go through, and then

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.280
the second part, having cleared that away, you'd go into an ecstatic realm and experience

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:26.800
all kinds of beautiful things. Yeah, basically again, I'm going to discuss

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:33.320
this strictly in terms of the LSD body of work. After I stopped my sessions, I've done

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:38.480
psilocybin a number of times. I'm comfortable in that world. I've done ayahuasca several

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.660
times. I'm comfortable in that world, but I really would like to restrict myself to

01:08:42.660 --> 01:09:01.880
just the LSD work in describing this. When you die as a self, I understand psychedelics

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:07.160
following Stan Grof, and this is a description in terms of their psychoactive properties,

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:14.880
not their physiological and neurological properties, but psychologically they seem to function

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:20.320
as amplifiers and catalysts of psychological processes. So, they take what is small and

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:28.520
make it loud, and they take what is distant and make it close. So, it's a hyper catharsis

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:35.580
and a hyper amplification. For a number of hours, we enter into a temporarily hypersensitive

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:41.840
state of awareness, and what we do with that awareness determines what happens in a session.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.040
We can listen to a concert and have a good time. We can have conversations, or we can

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:52.760
go deep within and use this hypersensitivity to unearth the obstacles to healthy functioning,

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:58.440
But then if we go deeper, we can enter into deeper levels of existential functioning and

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:04.360
deeper relations with the universe. It's important to remember, I think, that what we are doing

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:10.960
in our laboratories is we are rediscovering a class of chemicals that have been used in

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:18.600
cultures for thousands of years. Ayahuasca, we have at least 1,500 years, and psilocybin

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:26.720
mushrooms and peyote and mescaline. So, there's a lot of history between humanity and these

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.280
substances. Now what we're doing is studying them in a particular context, which is giving

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:39.200
us great insight into these processes, but there's also a large body of wisdom held in

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:46.360
these cultures that have been using these materials for a long time. According to many

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:54.480
of these systems, their view is that consciousness is a universal quality of life. We are individually

01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:00.760
conscious. Other aspects of the physical world are individually conscious, but the universe

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:11.320
is conscious and that there are many tiers of comprehensive functioning in the universe.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:19.080
And when you enter into deeper states of awareness, each of these deeper states is a higher level

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:29.380
of energy, which then requires a stabilization, it requires a purification process and stabilization

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:35.800
process to stay coherent at that level. Now here's the tricky part. When I started this

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:42.400
work, I was thinking this is all about therapy or this is about healing my personal psyche

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:50.440
or it's about enlightening Chris Bache’s poor psyche. It's about something personal. But

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:56.800
some of the pain that you're referring to, Rick, came about when I went through, after

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.960
two years of work, went through a crushing ego death experience, just cracked me wide

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:09.520
open and then it took me into a new layer of work where for the next two years I went

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:19.920
through excruciating psychological, psychophysical suffering. It was so large and so broad

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:26.000
and so deep and it went on for so many years that eventually I became convinced that this

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.600
was not about healing Chris Bache’s'B
psyche. It's not about purifying something that's

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:39.360
somehow personal to Chris Bache. That eventually I was forced to draw the conclusion that somehow

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.360
something had happened in my sessions that the universe or some functional dynamic of

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:50.800
the universe was using my sessions to bring about some type of healing at the collective

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:58.160
level of consciousness, some type of healing aimed at the personal psyche. And eventually

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.560
the way I understand this is that just as I remember all Chris Baches' experiences for

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:10.320
better or for worse, the human species, there is a mind of the human species that remembers

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:15.160
all of the experiences of all the members of its species. So then if you think about

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:19.360
all the terrible things we've done to each other and all the wars and all the killing

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.680
and all the bloodshed and all the rape and all those terrible pains that somehow the

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.680
species is stuck with those and has to digest those in the same way that I am stuck with

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:37.640
Chris Bache’s' experiences. And that just as it's good for Chris Bache if I can somehow

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:44.560
confront the darkest pieces of my shadow and bring that to rest, the same thing happens

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.200
at the collective level for the species as a whole. Usually that type of confrontation

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:58.040
takes place in terms of social transformations or social revolutions, but I think in very,

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:05.480
very deep psychedelic work my experience was that somehow something was using my sessions

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:13.000
to decathlete some body of pain and suffering that was stuck or lodged in the collective

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:21.520
psyche. So, to me I just had to go to a collective model in order to understand the data.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.440
That actually gives new meaning to the saying that Christ died for our sins,

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:35.760
you know? I mean, if a being is of great enough stature in terms of the vastness of his awareness,

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:42.400
then it's like an ocean being able to dissolve lots of mud and stuff as opposed to a glass

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.880
of water which can only take a little bit of mud without becoming entirely overwhelmed

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:47.880
by it.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:54.480
We see that also in the Buddhist traditions, the bodhisattva is basically someone who basically

01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:00.560
places the good of the whole over their individual good, makes that their project. But I don't

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:08.000
think this is heavy-duty spiritual requiring great, great beings. I think any mother, any

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.320
father worth their soul, would do what they can to help end the suffering of a child that

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:22.040
they saw. This is just part of the natural case, what it means to be a human. So, if

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:27.840
you're given an opportunity and in deep psychedelic sessions you sometimes are given an opportunity,

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.560
if you're given an opportunity to relieve suffering, it's just the most natural thing

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.640
in the world to try to do that as best you can.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:42.520
Sure, but as best you can. It's a question of capacity. Rupert Sheldrake

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:48.160
talks about morphogenetic fields and you were just alluding to fields being able to store

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:57.280
the traumas of humanity. And I've also heard it said that wars break out when there's enough

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.480
stress accumulated in the field that it can no longer be contained, like the

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.800
way lightning strikes when there's enough static electricity built up in clouds. And

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:14.280
so, if we can sort of become that field or attune ourselves with it then it seems from

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.360
what you're saying in your book that we can become an instrument for its purging, for

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.360
its purification.

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:30.160
Yeah, I think the universe seems to be intensely interested in us as individuals,

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:36.760
but the universe also seems to be intensely interested in us as a species. And when you're

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:43.600
moving into that level of consciousness where the universe is communing with the species

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.960
and you've gone through ego death, and you've gone through a series of deaths where you

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:56.200
basically, have dissolved your boundaries and have basically opened up into not all that

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:03.240
it is, not mind at large, but species mind, the collective mind of the species, it seems

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:11.000
very clear that the universe is nurturing the well-being of this universe, of this species

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.960
just as it nurtures the well-being of all individuals within the species and all the

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:24.240
other species on the planet. That there is a tremendous power that cascades through all

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.960
of our lives individually and collectively.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:31.240
Michael have we lost you?

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:37.560
No, I'm fascinated by what I'm hearing. I don't know quite how to process

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:44.280
it. I'm kind of curious to know, Chris, where did that turn come from thinking you were

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:52.080
dealing with your individual suffering to realizing that this was a collective matter,

01:17:52.080 --> 01:18:01.600
that this was a transpersonal question? Was it an insight you had during one of these

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:09.960
high dose experiences or was it in processing it after the fact? Because that's a big shift.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:16.560
Yeah, it was a big shift and it is a both-and,

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:22.600
but probably the most important part of it was after the session as I processed and worked

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:28.840
it. It took me years, because I kept trying to process in terms of Stan's paradigm, in

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:33.400
terms of the paradigms that were available and all the paradigms approaching psychedelics

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:39.640
were always about healing the individual, enlightening the individual, something like

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:46.240
that. And I kept trying to understand and I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn in large part

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.680
to answer the question, why did suffering get as large as it did in my psychedelic sessions

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:59.400
to try to answer this problem. And eventually that's where I made the jump beyond the person

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:07.000
centered model into a collective model. Now my thinking has gone further since then, but

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:13.800
that was where I made the jump. And I wrote that in '95, '96, I started the work in '79.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:21.120
I wrote that book when I was about 15 years into that process. So, it took me at least

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:32.480
10, well, after when these experiences started, it took me years before I could really say

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:38.280
that idea and then agree to that idea. And then once I began to see it and understand

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:46.440
it, then a whole lot of other things began to make sense because the collective level,

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:54.440
After going through that ocean of suffering, I call it the ocean of suffering,

01:19:54.440 --> 01:20:00.880
which lasted two years. When that came to a culmination, when that culminated and I

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:06.600
went through a death and rebirth process that was associated with that level of consciousness

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:14.640
and went deeper into archetypal reality, high archetypal and low archetypal reality, I had

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:21.680
many, many experiences that basically showed me how that worked, showed me how the species

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:29.960
mind is alive within all of our fractally embedded individual minds, how our individual

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:35.840
minds feed into the collective mind, as Rupert Sheldrake says, and how the collective mind

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:41.760
move feeds into the individual mind, that there's a constant feedback system in that

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:47.520
process. And that's intellectually, it was Rupert's work. When I integrated Rupert's

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:52.920
morphic field theory into Stan Gross' paradigm, that's the part that gave me the intellectual

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:59.280
permission to make this radical reinterpretation of the data.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.880
That's fascinating. How do you respond to people who say, "Well, you just had a drug

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:11.560
experience. You messed with the chemistry in your brain and you had these delusions

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.920
that you were getting some kind of insight into something collective." That's

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:20.280
how a lot of people not versed in this world or having had this experience would automatically

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:25.680
go. Why should a molecule afford such insight?

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:34.280
Well, that's an anthropological question. And I'd rather leave that one to the anthropologists.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:40.120
But I understand the objection. I understand the cautionary concern. I was trained

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:46.840
as an analytic philosopher and I was trained in a highly, kind of highly skeptical discipline.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:55.280
So, I really affirm that I value that skepticism. But I also, I think it's important that we

01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:02.120
look at the history of human beings' use of these substances and look at some of the literature

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:09.120
and how these substances have been regarded in other civilizations. I think it's important

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:15.760
to look at all the data that is emerging in the modern study of psychedelics. So that

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:23.120
in Dark Night, Early Dawn, I have a chapter on the methodology of basically taking a philosophical

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:28.760
approach to psychedelic inquiry. And I list some of the reasons why we should take these

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:34.880
series, these experiences seriously and we should not dismiss them. One of the data is

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:40.080
we sometimes get knowledge in these states of consciousness that we did not have prior

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.840
and we can reasonably exclude that we did not have, but this knowledge turns out to

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:50.920
be true and valid.  Like the perinatal research that Stan did,

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.720
for example. Some people, will relive aspects of their

01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:01.520
birth that they can later verify or kind of more radically, one can have an experience

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:08.960
which teaches you something about how whales give birth or how lions experience hunger,

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:14.280
which you had no idea of before, never crossed your awareness before. And it turns

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:21.280
out to be physiologically accurate. Sometimes in one case, I remember Stan saying that in

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:28.600
one of his sessions, he was confronted with a person who basically was insisting that

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:35.120
Stan call his mother and father, gave them a telephone number and wanted to reassure

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.520
the parents that he was okay. And this was really, really strange and out of left field.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:47.320
But they wrote down the number, wrote down the names and after the session was over and

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:56.000
everything was stable again, Stan very carefully reached out to this phone number and found

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.640
the husband and wife on the other side and the phone. And it turns out that their son

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:07.840
had just died. I don't remember whether it was several days ago or several weeks before.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:15.280
And they understood that their son would wish them to know that he was okay. So, you get

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:19.400
very, very unusual circumstances like that.  So wait a minute, this wasn't the

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.600
physical person in the room that gave the phone number, this was something Stan kind

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:29.200
of cognized in some psychedelic state and actually was given a phone number by some

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.040
non-physical entity and then called the parents and it panned out.

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.400
It was verified. Wow, that's interesting.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:42.280
Chris, you said also that you wouldn't recommend this kind of regime. I

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:47.800
have two questions about that. Why not? And second, after the agony that you went through

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:53.560
in these sessions, how did you ever muster the courage to do it again, let alone two

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.640
more times? Yeah, before you answer that Chris,

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:02.320
I just want to add a little related bit. Did you ever feel that maybe you were frying the

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.840
circuitry and all this suffering was a result of some damage that you were inflicting upon

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:13.860
yourself or that maybe you were opening yourself up to some negative astral level or something

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.640
like that? How did you have the confidence to proceed? I'm just adding that on to Michael's

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.920
question. Well, I really trusted Stan Groff's

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:29.440
work. that's why I consider myself in his lineage. My work is based upon his

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:36.720
scholarship. I trusted what I saw in Stan's work. I trusted the methodology. I trusted

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:42.320
his surveying of the literature. I trusted his evidence that there was no physiological,

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:49.560
no genetic damage. I trusted the cases that he presented. I appreciated the rigor with

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:55.080
which he had digested all various bodies of psychodynamic theory, as he does in Beyond

01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.840
the Brain and integrated them into the phenomenology of psychedelic discourse.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:08.840
And primarily, one of the primary things I got from Stan's work was an absolute trust

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:17.520
that if you surrender completely to what arises in your psychedelic session, you can trust

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.880
that. And you may not understand it going in, and it may be absolutely horrendous and

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.520
painful going in. It may take you months or years to understand why things are unfolding

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:34.200
the way they are. But you can trust it, and it will always come out good in the end. And

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:43.000
that was the procedure I took. I found-- why not doing this work, and then

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.920
what happened in the work? Why not doing this work? I wouldn't work at doses that high.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.680
It's not that I wouldn't recommend doing doses that high occasionally, but I

01:26:53.680 --> 01:27:02.400
wouldn't do such a pounding, blowing a consciousness apart so aggressively for so many sessions

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.880
and so many years, even though I was doing it in a very responsible manner. I was doing

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.600
it about five times a year, so I had a lot of time to recuperate. I was taking care of

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:16.880
my body. I was doing spiritual practice during all this time. I was keeping detailed notes.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:23.280
I made a phenomenologically precise record within 24 hours of every session. I studied

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.280
the sessions. I was really trying to be as methodical as I could. But basically, by the

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:35.200
time I was at the end, the time I was finishing this journey, I had a number of breakthroughs

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:43.200
and a number of insights we can talk about. But I came to understand that one other assumption

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:48.360
that I had made about this work was wrong. The assumption was that there is a certain

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.520
goal that you can get to, that there was an end point, that it could be oneness with God

01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:01.280
or oneness or the meta cosmic void or the supracosmic void, that there was an end point that you

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:11.760
would get to. And what I found eventually, when I had experienced many permutations of

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.240
oneness, I found that there are variations and subtleties of oneness and there are even

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:25.960
variations in the void, in the domain of formlessness. And if you have a method which is so powerful,

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:31.120
it keeps pushing you to the edge of your experiential boundaries. It'll keep taking you through

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:38.000
remorselessly boundary after boundary after boundary, leading into deeper, deeper intimacy

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.280
with the, I call it the creative intelligence of the universe. I don't know what else to

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:49.840
call it. It's infinitely vast, it's infinitely intelligent, it's infinitely compassionate.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:57.160
What it has taught me and just the experience of dissolving into it

01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:04.800
without any boundaries left over has been enormously, has been deeply life-changing.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:10.200
But late into the process, about 17 years into the process, I had an experience where

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:17.440
I was as far deep into the diamond luminosity, I call it, deep into what the Buddhists call

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:24.120
Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. As far into it as I had ever gone, I was in

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:32.600
deep state of bliss and clarity. And all of a sudden, my visual field pivoted 90 degrees

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:40.920
and I saw reality far, far in the distance. It looked like galaxies and a ray of light

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:47.960
emerged from that reality and hit me and it absolutely shattered me. And in those few

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:54.000
seconds I realized it's an infinite progression. You cannot get to the end of the universe,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:01.240
you cannot get to the end of the mind of the universe, it's an infinite progression. And

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:07.320
that's one of the reasons I would be gentler with myself. I would be gentler because I

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:13.560
think what we can do with these substances, we can open ourselves up to the infinity and

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:19.040
we can take in as much of the infinity as we can get into our system, as much as we

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:25.440
can psychologically digest, emotionally digest, physically digest, and I'm more patient now

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.480
with the slower trajectory of spiritual and psychological development than I was when

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:36.540
I was a young man running into the states. What you were just saying addresses

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:43.520
something that Michael brought up a few minutes ago, which was how can some molecules adjust

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:50.000
our brain in such a way that we actually begin to have cognitions, deep meaningful cognitions

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.200
about the meaning of life or the nature of reality and all that. And I had written down

01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:02.080
a question here, "Are psychedelic visions merely projections of our personal psyche,

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:07.640
or do we experience things that actually exist but are ordinarily beyond the range of our

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:11.600
perception?" But what you just said about the creative intelligence of the universe

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:16.480
or the mind of the universe answers the question, because if that's the way it is, if there

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:22.440
is a mind of the universe, if the foundation or the ground state of the universe is an

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:27.200
ocean of creative intelligence out of which the universe emerges, then by whatever

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:34.000
Means, psychedelics or meditation or whatever, that we manage to merge with that ocean,

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.360
then we sort of realize our ultimate essential identity with that mind of the universe or

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:44.160
with that creative intelligence, which is, we can say, the repository of all the laws

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:50.200
of nature, the repository of all knowledge. And although as a human being we can only

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:56.640
kind of express so much of it, we'll always have our limitations as a finite instrument,

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:08.240
we can kind of dip into it in such a way that we share in a kind of omniscience.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:14.780
You know what I'm trying to say? And we absorb it to some extent. And so, all the great pronouncements

01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:20.120
of the mystics throughout the ages have been their attempts through the human form, through

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:25.400
human language, to express that merging that they experienced.

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:34.740
Yeah, I think when we have temporary experience of infinity it leaves a lasting

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:41.000
impression even when we are back to being a finite being. And if we have temporary experience

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:48.560
of infinite love, all-embracing, all-inclusive, and a love that transcends species and reaches

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:55.520
out to the molecules of existence, the atoms of existence itself, then when we congeal

01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:03.920
back into our ordinary time-space suit, it has an effect, it has a profound effect. And

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:10.440
I guess that's one of the other reasons I would suggest that we should give these experiences

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:15.920
a measure of credence. It's not just because of the empirical assessment, empirical data,

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:22.080
and the correlation between multiple experiencers. And I want to mention there's always deception,

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:26.360
there's always incompleteness, there's always distortion. We always are going to have to

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:32.120
deal with, “well, what if it's just this and not that?”  Absolutely, that's the

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.040
nature of the dialogue, that's a discussion. That's a worthy question.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:40.280
The experience has enormous authority. I think it's one of the most striking

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:45.880
things about psychedelics is that, what William James called the noetic sense

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:51.920
in speaking of mystical experience, that it is, these don't seem just kind of subjective

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:59.920
opinions, they seem like authoritative truths. And that's one of the reasons they're so sticky.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:06.400
I wonder, Chris, whether you feel that with the proper discipline and commitment you could

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:13.880
get to the same place with meditation. Absolutely. I think so, with some

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:20.660
qualifications. In that, since I'm a professor of religious studies and I've taught courses

01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:27.680
in comparative mysticism and I have had the luxury of studying some of the mystical traditions,

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:33.280
the great masters who do this through entirely natural means, and there are masters who do

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:37.800
it with other assisted means as well, the great masters have always been my guiding

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:43.920
light in this material. And it's always been, to be able to sustain these states

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:50.160
for a few hours is great, but to be able to sustain them for months, years, that's greater

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:58.960
still and to be respected. Now, I mentioned that Carol, my sitter, is a serious Vajrayana

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:05.520
Buddhist practitioner always was during the years we were working together. And she never

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.960
did a psychedelic session, never did a session with me. She was always much more contemplative

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:17.840
in her practice. And subsequently, after we had separated, and she's remarried and I've

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:23.840
remarried, we're still close, she has gone on and completed her three-year, three-month,

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:30.680
three-day retreat under the supervision of her teacher. So, she's a serious practitioner.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:39.840
And I'm a modest practitioner by comparison, but I understand the relationship between

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:47.720
my psychedelic experiences and the experiences which are preserved in the meditative traditions

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:54.440
that she has introduced me to or that I've been introduced through her. And I see a very,

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.520
very strong correlation. I don't think the cosmology that we're encountering with deep

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:07.120
psychedelic work is original. It's not new. We see this cosmology in the great spiritual

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:17.280
mystical traditions of history. That said, I think that all of those traditions in history

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.800
are all stage specific. They all reflect a certain historical context and anthropological

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:28.120
context and even an evolutionary context. I don't see them as eternal truths. I see

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:33.920
them as approximations of an ever-growing, expanding truth. So, I think that there are

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:40.760
certain ways in which the cosmology that psychedelics can introduce us to can push the edges of

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:47.040
those classic cosmologies and you can push the edges and that opens up new possibilities.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:54.480
I don't think, for example, a deep immersion into trans-temporal experience is a deeply

01:36:54.480 --> 01:37:02.760
ingrained quality in mystical experiences, but that has happened a great deal in my psychedelic

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:10.680
experiences. I started this work in 1979 because I was

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:15.360
interested in spirituality. I was interested in enlightenment. I had been meditating for

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.080
a number of years. I thought that I could encounter the kind of blocks that are pretty

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:25.560
typical in early stages of meditation and I thought that by doing some sessions I could

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:31.640
deal with those blocks, blast through them and I could reach enlightenment faster. It

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:38.560
didn't work out quite that way. But what I found was that when I really went into it,

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.640
that was one track, the enlightenment track. A second track opened that was really a very

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:50.080
different track and that's the track of cosmic exploration to actually explore the consciousness

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:55.920
of the universe, to explore deeply the fabric of reality and experience it all its ins and

01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:04.720
outs. It's not that these are incompatible, but the cosmological inquiry came to dominate

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:12.240
my sessions. So, I wouldn't want to use the measure of enlightenment as meaningful and

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.440
beautiful and important as that is, as the criteria for evaluating everything that happened

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:23.520
in my sessions. I sort of see there are different projects and only in the very late years did

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.280
it kind of come back around into the classical enlightenment kind of work.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.760
I think there have been plenty of yogis and siddhas and so on who have done

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:40.800
plenty of cosmic exploration and they've written down their findings.  They've just

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.120
gone about it through various other means. Did you want to add something there, Michael?

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.800
No. Okay, I have a line of questioning

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:53.320
here that will shift our gears a little bit. Let me just mention one thing.

01:38:53.320 --> 01:39:01.480
If psychedelics, if LSD is only an amplifier of consciousness, then by definition it does

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:06.360
nothing that can't be achieved through other methods for exploring consciousness, because

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.320
it's not the psychedelic which does this, it's consciousness which does this. We're

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:17.640
simply amplifying and focusing it and you're focusing consciousness in meditation, you

01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:22.200
can go into these places in meditation. Yeah, and that thing you said about

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:29.480
patience as you get older and kind of abandoning the enlightenment or bust attitude, I mean,

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:33.520
I had done some psychedelics in the 60s for about a year and then I learned to meditate

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:39.760
when I was 18 and I've been doing it for 51 years, a couple of hours a day. And for

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.560
many years there was a sort of desperate feeling of, "God, I've got to get enlightened,

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:48.160
I've got to break through." After a while that just sort of dissipated, it just sort

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.320
of oozed away and contentment kind of dawned and I just don't think that way anymore. I

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:57.960
don't know whether that's due to natural maturation or whether it's due to the results

01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:05.640
of meditation bringing about a kind of an abiding sense of fulfillment, which is not

01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:12.000
dependent upon any external circumstances. But one way or the other, I think that whatever

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:19.840
one chooses to do; safety first is a good rule of thumb because impatience can result

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:26.600
in some pretty unfortunate situations, if one proceeds recklessly in any sense.

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:31.480
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so here's a question I wanted

01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:39.320
to ask. I have a good friend named Dana Sawyer, we've been friends since we were kids practically.

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:44.240
He's been a professor of religion and philosophy at the Maine College of Art and an adjunct

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.500
professor of Asian Studies at the Bangor Theological Seminary, and he's written biographies of

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:55.640
Aldous Huxley and Houston Smith. And he had two questions that are related. One is, "What

01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:00.780
are the connections..." we've kind of covered this, so maybe the answer to this first bit

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:06.660
will be quick. "What are the connections, similarities and differences between psychedelic

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:10.920
states and mystical states of consciousness?" Have we covered that adequately? Maybe we

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:14.560
have. Well, the researchers that

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:21.080
I spend a lot of time interviewing see them lining up very closely, and sometimes they

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:27.960
use the term "mystical-like experience" because I think they don't want to offend anyone on

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:37.780
the religion side. But they study very closely the anatomy of mystical experience, especially

01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:47.020
as William James described it, and they feel that it has all the 6, 7 or 8 characteristics.

01:41:47.020 --> 01:41:53.060
Yeah, actually I was reminded and a question just came in that Ram Dass gave

01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:59.740
some LSD to Neem Karoli Baba, and apparently it had no effect on him, because presumably

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:05.280
I guess the interpretation was that he was already in some kind of high abiding state

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:11.980
and LSD really couldn't add to it in any way.  I've heard that story for a very long

01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:18.940
time and the dose was one of Chris's doses, it was like 500 or 600 micrograms, and I have

01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:23.140
to say I've always thought it was apocryphal, but we have to ask.

01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:28.460
Now you'll find the story in the book "Miracle of Love" which is Ram Dass's collection

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:34.500
of anecdotes about Neem Karoli Baba, and according to Ram Dass, he gave him 600 micrograms the

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:42.780
first time, and then basically he wasn't affected. He came back to the United States and he told

01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:46.820
his friends and he said, "Oh, he must have palmed it. Nobody can take 600 mics and not

01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:52.380
be affected," and he went back to the ashram and Neem Karoli Baba called him over and he

01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:58.900
said, "Do you have any more of that Western medicine?" And he brought everything he had,

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:05.580
1200 micrograms, and Neem Karoli Baba, according to Ram Dass, put them on his tongue and made

01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:11.340
him see that he was taking them and swallowed them, and it didn't affect him.

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:17.620
Did you ever hear Bruce Joel Rubin's story? Bruce wrote the screenplay for the

01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:24.900
movie "Ghost" and he won the Oscar for that, and he also wrote the screenplay for "Jacob's

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:31.220
Ladder" and some other movies. Anyway, he's been on Bat gap, but he was a teenager living

01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:37.260
in New York City in some apartment, and somebody brought over a glass mayonnaise jar full of

01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:42.520
liquid sandos that was going to be shipped up to Millbrook for Timothy Leary's gang and

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.540
asked if he could store it in their refrigerator. So it was in their refrigerator, so they're

01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:50.220
sitting around and they think, "We should try this,” and so his friend was

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:56.940
going to put a drop on his tongue using a dropper and he squeezed the whole dropper.

01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:01.100
Anyway, you can look it up, it's quite a story.

01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:05.700
Groff says that there is a natural threshold of about 500 micrograms. If you

01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:10.380
take more than that, you don't necessarily get higher, so there's a kind of a cutoff

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:12.100
around 500 to 600 micrograms.

01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:13.300
That's good to know.

01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:14.300
Saturation point.

01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:17.300
Here's the important question, and then we should let Michael go. This is

01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:22.500
my second one from Dana. I should have asked this one first. He said that Houston Smith

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:27.660
once argued that traits matter more than states, and even if psychedelics can trigger religious

01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:32.860
experiences, it's less clear they can develop religious lives. Dana mentioned that psychedelics

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:38.540
can definitely trigger genuine mystical states, as measured by eight of the nine parameters

01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:45.620
of the states/Panki typology, but the ninth parameter is continued improvements in behavior.

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:50.980
So, is there evidence that psychedelic experiences lead to more compassionate or selfless behavior?

01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:58.500
I think it's a really good question. I don't think I know the answer to it.

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:05.740
Some people feel that the fact that attaining knowledge through psychedelics is

01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:14.620
so rapid, I hate to use the word easy, especially after what Chris has told us, that it is less

01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:25.020
enduring, has less traction in our lives. The analogy sometimes used is that

01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:30.020
if you climb the mountain and you get to the top and you get that view, and then someone

01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:35.420
lands on the mountain in a helicopter, they get the same view, but they haven't earned

01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:43.100
it in the same way, and therefore it is less powerful. That strikes me as kind of a Puritan

01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:52.740
view, that you need works, you need good works to justify faith. So, I don't know

01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:56.900
if it's true. I think that there are many people who've had psychedelic experiences

01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:00.740
that they've carried the insights and the convictions through to their lives and changed

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:06.060
their lives and become more moral or more ethical people, and there are people for whom

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:10.300
it hasn't been sticky. And I think that's part of the work of integration. I think that's

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:18.060
part  of approaching it with reverence and recognition of the power that

01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:22.860
there is another big step, which is how do you apply what you've seen and what do you

01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:27.060
do with it and how does it change your behavior? And I don't think there's anything, there's

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:33.940
nothing inherent in the experience that makes you more or less likely to do that. It's really

01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:39.180
up to us. But, I think it's something everyone doing these explorations should bear

01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:43.020
in mind. It's not going to be automatic. There are people who've done psychedelics

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:47.420
and come out and behaved really badly, and there are people who've had their ego dissolved

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:54.580
during psychedelic experience and then it inflated enormously after. And so, I think

01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.940
we have to be very wary of those pitfalls.

01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:00.500
I think the same can be said of meditation. I know people who've

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:06.300
been meditating for decades that I wouldn't want to associate with. They act

01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:11.820
like real SOBs sometimes, and others who really underwent a deep transformation and became

01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:16.660
much better people. So maybe there does need to be, in addition to whatever, the practice

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:20.900
for dipping in the consciousness, maybe there needs to be a kind of a conscious attention

01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:28.100
to ethics and, being a more responsible human being.

01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:34.860
Yeah, I completely agree with both of you. I agree with you, Michael, that a

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:41.760
mystical experience does not a mystic make, to paraphrase Houston Smith, but also a mystical

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:50.540
experience can a materialist philosophy unmake. And so, I think it has philosophical significance

01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:56.180
if we have X number of people who do X number of sessions and have an emerging consensus

01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:03.420
around what they envision the cosmos to be like. That's significant. But I think you're

01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:10.060
absolutely right. To have an experience does not necessarily make you a wiser, kinder,

01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:16.860
gentler person. But if you use those experiences and work conscientiously in integrating them,

01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:22.060
then hopefully they will. They don't flip a switch. They don't make you what you are

01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:26.620
becoming automatically, but they act as, I think, a seed catalyst.

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:29.660
Yeah. And you cultivate those seeds.

01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:34.900
Yeah. Well, I think that's a great note for me to leave you on. I'm very sorry

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:39.740
I have to leave, but I have another appointment. And I thank you very much for a very stimulating

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:42.300
conversation and I look forward to continuing sometime.

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:46.140
Yes, thank you so much, Michael. And I should add that Michael's book will be coming

01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:49.420
out in paperback on what, did you say the 14th? Tuesday.

01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.860
Well, Tuesday. By the time this interview is up, the book

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:58.900
will be out. And you can get it on Amazon and I'll have a link to it on the page on

01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:02.420
batgap.com where I feature this interview. And Chris, I look forward to your

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:06.140
new book and I'll be sure to order it. c  Thank you, Michael. We have more

01:49:06.140 --> 01:49:08.820
conversations, I hope. We have lots more to talk about.

01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:11.420
I think we do. We've just begun. Thank you.

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:12.420
Absolutely. Bye-bye.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.420
Thank you, Michael. Real pleasure.

01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.700
And those who are listening, hang on because I'm going to continue a little

01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:21.380
longer with Chris. Let me start, Chris, by asking a few questions that have come in from

01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:26.780
the audience, and I want to save time before we wrap up to talk about your notion of the

01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:32.420
birth of the future human, which I think is fascinating and the changes that humanity

01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:37.500
may have to go through as that birth takes place, okay? So, let's budget our time. Let

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:41.260
me know when you feel like we should cut the questions and get to that.

01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:46.740
Here's one from Amit in New Zealand. He asks, "After ayahuasca sessions, I experienced

01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:51.580
some detrimental energetic shifts, for lack of better words, waking up deeply physically

01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:56.820
tired for months afterwards that became somewhat worrisome. Are there specific methods or practices

01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:00.460
that you can personally recommend for the most efficient integration and minimization

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:05.900
of any potential detrimental physical energetic effects after some deep sessions?"

01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:15.980
That's a complicated question. First, because every psychedelic is a little different,

01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:21.420
and  you're talking about ayahuasca. It has a different quality than LSD and a different

01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:29.020
quality than psilocybin mushroom. But basically, ayahuasca, potentialists assume a rather strong

01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:38.540
dose of ayahuasca, has tremendous impact on our physiology and our psychology. And when

01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:45.260
we jar ourselves that way, when we enter into these temporary conditions of awareness, which

01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:50.460
are so radically different than our ordinary awareness, it's going to shake up our system

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:57.980
and it's going to impact us. And I think we have to be gentle with ourselves and we should

01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:03.980
cultivate practices of contemplation to help us integrate these experiences. I don't think

01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:11.140
there's necessarily any formula that will ensure an outcome that doesn't lead to these

01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:18.580
periods of physical exhaustion or sometimes a psychological kind of exhaustion that follows.

01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:24.220
But basically, I think if we go to the spiritual literature, and we look at the literature about

01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:30.620
what does it mean to take up a spiritual practice, my belief is the more powerful the psychedelic

01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:36.060
experience you want to cultivate, either by the nature of the chemical, the strength of

01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:40.980
the chemical, or the frequency with which you're doing the chemical, the more you push

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:47.580
your system into this new territory, the more important it is for you to cultivate meditation

01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:53.060
and the classic forms of contemplative practice, taking care of the body, stretching the body,

01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:58.660
taking care of the subtle energy system, taking care of your emotional life, taking care of

01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:03.020
your mental life, your spiritual life. I think those are all important.

01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:08.220
Now, how it actually cashes out to a specific regimen. I know I have my regimen,

01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:13.140
I always have had my regimen that changed through the years. I just think it's good

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:20.460
to ask the question that he's asking and to seek advice and to cultivate the regimens

01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:26.420
which will help stabilize the system when it's come back from such an extreme experience.

01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:32.000
Good answer. And there's other things: exercise, diet, obvious

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:39.620
stuff that anybody benefits from if they do it regularly and properly. So, all

01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:44.580
that stuff - everything is interconnected. This is a question from Bobby in Griffin,

01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:50.460
Georgia. Bobby asks, "If psychedelics give a glimpse into true nature or reality, then

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:55.200
that seems to beg the question of there being some sort of sheath or mask covering common

01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:01.300
daily experience. Is this sheath or veil developed during early childhood and therefore would

01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:08.420
infancy and early childhood experience be akin to psychedelic experience?"

01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:16.700
Well, I understand the logic and I sort of see that and I know the number of

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:22.820
people would say that. And at the same time, I hope no child has ever had some of the experiences

01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:29.900
that I've had on psychedelics, not just the negative ones, but even the cosmic ecstatic

01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:37.820
ones. That's an extremely powerful experience and I hope a child doesn't have to take that

01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:44.540
in. But within that caveat, I think there's a certain sense in which children are more

01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:50.540
naturally receptive to some of those more sensitive dimensions of consciousness and

01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:56.500
they lose that sensitivity as they get older and it's kind of talked out of them and conditioned

01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:04.700
out of them until later they have to rediscover it. I think it's not just like something that

01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:13.260
happens in childhood. Again, I don't just study psychedelics, I study reincarnation

01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:20.020
research, near-death episode research, out-of-body research. I study lots of different forms

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:27.500
of non-ordinary states of consciousness. And I think the image that's coming clear is that

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:35.100
when we die, we expand into a larger, subtle, higher state of consciousness and when we

01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:42.060
incarnate, we contract into a small, physically dominant kind of consciousness. We die, we

01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:47.900
expand into great spaciousness, we incarnate, it gets small. We keep this up over and over

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:54.220
and over again. The more we do it, the more over thousands and thousands of years, the

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:59.820
more we do it, slowly we begin to integrate spiritual dimensions and physical dimensions

01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:06.060
so that they're not really an either/or, that they begin to be a both/and within our own

01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:13.900
lifetime, within our own body. So, I think it's actually taking up an incarnation at

01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:20.620
all has a naturally contractive effect on consciousness. I don't think it's something

01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:25.420
we're doing wrong to our children, though once you understand that progression, I think

01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:29.460
there are things that we can do that would help our children adjust to this world.

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:35.660
Yeah, that cycle you just mentioned can be true of meditation too. My

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:39.300
teacher used to use the example of dyeing a cloth in India, where they'd take the white

01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:42.860
cloth, dip it in the colored dye, then bleach it in the sun, then dip it in the dye, then

01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:46.260
bleach it in the sun, go back and forth and back and forth until eventually it becomes

01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:50.860
colorfast even if you leave it in the sun. So, you dip into samadhi and then you engage

01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:55.580
in activity, and you do it again and engage in activity, and the nervous system gets transformed

01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:57.580
thereby. Yes.

01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:02.100
And the samadhi becomes stabilized, so you end up having Nirvikalpa samadhi all

01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:07.700
the time, or whatever they call the term. It doesn't have to just be with eyes closed.

01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:10.780
Yeah. : Okay, one more question from the audience

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:16.340
and then I want to get into the birth of the future human. So, David from Cambridge, England

01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:21.260
asks, "If psilocybin or similar substances were made widely available to the public,

01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:25.460
do you think there would be a negative side effect to consciousness and/or society? Are

01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:30.300
these substances restricted, perhaps due to society not being ready for them?" And I'll

01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:35.520
add that Michael Pollan wrote an op-ed in the New York Times just the other day commenting

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:43.440
on the recent permissiveness in Colorado for the use of psychedelic mushrooms, and he cautioned

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:45.220
Yeah, they decriminalized mushrooms.

01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:50.100
Right, so he cautioned, you know, take it easy, we shouldn't go too fast here

01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:55.680
because there could be negative consequences. Yeah, we should have gotten Michael

01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.980
to comment on that since that just came out today.

01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:04.560
I ran out of time, yeah. Yeah, okay, focus on the Cambridge

01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:09.980
question again. r:  Oh, is it perhaps prudent

01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:17.180
that psychedelics are restricted to the extent they are, or at least to some extent, because

01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:21.940
all hell might break loose if they just became like the libertarians want to legalize

01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:27.140
all drugs. I don't know if that would be advisable. One of the points that Michael makes

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:32.600
in his article, if I can just invoke something he said there, which I completely agree with,

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:38.320
is that when you look at cultures who have a long-term relationship with psychoactive

01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:45.940
substances, you do not find them being used recreationally. You find them being used under

01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:53.700
very careful ritual spiritual conditions. You find them being used in collective circumstances

01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:59.260
that you don't just go trip out by yourself. We have a great deal to learn from cultures

01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:04.620
who have a living history with these substances. Our culture has very little living history

01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:10.620
with these substances except recreational or in the underground movement. So we are,

01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:17.460
given our naivete, maybe it is good to be cautious for bringing these into our culture.

01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:21.600
But I absolutely agree with something else Michael says, is that nobody should be put

01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:30.700
in jail for possessing some psychoactive mushrooms. I don't think they're toxicology,

01:58:30.700 --> 01:58:35.060
they're very safe psychologically, extremely safe. They're not habit forming. You want

01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:41.400
to use them carefully. You want to use them under guidance, but they're much less destructive

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:46.700
than cigarettes or alcohol. And we've learned how to live with cigarettes and alcohol. So

01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:52.500
I hope that we will decriminalize, I hope that we will more importantly, we will

01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:58.240
learn how to work respectfully with these very powerful substances. They can be life

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:03.580
transforming but we have to be careful as we approach them.

01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:09.580
Good, so well said. You have a section in your book towards the end that's entitled

01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:14.380
"The Birth of the Future Human - Global Awakening and its Impact on Society." I just want to

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:18.800
read a couple little bits from it. You say, "I believe that the global systems crisis

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:23.940
taking place in the world outside us is deeply connected to the evolutionary metamorphosis

01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:30.140
taking place inside us. You say, "Humanity is coming into a time of great awakening,

01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:35.340
a profound shift in the fundamental condition of the human psyche. But for there to be a

01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:41.100
great awakening, there must first take place a great death. This global crisis will be

01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:47.940
so severe that it will impact not only individuals but the collective unconsciousness of humanity

01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:54.380
itself." And I'm just going to read a little bit more because when you had the session

01:59:54.380 --> 02:00:00.900
in which you kind of cognized that, you wrote recently, "It took me more than a year to

02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:05.740
recover from this session. For months I walked around the city where I live feeling like

02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:10.580
someone walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb was dropped with unbidden knowledge

02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:16.060
of what lies ahead and profound respect for all the participants. It was terrible to experience

02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:21.020
humanity's coming collapse but redemptive to experience the rebirth that followed. Since

02:00:21.020 --> 02:00:25.860
that session I have never doubted the larger arc of our evolutionary journey even as I

02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:31.780
mourn its casualties. Without a vision of where nature is taking us, without understanding

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:36.500
the higher good that our collective suffering is bringing forward in history, we might drown

02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:41.740
in the sorrow that lies ahead and we must not drown. I believe the form that the future

02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:48.660
human will take will be the diamond soul." So that gives you a springboard to elaborate

02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:53.340
a bit. Yeah, okay. Let me just back up just

02:00:53.340 --> 02:01:01.780
a second. When you work with high doses of LSD, when you're doing it in a totally internalized,

02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:07.940
contracted for and you intensify it with music and eye shades and all that usual good stuff,

02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:13.380
you basically just explode your consciousness. You just shatter your consciousness and you

02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:20.460
explode it and for six hours or eight hours at a time you become a different kind of being.

02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:31.020
You're not a human being. You open yourself up into unprecedented intimacy

02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:36.740
with the universe and the universe is in the role of teacher and in the role of instructor

02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:41.940
and the universe decides where you go and what you learn. It seems to be a balance between

02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:49.060
what you're capable of taking in and what the universe wants you to take in. So as my

02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:55.500
journey continued and I was doing this systematically over the years, one of the things that began

02:01:55.500 --> 02:02:03.620
to happen about 23 sessions in started then is that I began to have a series of visionary

02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:12.220
experiences of where the universe was taking the human race, the human species. Basically

02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:18.740
about the evolutionary dynamics of the species, one's consciousness became such a powerful

02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:24.120
factor in human evolution where we're not right now fundamentally changing our body

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:30.400
very fast but we are changing consciousness relatively fast. And so, I had many experiences

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:41.660
of the evolutionary dynamics of where humanity is and where it's going and the vision that

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:47.180
came through over and over again was that humanity was poised on the edge of an enormous

02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:52.300
breakthrough, just a tremendous breakthrough that would forever change the foundation of

02:02:52.300 --> 02:03:00.060
life on this planet and it wasn't simply a civilizational breakthrough or an economic

02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:04.380
breakthrough or technological breakthrough or an industrial production breakthrough.

02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:11.460
It was a breakthrough in the fundamental platform of consciousness, the fundamental baseline

02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:18.140
of human consciousness and that there was a tremendous pressure building up and there

02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:25.040
was a tremendous kind of acceleration of our conscious dynamics and there was a tremendous

02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:31.680
detoxification taking place in the reincarnation of generation after generation. So, this was

02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.340
not simply influencing individuals, it was influencing the entire human species, there

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:44.620
was a collective dynamic. It showed me the vision that we are coming

02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:50.380
to a great awakening, just an exponential increase in our psychological and psychophysical

02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:55.860
capacity but it didn't give me any indication of how it was going to accomplish this. I

02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:02.420
had no idea after years of vision how it was going to accomplish this. And then in 1995

02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:07.580
the universe took me deep into deep time, it was a grueling experience to get there

02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:14.140
but eventually blew me out into a radical expanded time framework and took me into the

02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:22.420
heart of the death and rebirth of humanity. The state of consciousness that I was in when

02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:28.980
I went through this process was not Chris Bache having a collective experience, I dissolved

02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:35.820
completely and I experienced a coming crisis as the species experiences it. It's

02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:41.100
like being able to experience a thunderstorm where you can experience the storm as a totality

02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:51.540
and each individual drop simultaneously. And what it showed me was that this tremendous

02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:57.260
global systems crisis that we are entering which seems to be driven by an ecological

02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:06.820
crisis, this world climate change eco-crisis leading to, would lead to a tremendous global

02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:14.860
crisis of a fundamental institutions, a major die-off around the planet, tremendous pain

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:22.740
and suffering. But that this pain was actually transformative, that this pain was actually

02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:30.380
part of a process of confronting our past and confronting the legacy of that past, essentially

02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:36.580
confronting karma and going through a death and rebirth process that would basically carry

02:05:36.580 --> 02:05:41.860
us beyond our standard level of functioning before this point in time. So, there was a

02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:50.020
sense in which in this event, it's not a single event, it's an evolutionary process. I don't

02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:54.020
know how many generations it will take. I'm assuming it would take multiple generations

02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:59.580
for this to be enacted, but that we actually will be brought to our knees, we will lose

02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:05.820
control, we will basically suffer terribly, our children and grandchildren will suffer

02:06:05.820 --> 02:06:13.580
terribly, but that this suffering was actually labor. It wasn't simply a destructive process,

02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:18.500
it wasn't simply an extinction process, or it may feel like that at the time, but it

02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:26.300
was a labor process that when this process reached its absolute peak, and it looked like

02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:35.020
we would all die, the storm passed and there were survivors. And as the survivors began

02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:42.420
to pull their life together, they began to connect with each other in new and unprecedented

02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:49.740
ways. There was a time of new values, new insights, new technology, new social relationships,

02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:58.260
a new internalization of deep spiritual values, fundamentally a new experience of oneness

02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:04.900
in our daily lives that we really truly experience that we are all one in this process and we

02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:10.820
have deep responsibilities to all life forms, not only to each other in human life forms,

02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:20.860
but to all life forms on the planet and elsewhere. No that's sort of one kind of, that's the

02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:27.740
part that you quoted. There's another part of the sessions which basically took reincarnation,

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:32.540
- I wrote my first book on reincarnation, I've spent a lot of time thinking in terms

02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:41.260
of reincarnation, but it took me deep and it took me into an experience where

02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:45.780
I began to integrate all my former lives. They began to come in to be very fast and

02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:53.460
furious and they began to, it was like winding light, kite string made of light around a

02:07:53.460 --> 02:07:59.220
spool and when I had integrated so many lives, eventually there was a fusion of all of their

02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:05.820
learning and all of their experience fused into one and when there was a fusion, my consciousness

02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:14.700
exploded into a diamond light consciousness and I became an individual,

02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:21.100
but in an order of individuality which I had never experienced before. It was the sum total

02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:28.420
of all of my lives that had cascaded and lifted me into a state of consciousness that was

02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:37.620
more than just the sum of all their experiences. There was a catalyst into a deeper functioning

02:08:37.620 --> 02:08:42.660
of conscious awareness with respect to myself, with respect to other people and with respect

02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:47.500
to the universe. That's what I came to call the birth of the diamond soul, that when we

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:52.820
reincarnate over and over and over and over again, we are not simply making incremental

02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:58.820
improvements on our quality of life, more compassion, more knowledge, so on and so forth,

02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:06.260
but in an evolutionary sense, there comes a time when sooner or later the soul wakes

02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:12.980
up inside our physical incarnation. So, all of our former lives, all of our learning,

02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:19.220
all of the experiences we have kind of fuse and reach a crescendo and we wake up. It's

02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:24.820
like the bubble pops and we wake up and we know we are not just this body, we know we

02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:30.860
are not just this ego, we know we are not just this incarnation, that we have relationships

02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:35.140
with everyone around us that's been going on for thousands of years and it opens up

02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:40.980
new possibilities for a deeper communion with the creative intelligence of the universe

02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:49.620
itself. I think what my visionary experience has been, is that this is a transition which

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:56.140
we are making as a species. We are growing into the birth of the diamond soul. We are

02:09:56.140 --> 02:10:02.980
also obviously going into a cascading series of crises at the global level. So, as we are

02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:08.820
trying to become one planet in the outside, I think there is a synergistic coupling to

02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:14.420
the fact that we are trying to become one being internally. We are integrating all of

02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:22.940
our former lives into ourselves as we are trying to transcend the limitations of our past engineering

02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:28.500
and ecological industrial practices. We are trying to become one planet geophysically,

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:34.940
geopolitically. We are trying to take responsibility for the healthy functioning of a planet that

02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:40.780
reinforces and is fueled by this intra-psychic process where we are trying to grow up. We

02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:46.540
are trying to come to terms with who and what we actually are. This is what I call the birth

02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:52.100
of the future human. I think this crisis that we are entering and that will dominate the

02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:58.060
21st century will continue probably on to the 22nd. This crisis is not simply an economic

02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:03.660
crisis, it's not simply an industrial production crisis. It's a crisis of consciousness. It's

02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:11.220
an evolutionary crisis and it's giving birth to a future human. Late in my sessions at

02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:18.340
the very, very end, the last great vision that the universe gave me in one of my sessions,

02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:24.940
it took me deep into deep time. It took me deep into the future and it gave me my last

02:11:24.940 --> 02:11:30.820
experience of the future human. It was as if it took me into the future and allowed

02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:39.460
me to try on for size the fundamental blueprint of the human psyche at that point in the future.

02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:48.300
This was the most extraordinary being. Just, I can't describe to you quickly what an extraordinary

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:55.540
Being, this being is. Just picture the highest, finest qualities we've imagined. Picture the

02:11:55.540 --> 02:12:01.780
highest spiritual capacities we can imagine, a mind completely open to the universe, a

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:08.980
heart completely open to each other, just an extraordinarily magnificent being. That's

02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:14.140
what's at stake here. That's what we're trying to become. That's where I think we're going.

02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:21.620
Beautiful, so eloquently put. I can't really add anything to it and we're almost

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:26.000
out of time, and I'll just say that if anybody finds what you just said frightening in terms

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:33.700
of what the world may go through in transition to this beautiful future, there

02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:37.700
are people who are stocking up food and stocking up guns and doing all kinds of

02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:43.380
things in preparation for the chaos they feel will be coming, I'd say that what you really

02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:48.500
want to stock up on is consciousness, spiritual evolution, as much of it as

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:54.380
you can get under your belt through whatever means works for you. That will be the best

02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:57.820
form of preparation for whatever life may bring.

02:12:57.820 --> 02:13:04.620
I absolutely agree. The old kind of survivalist is basically trying to take care

02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:11.700
and hold on to ego, but what we really need is cultivation of service, transformation,

02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:17.980
generosity, compassion ? those are the qualities that will carry us into this future.

02:13:17.980 --> 02:13:22.780
Yep. Alright, well I've really enjoyed this conversation, I've really enjoyed reading

02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:28.700
your book. I want to close with an endorsement from our friend Anne Baring, who's been on

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:34.300
BATGAP, about your book. She said, "Once or twice in a century a book appears that has

02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:39.020
the explosive force of a supernova, breaking through the limitations of religion, science

02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:44.180
and culture. LSD and the Mind of the Universe is such a book, a gripping account of an utterly

02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:48.900
unique and extraordinary hero's journey that opens our minds and hearts to a new vision

02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:54.460
of our universe and ourselves as inseparable from the ineffable being we have called God.

02:13:54.460 --> 02:14:00.180
All beliefs fade before the incandescent revelations contained in this book, a deeply moving template

02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:06.100
of our evolutionary journey." I think, beautifully written, and it was a marvelous book. So,

02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:09.860
the book, as you said, won't be out until when, November or something like that?

02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:14.820
November 26th. Amazon has it on pre-order, but it'll be out then.

02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:20.460
Yeah, and I have a link for it prepared so people can order it now and it'll come

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:26.020
in time for Christmas. There you go. I did this work for

02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:31.660
20 years and then I waited to publish this book for another 20 years. It took a long

02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:38.500
time to digest everything that happened in those first 20 years before I was really ready

02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:46.820
to share them with other people. Yeah, and it's been a great conversation.

02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:51.380
Conversations like this could go on for many more hours, but interviews are meant to be

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:55.980
sort of a sampling. Wonderful, Rick, and the work you're

02:14:55.980 --> 02:15:01.420
doing here, the number of minds that you're opening, the number of conversations you're

02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:05.740
having, bringing people together ? talk about a catalyst for positive change in our

02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:09.500
future. Way to go, brother. Thank you very much. Hope to meet

02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:13.580
you in person one of these days. Yes, let's do that.

02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:18.460
Okay, so let me just close by thanking those who have been listening or watching.

02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:23.580
I encourage you to go to batgap.com and explore the menus. There's a few things there you

02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:31.300
might want to do, like sign up for the email newsletter or subscribe to the audio podcast

02:15:31.300 --> 02:15:35.720
or donate if you feel like donating. And there's some other things on the site if you poke

02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:39.500
around. So really appreciate your time and attention,

02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:45.660
those in the audience, and also you of course, Chris and Michael, who has left. But it was

02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:52.660
a great conversation and I'm really glad we got to do it. Thank you.

02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:53.060
Thank you.

you for the invitation yes my pleasure i've been uh reading i've read three out of four of your books in the last and last month or so and just been devouring them so it's it's been a real treat to read them and i've been very excited to have this conversation so um so just to begin honor yeah so just to begin i'd love to hear you share your background and really your life story anything that you'd like to share about yourself biographically and your story basically i made my living as a university professor at a modest university in northeast ohio i'm a professor of religious studies my background is i have a degree in notre dame in theology from notre dame and new testament criticism in cambridge and a phd in philosophy of religion from brown and so i'm very classically educated raised in the deep south coming from mississippi but when i finished my graduate training and came to youngstown state university where i taught for 33 years i met the work of stanislav groff of course one of the foremost authorities in the psychedelic integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy and his work was a turning point in my life so at that point i continued to do my work and i've just made my living week in week out year in year out in the classroom doing the things that professors do but in my personal life in my private life i began a 20-year journey working with high doses of lsd in a therapeutic protocol pioneered by stan and other early researchers exploring the deep structure not only of my own consciousness but of the consciousness of the universe itself at least that's my understanding of my best interpretation of where i went so after holding that material and sitting on it for 20 years i i did this work for 20 years between 1979 and 1999 and i sat on it and crunched it and digested it for another 20 years before releasing lsd in the my end of the universe the story of that journey so basically i'm a university professor who's part of the underground psychedelic movement in this country [Music] beautiful it's it's been an incredible journey to learn about and i appreciate you sharing it um i you know you allude to a few in a few points to kind of who you were before you started this journey and your younger self and i i forget exactly how you put it but but sort of like uh you know you might not have expected me to go down this journey and i was sort of i got the picture of you as sort of like straight laced and sort of like uh analytical what were you like at that time before you started all this well i began my life uh seeking to be a catholic priest i was in the seminary in high school from three years of high school and got a degree in theology from notre dame so i began very conventional and at the same time by the time i finished graduate school because of all my education that i had acquired i became an atheistically inclined agnostic basically the study of philosophy of religion and science had basically wiped my theological slate clean and i became a pretty hard and fast agnostic and that's the way i began this work and it was the lsd work that opened me up to a broader understanding of existence now i've been a meditator all my life since college and i've practiced within different buddhist traditions within the the passina tradition and zen tradition and eventually settling into the vajrayana tradition but that all came after um the psychedelic work well i started meditating beforehand but the evolution to more specific buddhist lineages came after the psychedelic work had begun [Music] and i've raised you know three kids been married you know mortgages standard kind of affair you know and you know me look at me i mean i look like an accountant you know i kind of i was designed to be an undercover agent for alex wow i love that description what what was it that so captured you about groff's work when you encountered it oh well i immediately saw that if what he was saying was correct this had enormous implications for philosophy which was my interest not just for healing and clinical psychology but here was the method that allowed us to get deep firsthand access to dimensions of consciousness and through those dimensions of consciousness dimensions of reality that i had seen described in many spiritual literature bodies of literature but here was a protocol that allow people to be initiated if only on a temporary basis because this is a path what i call the path of temporary immersion and we have to be really careful not to confuse a path of temporary immersion from what i would call the ba the path of abiding presence more contemplative meditational path but it gave us temporary access to states of consciousness far beyond our ordinary egoic awareness and far beyond space-time awareness to explore the deep structure of the universe itself this has been a philosopher's dream in a way and particularly in our culture which was is material students metaphysical convictions which has come to believe that there is nothing in the universe outside what can be explained by its material substrate that matter is the only thing that's real matter is the only thing that exists and here was a method that was challenging that assumption gave us experiences that would be might be very difficult to explain in terms of that materialist hypothesis so that's that immediately um picked up my philosopher's ears i'm not quite sure how to ask this question but when you decided to go on this journey and you know were inspired by graf and wanted to adapt his protocol for your own use what did what did that look like practically for you what what how did you embark on that well i i followed a very strict protocol and it's one of the things i think that made my work a little unusual over the years it came when you work in a therapeutic protocol you are totally isolated from the world you don't take psychedelics and go for a walk in the woods or go to a grateful dead concert or even stay up talking with friends you're totally isolated from the world you're protected by a sitter who manages all the logistics of your day handling the music you're listening to carefully curated music with headphones and eye shades you basically like in a meditation retreat you turn your attention totally within and psychedelics are an amplifier they amplify the condition of your unconscious and it causes subtle levels of of your mind which you might or you have to really reach to be able to have access to them it allows those subtle dimensions of your mind to come forward and if you meet them in a very conscientious focused manner then a cleaning process begins a healing process a confrontational and therapeutic engagement process begins but you're totally isolated so basically it's a it's an entire weekend agenda if i'm working on saturday which i usually do i'd start in the early morning would last all day until after supper time you're spending days beforehand that there's protocols that you do beforehand a lot of preparation of your body a lot of preparation of of your diet and of your spiritual practice there's certain spiritual practices i would do before a session and spiritual track practices i would do after a session eventually uh so it's one very intense day followed by several days before and after preparation and you know it's a several day commitment each session i did i chose after several medium dose sessions i chose to work at very high levels using psychedelic therapy not low-dose psycholytic therapy this is a protocol that i don't recommend today it's not that i'm against occasional high doses of lsd but this consistent working just exploding consciousness so violently or so aggressively it's a protocol that i really don't encourage today but i worked at 500 to 600 micrograms for 73 sessions in 20 years and on average that came out to about five sessions a year i worked for four years i took six year hiatus and then i worked in a very aggressive 10 years so it worked out to about five sessions a year can you explain the difference between psychedelic and psycholytic protocols yeah a psycholytic protocol is a low-dose protocol where which stimulates the unconscious more gently and allows it sort of peels the unconscious layer by layer and so layers of your trauma or anything you're holding which is problematic or uncomfortable for you surfaces in smaller increments layer by layer if you work with high doses of lsd in the early years these were limited to three sessions the the work it's that stan did at spring grove hospital in baltimore was working with terminally ill cancer patients who were dealing with death anxiety and what they were trying to do was to precipitate a something approximating a near-death experience to give these people who were dying a bit of a glimpse of foretaste of where they were going when they died so it's a very powerful a much more evocative state instead of processing all the individual layers of the personal psyche it tends to blow through those and drive consciousness into a more radical state of awareness so what i did was i thought well if you could do this work safely three times you could do it safely more than three times and i was still thinking in the early years in a personal model i was thinking of cleaning my own consciousness but cleaning it in bigger and bigger exercises it's kind of like eating my karma in fewer and larger bytes and it turns out that model was completely incorrect uh as i learned by the second or third year um did did you have a sense when you're starting out that this would be a long-term endeavor that you'd be doing these journeys many many times no i didn't uh when i started it out i had been meditating and i had encountered the usual blocks that everybody hits in the early years of meditation and i first thought i would do some this therapy in order to push through and clear those blocks in order to accelerate my personal awakening um and it turns out that that was a false model to bring to it and but once the adventure started once i began to break into these experiences of the cosmos then i was hooked i i did not expect it to be taking up such a large proportion of my life and what i found was if you go very deeply into this work you're you don't integrate it around the edges of your life and continue to live your life kind of like an ordinary life deep spiritual practice as you know all when you commit to very deep spiritual practice it becomes your life you wrap your life around your spiritual practice and that happened for me too i mean it just this became uh a central focus of my life of course i my students and my teaching were central focus my children and family and marriage were central focus but my psychedelic work became the core of my deeper philosophical undertaking and how did those aspects of your life relate to each other and influence each other well basically uh i i feel that my marriage and my teaching uh were very grounding first i i loved being a parent i loved being a dad and i loved being married i loved teaching i just loved being in the classroom and i found that those commitments just kept me grounded when i was off exploring different dimensions of reality on the weekend when i would come back you know there were dishes to wash and students to teach it was a very grounding way so they complemented each other well it just you know because i mean any deep explorer i think has this experience you're going in and out you're going back and forth into these periods of deep absorption like a retreat and that's really why i mean i never say that i've tripped i say i do a session and it's kind of like a zen sachin a period set aside for intense spiritual practice a psychedelic session is really a psychedelic sheen it's a period set aside for intense spiritual practice when you go back and forth over and over again in and out of these states back into your ordinary life it's really it's important to keep them in balance and my life was organized in such a way that it did keep those two different sides of my life did stay in balance with each other and help each other and can you speak to the you make a distinction between using psychedelics for therapy and for spirituality and for you know the kinds of cosmological explorations that you ended up leaning towards can you speak to that distinction yeah and that's something i became more articulate about as the journey went on and particularly as i came back and began to write up the entire thing because i found that many people who were beginning to read my work were trying to understand it within a frameworks that were too small to understand the project and so i differentiate very clearly now three different projects that you can do with psychedelics you can do others of course but just three one is therapeutic healing this is the primary work of the psychedelic renaissance today working on healing the wounds of the personal unconscious post-traumatic stress death anxiety depression alcohol addiction this is working at a personal level at the early stages uh different than that is spiritual awakening this is basically to try to awaken spiritually to the truth of one's inner being to experientially have access to the center of consciousness which turns out to be the same unified reality as the entire field of consciousness that underlies all existence this is a different project than simply therapeutic healing it's it this is spiritual healing spiritual awakening you know opening up to the the rich spiritual underlying fabric of existence the exploring of the universe cosmological exploration is a different project still cosmological exploration is not simply becoming aware or becoming tuned to the spiritual truths of life it's exploring beyond those realities into the deep structure of existence going beyond space beyond time going into deep time uh going into deep space uh going into archetypal reality you do not have to go into these dimensions to wake up or become a fully realized human being you do not have to go into archetypal reality you do not have to go to the beginning of the universe before the big bang and watch creation emerge out of the great void of primal existence this is a very kind of different agenda and i i think it's important to keep apples and oranges separate from each other now they reinforce each other they support each other in my journey which became primarily one of cosmological exploration of course there was a great deal of healing that took place at a personal level and there were episodes of rich spiritual awakening but if i were aimed at just spiritual awakening or just psychological healing i would have organized the sessions quite differently but spiritual you know cosmological exploration is really kind of like um any kind of demanding extreme sport kind of like going climbing mount everest or going to the north pole i don't know why anybody would want to go to the north pole but it's a very demanding thing that some people like to do exploring the deep structure of the con of the cosmos is something like that it's a very demanding rigorous it requires tremendous safeguards and it is going in places that very few people have gone and it's not the same as spiritual awakening yeah on the one hand i find the distinction persuasive because this really does characterize your work and the kinds of discoveries that you found and then i think if you were holding that distinction as like a purely separate thing that wouldn't be aligned with my own experiences of these things but um it sounds like you're saying no they can all happen but it's more like what you're aiming for or what your intentions are yeah and they overlap yeah in that case how did you structure your sessions so as to aim in the direction of cosmological exploration and how might someone structure them if they were aimed at the other goals well i didn't first i didn't understand a lot of this at the time when i was doing this work i understood it only after i'd gone a long way down this road and was looking back and beginning to understand some of the choices the how the choices i'd made it impact the trajectory of the work but basically once you decide you're dosed that's a significant decision in this process but working with high doses you completely surrender to the process it's impossible to try to direct you can set all the good intentions you want but the states of consciousness that arise with high doses of psychedelics amplified by very carefully selected music and internalization in a in a kiva practice this sets in motion processes that are so powerful you can't control them at all you can't direct them and you the strategy is simply to surrender to let to let your consciousness take you wherever it wants to take you to show you whatever wants to show you no matter how inscrutable at the time no matter how painful no matter how absurd it may seem at the time just let it take you it's only after the fact when you're putting it all together that you may begin to understand some of the dynamics of the unfolding so there's a you put it together after each individual session but then over a string of sessions i found that there was a sequential development so more or less one session where one session ended the next session would begin kind of like keeping a dream journal you're just going deeper and deeper and you may not understand what's happening until multiple sessions down the road and then when you look back you understand that there's a continuity of development that is taking place across these different sessions so it's not a matter of aiming the intention beyond the dose and setting it's really a matter of complete surrender and then figuring out after the fact what has happened what is the word kiva that you used kiva you know in uh in the native american southwestern tradition when they would do sacred ceremonies with peyote or with sacraments there's a kiva as a hole in the ground you know with a ladder coming down and you sit deep in this hole in the ground around the fire ladder is pulled up you stay in there isolated all night long doing ceremony until the next morning when it's over and the ladder is brought down so it's i use it as a metaphor of what a good psychedelic session is like you're totally isolated from the world you don't get up and move around you don't talk a lot you don't engage with the outside world you're totally isolated that way you know that whatever you're confronting is coming from within yourself or coming through yourself it's not you're not being triggered by outside stimuli thank you for explaining it um yeah there's a question on my mind about uh your work and it in particular you know it's almost as if you're presenting cosmological findings and i i find them very persuasive personally and uh you know consistent with my own explorations and at the same time i there's a kind of question of um like why would someone take these findings seriously as as some kind of you know not just like a an adventure that you had or an inner experience but as something that really says something about the nature of reality yeah yeah good question and of course the critical question how do we know this is more than just why isn't it just some kind of echoes of my personal unconscious or echoes off the collective unconscious and not something that really goes beyond those canyon walls and here we have to get down there a couple of things first are are the experiences replicable do these experiences show up in the psychedelic sessions of other people if it were just me saying these things or describing these levels of reality uh then that if it's just a one-off then it may be just as you say it could be you know just a personal kind of indulgence but these the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic states first of all it's echoed in the work of other psychedelists if they you if they're using a method and a substance that has sufficient power to break through the same number of layers basically there is a convergence of experience that emerges at these very deep levels so that when i'm describing my experiences other psychedelic journeyers recognize them they recognize them as reflecting their own experiences well what's important in this context is to put all of our experiences on the table together not just one person but everybody's experiences and by comparing all of our experiences in the context of the methodology that each of us use to realize these experiences then we get a better understanding of of what is idiosyncratic and what is common ground in that context my work i think is largely comfortable within the common ground that groff has outlined as he has integrated hundreds thousands of psychedelic sessions from hundreds of people through time but also what emerges in a psychedelic cosmology is not unique to psychedelics themselves but it is the same cosmology that emerges in deep mystical traditions in deep spiritual traditions the contemplative traditions there are nuances of interpretation of course and there are as different mystical traditions have different interpretive canvases to articulate their experiences but if you do a phenomenological analysis if you look at the lineages of witnessing that come out of world mystical cultures and you compare them to what emerges in psychedelic cosmologies they fundamentally are the same cosmology so that in that sense there's nothing unique in what i'm saying the only thing that's unique is this particular method of gaining access to these dimensions of reality yeah i think the method is certainly unique and and there at least for me some of the findings that you share feel novel or things that i hadn't encountered previously i mean in particular the emphasis on um reincarnation as a kind of process akin to evolution and uh development in a certain way i mean there are similar things that i'd heard elsewhere but but connecting it to evolution in particular feels feels novel and then um you know other things as well but then that felt new um so you said earlier that um you know about two or three years into this process that you started to have a new understanding of the work that you're doing and it was less about your own personal you know blocks and unblocking yourself what was that uh discovery and what what did you learn as that transitioned well for the first two and a half years i was plunged into a level of consciousness uh that's at the very bottom of the personal psyche it's a dimension that stan calls the perinatal level of consciousness it's at the interface of the limits of physical consciousness and the beginning of spiritual consciousness so that typically people relive their own birth they relive their their fear of death birth and death are the revolving door of life you know we get here by being born we leave time and space by dying um in order for consciousness to expand beyond time-space reality one has to confront all that conditioning in our psyche which tells us that we are a time-spaced self that i am my egoic physical body mind awareness and none of us from that perspective are really sure what happens to us when we die and many of us believe there's nothing that happens to us when we die death is a cessation of all existence and we have all sorts of fears surrounding death and anxiety surrounding death and basically in the confrontation with these perinatal dynamics one engages all those fears that the universe is ultimately meaningless that the universe completely destroys all of our uh attempts to do something of value do something of enduring that something in our life we will endure and one often re-experiences one birth in the same time but eventually if you keep at it this process culminates in a in a particular kind of existential crisis often called ego death and your your physical identity is shattered it's just absolutely shattered and then you transition into a deeper level of spiritual reality that lies beyond the parameters of your physical consciousness now this is very common in mystical traditions mystical traditions talk about the death of self shunyatta emptiness of self anata no self it's very common in spiritual traditions as well as psychedelic traditions it's what happened next that really kind of shifted my perspective i was expecting after going through ego death that i would then have unfettered access into a spiritual reality but what happened was the entire purification process began again at a different at a deeper level i began to get drawn into exercises of vast uh collective suffering uh tremendous pain and suffering physical ordeals it was like being swallowed by dante's inferno and this went on session after session for two years deeper and deeper into these vast landscapes of horrific pain and brutality and suffering far beyond anything i mean my life has never touched anything like that it's never known anything like that and it this was a real puzzle for me because for a long time i thought maybe this represented a deeper ego death but in time i eventually came to the conclusion that no this was not about healing or cleansing my personal psyche that somehow in my sessions a shift had taken place and the focus had become the healing of the entire human species that somehow i was tapping into um festering fields of pain which were being held within the collective unconscious of our entire species that just as we individually hold on to our memories and experiences and some of them are problematic the entire human species holds on to the experiences of all of its children all of humanity and some of those experiences are very very traumatic the war the experiences of war the experiences of drought the experiences of violence against each other these aggregate within the collective psyche and they burden the collective psyche just as our individual trauma burdens our personal psyche and that somehow at this point in my sessions i had been kind of given the opportunity and volunteered to cooperate with this process where the by making these vast tracts of pain conscious there was some way in which these were being lifted out of the collective psyche just as when you encounter personal trauma in your personal psyche and you confront it it's lifts that trauma out of your personal system and it was after going through this for two years that eventually there was a crescendo of this process a huge healing process which then threw me into a yet still deeper level of consciousness and that's when i began to really understand that there are cycles of death and rebirth in this work and that the cycles deepen and change as the level of consciousness that you are working on deepens so the first level of healing and cleansing was taking place at the perinatal or personal level of consciousness the second level of healing was taking place at the collective level of consciousness and then there were levels of consciousness that i went to that were even deeper but this cycle of death and rebirth purification and transformation is a cycle that repeats itself multiple times if you keep going deeper into the great expanse what words would you use to describe the levels that you went to beyond personal and collective uh when i was looking back over the whole of my journey i basically divided it into five broad overlapping categories working at the level of personal mind working at the level of the collective mind then moving into archetypal reality beyond beyond even the collective psyche and then the level of causal reality or the one mind where the entire universe moves as one and then beyond that entering for the last five years of my work what i came to call the diamond luminosity an exceptionally clear hyper hyper clear expression of pure light which when i looked for religious correlations or spiritual traditions correlations in buddhism i think this is what they call dharmakaya the clear light of absolute reality out of which existence springs so those five levels personal mind collective mind archetypal mind the one mind and diamond luminosity i'd like to return to that um maybe one of the themes in your work is i think giving a really persuasive case for reincarnation and you know i was already i already sort of believed in reincarnation for my own explorations but it's a really really solid case that you make for it i think and you wrote a book life cycles about it and then later on in your most recent book lsd in the mind of the universe you're like oh i there were some things that i i think i didn't quite get to in that book and i wonder if you could describe your your current understanding of reincarnation well as a philosopher i think reincarnation is a fundamental and important concept to examine because philosophical traditions diverge if you believe that there is no reincarnation and if you believe there is reincarnation it you end up with two different understandings of reality so one of the early things i did in my academic career was really look seriously at the question is there empirical evidence what's the state of empirical evidence for reincarnation now 50 years ago this evidence what did not exist but today it does i think we have ample empirical evidence that reincarnation is a simple fact of life and the primary work here comes from ian stevenson's work studying young children around the world who have spontaneous detailed memories of their previous lifetime and the opportunity we have verified these memories and we have separated out and really re eliminated the possibility that they could have acquired these memories through natural means so for that and for evidence from past life therapy that is a strong philosophical case can be made for reincarnation being a simple fact of life it doesn't mean we understand how it takes place we don't understand the physics of it we may even have a very incomplete understanding of the project of it what the purpose of it is and i personally think that the classic eastern interpretation of reincarnation i've come to see is incomplete it's a first approximation but it's not the complete story but because of this available evidence the first book i wrote wasn't on reincarnation which presented the evidence and then asked okay so what what so what if reincarnation is the fact of life what does this tell us about the way the universe works the classic story and the story that i used in telling that story the classic story of reincarnation is a story of the individual soul or individual consciousness making choices inheriting the consequences of those choices which out of which they then make new choices so there is a learning cycle between choosing and inheriting choosing inheriting and this takes place within a lifetime and it takes place across multiple lifetimes but it's the story of the individual soul into becoming individually more spiritually mature more capable more compassionate more talented so on and so forth in their it's an individual story what i found in my psychedelic work when i began to open up into the collective psyche and deep within the collective fields of consciousness is that in addition to this individual story there was a collective story that the entire human species and some fundamental ways operates as a single organism there is an intelligence that's operating within the entire species and that all of our individual incarnations were profoundly and subtly integrated into the integration of this group species of this group and that there was a way in which the intelligence of the species was manifesting itself in certain patterns of detoxification purification breakthrough that were happening collectively so it wasn't just individual choices driving it all but there were also collective choices and a collective intelligence driving the entire process i also was given a came into a series of experiences that gave me a different understanding of where reincarnation is taking humanity because the classic eastern vision is that reincarnation evolves you to a certain point until you have a a core breakthrough the hindus called it moksha escape where we escape ego but we also escape samsara we escape physical existence so the basic vision here is you achieve moksha or you achieve nirvana and then when you die you achieve parry nirvana final nirvana but the goal is to achieve some type of spiritual fruition which then allows you to graduate from space time and to rest in some spiritual paradise off planet whether it's the the muslim garden or the christian heaven or the buddha pure land it's some off-planet paradise but that of course leaves unanswered what is the purpose of time and space which was okay as long as we were thinking that time and space had only been around for a few thousand years but now that we understand that we're talking billions and billions of years of evolution of time and space it doesn't seem to really be a very satisfying account to say that after all these millions of years billions of years and millions of years of evolution of homo sapiens it's all the work that has gone into learning how to walk upright and and use and become a tool user and about 5 000 years ago we became conscious of this deep common ground of the psyche that as soon as we begin to become conscious of this underlying encompassing buddha nature our essential nature as soon as we become aware then we leave and the goal is just to leave and what happened in my sessions was something quite different at a pivotal session and i'd done past life therapy before i mean not in the psychedelic work but you know hypnotherapy i was familiar with a dozen or so had worked with healing and integrating a dozen or so of my former lives but in this session my former life started coming into me they were coming in to me and it was like wrapping filaments of white light around a kite spool more and more consciousness more and more lives were coming into me they had been healed they were coming into and they reached a point where they fused all of these individual lives fused into one life and when they fused i was there was an explosion of diamond light from my chest and i was catapulted into a state of awareness that was beyond anything i had known up to that point in time i was an individual but i was an individual beyond any frame of reference that i had previously known and this i came to understand as the birth of the diamond soul i language it other people give it different words but it's basically the idea here is that reincarnation doesn't just grow us individually layer by layer class by class you know challenged by challenge but there comes a time when our entire history is aggregated and integrates into a single consciousness and at that point that single consciousness becomes one's working identity so basically what's happening is the soul is becoming born inside history and by soul i'd i think there are ways of understanding the soul that are completely compatible with the buddhist teaching and no self because this is not an egoic soul it's not a soul of boundaries it's not a soul of of that's inherently self-centered in its appetites but once the soul emerges there's a tremendous breath of intellect breath of compassion and a deep communion with the spiritual forces of the universe and so the goal of reincarnation is not simply to evolve us to the point where we become spiritually awake and leave but the goal is to evolve those to the point where truly we become a the next iteration of human evolution we become a species of incarnate souls so that we're never tempted to take our private ego as our true identity but we know ourselves to be of this time traveler we know ourselves to be deeper than that and we know we have kinship relations with so many thousands of people and we have kinship relationship with the earth we know that the earth that we leave will be the earth will inherit in our next incarnation souls live on earth differently than eagles do and i think that's the i think that's the pivot we're in the process of making now and i understand four or five thousand years ago in the axial age when we first began to make discoveries of this spiritual reality the spiritual reality which is so much more satisfying than time-space reality it would develop an up and out cosmology the theology which says the purpose is to go home we don't believe belong here this is our fallen condition we don't want to stay here we want to go back to where we came from i understand that but i think it's an incomplete understanding of the deeper project of creation the project of creation is to awake and bring heaven to earth to live the buddha world here inside our physical existence what what do you feel you know so in my own life i've been really moved by buddhism and inspired by buddhism and certainly other traditions as well and i find what you're saying compelling that uh you know there there was an incomplete truth to the teachings offered in the axial age where there's there's wisdom to them and and benefit and yet it's also incomplete and um i wonder how you would describe um the relationship of the perspectives that you hold now in to the teachings that we may have received from the past and perhaps buddhism in particular well once again i want to emphasize that the work i did is a path of temporary immersion temporary immersion does not easily or conventionally lead to permanent shifts in awareness you have to do a lot of spiritual practice before any of the things that we experience in the temporary condition the psychedelic amplified condition can become our ordinary daily consciousness and so the great masters of the spiritual traditions and the great masters of the buddhist tradition have always been my heroes and their teachings have always been my guiding light in terms of how to engage these psychedelic states in a responsible manner how to invest in them in a way which leads can be converted into or leads to long-term transformations of one's baseline consciousness on this earth so first truly genuinely all honor to the great beings of these traditions and at the same time uh we know that there is patriarchy for example uh in the buddhist traditions and buddhism has had to clear itself of its patriarchy just as other religious traditions have i think there are other limitations there is a a kind of anti-physical a disparagement of the physical body and which is a subtle disparagement of nature which itself is becoming aware of and it is having to transcend i think there are elements within buddhism that have a deep appreciation of the joy of living the buddha nature and sees that the buddha nature is intended to be lived within time and space that samsara truly is nirvana when understood completely nirvana does not require an abandonment of samsara but actually is coherent with samsara and yet they're the mainstream sources of buddhism for the popular people still have kind of an up and out cosmology working christianity too you achieve salvation and then you escape to go to heaven so i think as an historian it's simply a matter of you know understanding the historical context within which these great masters were working and which helped them and hindered them in some ways from the you know the full expression giving full expression of their spiritual realization and yet in even if you're working spiritually within an incomplete cosmology the levels of spiritual realization which can be achieved is just extraordinary what great masters can do the great mahasitas of the lineages can do is just extraordinary and deserving of all respect so in criticizing the cosmology within which some of them operate that's not to criticize the level of spiritual realization they have achieved you know nor i want to emphasize again to have had unusually deep spiritual experiences in a psychedelic state is not to have stabilized those experiences any meaningful way in one's ordinary consciousness there is still a great deal of work to do before those states of awareness can become abiding in any serious sense so i always want to qualify the insights that emerge in psychedelic work yes yes and certainly for myself this is a question that comes from a place of deep respect i mean that buddhism is is like like my home in a certain way so uh but i appreciate the the clarifications that you add to it and uh um i wonder you know you spoke earlier about your own spiritual practice and the different traditions that you've been exposed to and it seems like you found sort of a home in in vajrayana buddhism is that is that right it is and it's a kind of a modified uh adriana because i was doing kind of intense vajrayana practice for a number of years and i've modified it from my own psychedelic experiences because i've come to understand that i have it's not that i've realized the states that i encountered in my deep psychedelic work but i have an understanding and experience of those levels of reality they live inside me as memories they are active memories and so i've developed forms of adriana practice i've expanded them by actively integrating those memories into the realization protocols so for example you know in in classic vajrayana practice we distinguish between the samaya sappha and the jananasatva the samayasatha is the being of construct it's the being we formulate through our mantras through our visualizations and using of tonkas and exercises to create some approximation of pure goodness pure insight which then attracts the genocide for the reality the cosmic reality so we we make our visualization pure in order to open a channel between the cosmetic reality which then we invite to poorest blessings into us well in a way i use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my samaya safa to me the living memory of the diamond luminosity is a more effective spiritual vehicle of practice than the beautiful tonkas that attempt to give some type of physical expression of this sublime perfection okay so i modify it in that way i also have a sense because i've died so many times and because i've gone where i will go when i die physically i've gone into that domain so many times i feel a deep comfortableness with it and i feel a familiarity with that domain and um i think this changes one's practice because you know we're told over and over again we practice in order to prepare for the moment of death because the moment of death is the great potential has great potential for accelerating our evolution and i agree with that and i i tried to live that in my psychedelic practice has been done in a way to prepare me for the moment of death and the net result of it is that i feel very comfortable with death and i feel very comfortable with being able to navigate what comes after death because i feel like i've already encountered it in many ways [Music] what do you think it was about adriana buddhism that attracted you and felt like you could metaphorically find a find a home there well it was my first wife carol who was my sitter in my sessions a clinical psychologist herself who really brought me into vadriana i was kind of aesthetics i was more interested in this zen tradition uh i really wasn't interested with all the bells and candles and incense and you know all the fanfare that comes with fadriana but she went there and i basically followed her there and through her met the teachers that were gathering and came through tarmandala a buddhist retreat center uh lamasville tramaliones established the center in colorado and began to study with her and go into retreats with the teachers of that lineage and so i i met their lineage of awakened beings and they made a deep impression on me if my karma had been such as to introduce me to the great awakened beings of the zen lineage then you know i could have gone there just as easily but it was just the opportunity to meet these beings to receive teachings from them that made a large impression on me and uh coming back to your explorations uh use the phrase deep time can you say what you mean by that when i uh first began to enter the ocean of suffering when i made the transition outside of egoic after ego death and i went into these episodes of collective anguish when i came every session is divided into thought of two halves there's a purification half followed by an ecstatic half so you go through the purification half and if you submit to it it comes to a crescendo a breakthrough and then you're spun into a transpersonal of section of teachings and ecstatic in teachings and next and so on so forth so when i was being when i was thrown after this very intense collective purification i began to enter into states of consciousness that were extremely novel and unprecedented for me and i came i first called it whole time and i came to call it deep time i began to have experiences of my entire life start to finish as a completed toll it was like every time moment in my life was in a tree was a tree and i experienced the whole of my life as a single tree i experienced my old age my middle age i experienced the themes of my life as simultaneously present this was such a dramatic expansion of my cognitive frame of reference that after the session i couldn't hold on to it it disappeared i forgot it i couldn't hold it but i found that with repetition going back into that state again and again and it was i was always taken into the same reality for a year for seven sessions by returning to it and working very diligently to stabilize your state of consciousness there i learned how to hold on to it i learned to remember it i learned how to become cognitively competent in deep time and what i've came to believe was that there there are really many multiple modalities of time operating within the universe later after this period when i went still deeper in my work going in toward archetypal reality i experienced larger swaths of time than just my personal life the first was my personal life about maybe 100 years but then i began to experience whole time or deep time in terms of 100 000 year increments and maybe even larger later and basically not only was my sense of time expanding but who the being was who was having those experiences was expanding so it's not simply like you take a disembodied ego and have an experience of transpersonal reality which you then bring back but literally your ego is shattered and you dissolve into a deeper level of consciousness and it is that deeper level of consciousness that opens up into these deeper levels of time and then instill deeper you you literally become a different being than simply a discarnate egoic presence you become a different being for hours and hours at a time so you're dissolved into the fabric of existence and dissolved into the fabric of existence you sometimes have experiences of how existence itself experiences time now there are some trends in physics today that are hypothesizing that just as super string theory hypothesizes multiple dimensions of existence beyond time and space that some of these dimensions of existence that physics is conceptualizing involve different modalities of time i don't know what the relationship is exactly between that and what my experiences is but my experiences that as you go to the edges of space time you enter into different modalities of time and different sets of insights emerge in these different modalities of time now i understand how absurd this sounds to my academic colleagues and my scientific colleagues who generally tend to think that the entire universe works within linear time there is an arrow of time tachyons may move backwards into time but basically the universe moves forward in time and it's an absolute limit uh i think the very best of the edge of quantum thinking goes beyond that and certainly my psychological my psycho-spiritual experiences go beyond that time became very poorest in my work estimate all my boundaries in the work i imagine it's difficult to put into words but is there anything more that you can say about what the experience of that is like like either with your own personal life seeing the whole of it at once or the larger scales well first once you acclimate to it it's not confusing at all it's clear very very clear it's it's simply a different way of relating to time uh insights emerge out of the fabric out of an extended fabric of time for example at the personal level when i experienced my my life as a completed whole naturally i understood the deep structure of my life better than i had before i understood some of the themes of my life i understood how things that i had been concerned with and the recurring issues of my philosophical inquiry and my personal life that those issues were deeply etched in life and would be consuming me for the entirety of my life i could i could see and feel my future you don't i didn't see all the details it's not like seeing all the details of your life but it is as though all your time moments congeal to give you a deep reading of what the substance of your life is about likewise when you dissolve into the human species and you dissolve into a large swath of time on the order of hundreds of thousands of years you have there are insights that arise in that context about the developmental stages of human evolution so i began to have experiences of not just of my personal future but of humanity's future and i know again i know this sounds arrogant and like ego running amok but it's the most natural thing in the world that when you dissolve into the condition of the full species mind and you dissolve into deep time simultaneously it's just natural that some of the developmental future what is from our present the future of this species comes into view but when you experience that you don't experience it as something yet to be you experience it as something that already has been and both of those are held simultaneously it is yet to be and it's also something that has been so it has a certainty about it and i don't know how to to work out or reconcile all of these things with free will and any number of different questions but there's just a there's a breadth of understanding that opens so that not only did i begin to understand better what my personal life was about but i began to understand the time and history that humanity has entered that it's coming into a developmental crisis it's coming into an evolutionary pivot point and and some of the characteristics of that crisis and the characteristics of a breakthrough which i think is coming these all emerge are these all become possible uh by shedding the limitations of linear time as we conventionally know it and going into deeper dimension of time uh i was definitely thinking about free will just now and i it makes sense that it would be difficult to address that on a large scale philosophically i mean it's a long long debate but i wonder what sensibilities these experiences gave you about your own life and free will and choices and you know sort of having a sense of your whole life did did you [Music] feel sort of like you're fated to make certain choices or that you had uh free will in it or how did that impact you personally yeah free will is a tricky topic isn't it and much of our popular discussion of it i find just not very satisfying to skims the surface um advocates of free will over tend to understate the level of conditioning that qualifies our freedom and people who believe that the determinism of our conditioning is so profound that we may feel like we're free but if you examine it really carefully you find out that your conditions are so highly conditioned your choices are so highly conditioned that there really isn't free will there i find a lot of that discussion just not very satisfying on either front to me one of the themes that has come through repeatedly in my work is that we do we do have free will it's a conditioned free will but we have within those conditions the opportunity to make choices if we didn't have the opportunity to make choices we wouldn't be truly learning there really wouldn't be an adventure of learning if when we incarnate we were simply just inheriting a predetermined fate then we're just basically going through the process of mechanical actualization and it wouldn't be a genuine learning exercise if you can't make mistakes if you can't truly come to crosswords roads and say well i'm going to go either a or or b which one should i do and that's a true choice a genuine choice which has learning ramifications then we wouldn't be it wouldn't be an adventure in learning and i don't think i think the universe wants us to learn it at least the messages that i get is that freedom is an absolutely important quality now it's always relative at early stages there's very little freedom when grass grows it doesn't have a lot of freedom in terms of how to respond to photosynthesis and so on and so forth but the more our consciousness develops the more choice enters into the picture the more individuated consciousness becomes the more the cycle of learning becomes more important and still our choice is conditioned but the conditioning gets lighter and lighter the sense of freedom being able to make clear choices emerges but to make free choices to make clear choices require certain uh self-conscious practice of stepping out of the conditioning of our mind and of course the meditation traditions are well aware of this because when we quiet the mind what we become very aware of is all the multiple voices that are going on inside us and all the layers of conditioning that are conditioning our moment-to-moment awareness and we have to patiently strip those away we have to let them exhaust themselves and as we do that clarity of unconditioned consciousness begins to dawn within our awareness right and that becomes uh that is such a novel experience and so distinct from conditioned consciousness that it becomes the very highly desirable state to cultivate to enter our true nature our unconditioned nature i think these insights replicate themselves in psychedelic work as well that what one encounters that in psychedelic work is conditioning you're throwing off layer and layer and layer and layer of conditioning purifying purifying it's like all one long nindro all one long practice of purification to uncover what is already there but something which has been covered over by that conditioning now in cosmological exploration you are going beyond what is simply uncovering what is already there but that still remains part of the one of the core dynamics is letting go of the conditioning to have a deeper experience of the clarity that's present in the immediate conditions of one's awakened mind okay can you say more about the sort of uh visions that you had for humanity's future and the time that we're in this was one of the great surprises for me in there because i never expected anything like this to emerge in my work i thought this was about personal transformation or even personal enlightenment or something like that i never imagined that the evolution of the species would become such a dominant theme in my work what happened was going all the way back to about halfway through the work back into the early early 90s starting in 1991 i began to have a series of visions they were just dropped into my sessions a series of visions that humanity was coming to a turning point this was a true before and after point in history this was we were entering a time of intense purification that we were basically purifying the human psyche of the sins of our fathers so to speak purifying ourselves lifting the conditioning of the past in order to make us more receptive to and capable of internalizing spiritual infusion spiritual insights and power that was coming into us becoming made available to us at this time in history so there was a tremendous sense of rebirth coming and all of this was contextualized within an initial experience of experiencing creation in terms of love that that the act of creation the big bang is not simply a generative acts of power or an act of intelligence but it actually is an act of love that creation is itself an act of love of cosmic love and therefore that all the suffering which is which takes place has taken place since the big bang all the suffering in in the human story in particular all that suffering takes place in the context of love this is not something which is being done to us it's not something which we are guilty we are in any way guilty about this is all part of a creative process that we entered into voluntarily we entered into by choice and it is hard it's very difficult but it is a noble gift that we are giving to the creative process to participate in the evolution of this species at such an early and barbaric time in its life that we do these terrible things to each other but all of this was coming to a crescendo a moment in history where we would pivot into a higher order a higher order of spiritual awareness a higher order of psycho-spiritual realization so this went on for years and eventually i cataloged these in the book in a section that i call the visions of awakening six core visions and that the creative intelligence was trying not just to awaken individuals but it was trying to awaken the entire species but it gave me no insight into how it was going to pull this off i had no idea how it could possibly achieve this type of breakthrough in human evolution and then in 1995 uh right before christmas in 1995 i had a session in which i was taken deep into deep time i was dissolved into the species so there was no more crispy i just dissolved completely into the species and taken into deep time and experienced the death and rebirth of humanity in a transtemporal context so i experienced a time in history of increasing destabilization of tomb of chaos and tumultuous unraveling the systems of life were being unraveled there seemed to be wave after wave of ecological crises that eventually triggered a global systems crisis a period of breakdown of structures at deeper and deeper levels an unraveling of life we were losing control uh of life we were it wasn't we couldn't kind of fix our way out of this this was a profound shattering of life as we had known it at the core and in the midst of this at the point where it looked like we were all going to die it was as if a storm passed over the island like a hurricane passing over a pacific island and the winds began to subside the metaphorical winds began to subside and the worst of the christ is past and we began to pick ourselves up off our knees and as we picked ourselves up off our knees and began to rebuild and reconnect and put together life on the other side of this crisis we were we found that we were different beings we were not the same as we had been when we went into this crisis there is something that happens in this multi-generational crisis and i don't have beyond what i've said i don't have any details of when where how it wasn't that kind of experience it was the fact that humanity was coming into a profound crisis at a global level a global systems crisis that something about this transformation would break through the deep layers of conditioning of the human heart would tear away all the self-centered behaviors not only of individuals but of our culture would just break us down and when we moved through this crisis we discovered values inside our being we discovered new values new insights new ways of being in the world new ways of being with each other this wasn't simply the birth of a of an ecologically responsible civilization it wasn't simply a cultural rebirth but it literally represented a shift in the core structure of the human psyche this was a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche that anyway that was the vision of it and and i think that the if in my experience this i examine what the nature of this future human is what is this future human that's so much more than the present human is what is it and i think it is the emergence of the diamond soul in history i think that we have been growing the diamond soul gestating the diamond soul for incarnation after incarnation for tens of thousands of years hundreds of thousands of years but the birth of the diamond soul in history is a relatively short traumatic convulsive period gestation is long birth is short i think we are entering a time in history where we can no longer afford the luxury of a planet run by egos even well-intentioned egos we have to grow up we have to grow into a deeper our deeper spiritual identity and that deeper spiritual identity is the diamond soul or the soul or however you want to languish this we need to grow up and i think that we have entered this crisis this beginning the very very early stages of an unraveling of life as we have known it and we are going into a future and i think it's really important to have a vision that's why at the end of the book i really focus on the visions that i was given of the future human because if we don't have an understanding of what's going on if we don't have a vision of what nature is in the process of producing then the pain will be so intense we could succumb to despair and some terrible apocalyptic interpretation that would be very counter our survival and i think we need to have a deep understanding of where nature is taking us how does this phrase that use diamond soul relate to the diamond luminosity that you began to experience in your own sessions is it the same thing or something different i think it's a variation of the same thing the diamond luminosity i experienced i believe to be a level of reality in the cosmos i mean in build this terminology i would describe it as a extra some historic reality which means it's beyond cyclic existence which means it's beyond the bardo there are many many many layers of the bordeaux there's the low animal hell realms there's the high daily realms but the diamond luminosity is beyond all of those and there is a clear sensation a phenomenological difference between experiencing the high deity realms and then moving into the diamond luminosity realms which is beyond all deities beyond archetypes beyond any of this dimension now when the soul congealed in my being and the diamond luminosity the soul exploded from my chest it had that same quality of light as the diamond luminosity but a slightly lower intensity of that light now let me back up we experience light many times in the psychedelic journey it's very common when you go through ego death you enter light you encounter when you enter collective dimensions you experience dimensions of light i had known light many times the diamond luminosity is not simply using a fancy metaphor to describe this light i learned that there are many degrees of light there are many dimensions of light and the diamond luminosity is an exceptionally pure exceptionally clear dimension of light i think the diamond soul as an ex as a light to being is a manifestation of this quality of light inside individuated existence so it's on the one hand it's the same and on the other hand it's a variation on the same i wouldn't want to say it's necessarily identical but it seems to be very very close i will say that when i entered the diamond luminosity work over five years basically i only entered what i call the diamond luminosity four times and i entered it about once a year for four years so i would do a very intense purification for session after session i would tap into the diamond luminosity then i would be brought back for another year very very intense purification before being brought back into the diamond luminosity again so it wasn't like accessing it easily and ever once gained accents i only touched that reality four times in its total purity from the way you're describing i'm getting a sense of almost like uh you know the scientific name for humanity currently is like homo sapiens and almost like a different kind of humanity like i don't know the latin term for diamond but like diamond human or something like that is is that consistent with what you're saying it is people give it different names some people call it homonoeticus and knowing humanity homo spiritualis some people call it homoluminense a light humanity i think many of us have this intuition that humanity is going into a next iteration you know there was a time about a hundred thousand years ago where the size of our brain basically increased fifty percent i mean in a very short period of time suddenly we were dealing with the much larger brain nature triggered it decided to give us a bigger brain that we came in with larger equipment something like that is happening now we are cooperating with an evolutionary process but we are we are not driving the process nature is driving this process nature is bringing us into this new condition and we have many people have this intuition many indigenous cultures have this intuition of this time of global crisis followed by breakthrough and there's no absolute certainty you know that we will survive birth dear birth is the dangerous time not all fetuses survive the birth process so it's not like this is a foregone conclusion but so many beings have had this intuition and they they bring different names for describing this future human [Music] there's a term that you borrow from graf of uh coax systems and then you describe uh meta coex systems and um i think a lot of what you're talking about seems related to that i wonder if you could verbally describe what those are and and explain those a little bit what stan found is that the the psyche organizes its experiences it organizes its memories in terms of clusters thematically integrated clusters so that it if it takes all of our experiences of abandonment and all of those experiences that we've had around abandonment form one tight experiential cluster which he calls a coex system or a system of condensed experience carl jung called it a complex we could have experiences around anger experiences around fear experiences around unrequited love that they basically it's kind of like reading a novel taking all the emotions that take place in the novel highlighting with different colors cutting up the novel and taking all the green and one ball and all the yellow and another ball and all the red in another ball that when we encounter a problem in the psyche we don't simply encounter one form of that problem we encounter a cluster of experiences that date back sometimes all the way into our birth experience and sometimes including former lives but we when we melt this problem we melt it in layers we first we melt the outside layers the less problematic until we eventually get to the very very core what was the seed problem which may date from this lifetime may date from birth may date from a former lifetime and we dissolve this cluster this coex system now my experience has been that the same is true for the collective psyche that the mind of the universe the mind of our species stores its history in these massive thematic clusters so all the trauma associated with war all the trauma of drought and and dying in the planes all the trauma of male female violence all these patterns of violence and and pain and suffering fear of death that these don't exist as free-floating private existences private memories within the bardo of our individual souls but this the collective psyche aggregates its history into these massive collective structures that i call metacoat systems so you have correct systems within the personal psyche and metacog systems within the collective psyche i think when i was moved into the ocean of suffering what was happening was my system was engaging metacog systems within the collective psyche and making some small contribution to removing those clusters from the collective psyche you know not all of them certainly not any of one all the way down this is a work of generations and all spiritual traditions uh the saints and sages and the contemplatives have the same experience they all tap into levels of suffering which are not personal which go deeper and that's why bodhichitta manifesting the will to save all sentient beings is the only appropriate motivation for doing spiritual practice because you quickly realize that this is a game that's not a personal game it's not a private game we're in this together it's a it's a collective evolutionary process so for me that engages media coax systems what is the species aiming at as you understand it oh i think we are we're i don't know that we can really identify aiming at but we are constantly growing we are if anything we are aiming at growing uh because if we think that if we identify what we're growing to what we're really doing is only identifying the next stage of our evolutionary growing but if we just look around it's taken us 13.7 billion years to get to here and assuming we survive this crisis we're going to be at it for millions and millions of years more so whatever this crisis is that humanity is coming into and growing beyond to grow beyond ego to grow beyond the narrow confines of our self-centered self-clinging to go into a larger um sense of our being and presence in the universe and communion with the universe this is just the next phase and we will have more thresholds and more challenges that will take us into yet another phase so if i step back from all of that and i say what is happening here what is the project i think the project is to grow and become more than we were before it's a process description it's not a it's not a content description it's a process description just to grow and become more than we were to be more capable now i think another aspect of this just on the short term all the spiritual teachings teach us that the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality atman is brahman we are made of the stuff of the divine if we speak of it in divine languages or our buddha nature our awakened nature is the same as the buddha nature of all living things of all things so um when one awakens to one's essential nature your awakening to the love and the compassion and the power that created the universe that manifests the universe and that there are many stages to this process but first there is the joy of awakening to that but then there is the process of learning how to actualize that so that one's life becomes a conscious manifestation of the power of our essential nature manifesting in the physical world and i don't i really don't want to reduce this to such simplistic philosophies like you become like what you love and and as you think is what becomes your destiny but something basically that recognizes that the experience what the experiences that come at us in the outer world are in some core way of reflection of what is coming out of us at a deep cycle spiritual level and that once you understand that there's this feedback process between what we're putting out and what is coming back to us and you take responsibility for that process then you begin to consciously manifest your chosen destiny rather than inherit a destiny which has been created by your unconscious process so that we are becoming at this stage i think conscious creators of our own destiny we wake up and we become we're basically learning how to become creators because our nature is the creative principle our nature is the same as the nature which manifested the entire physical universe so what we're learning how to do is first discover and then actualize and then participate consciously in creation inside time and space what we do with that where we take that as a species you know let's imagine what we can do a species operating out of that kind of consciousness yeah i'm getting the sense you know coming back to the question i asked earlier about like what is maybe incomplete about buddhism or other earlier teachings and you know there the sensibility that i at least received was like uh you know existence is a cycle of birth and death that is uh in some ways sort of like hellish and you should just escape and that's the goal is to escape and get out and from what i'm hearing from you it's almost as if both on individual and collective levels the aim isn't to escape but to learn and grow and evolve and uh have incomplete increased complexity and and nuance and understanding of oneself and the universe and really to to manifest that um rather than just like getting out or eradicating this or something like that yes i think so and in the end once we make this transition we understand that what we have escaped is not time and space but we've escaped a certain mental consciousness associated a constricted consciousness that is associated with our living inside time and space but when that bubble pops when we have truly escaped that small world we experience time and space completely differently we experience time and space as the buddha world that's the buddha nature if you don't mind me asking what is your everyday consciousness like now after all of these experiences and uh explorations yeah well i wish i could tell you that i'm a fully enlightened being and i just cruise in the cosmic plains all the time but that's not the case integrating in my integrating these experiences is a lifelong undertaking in fact and the more i'm thinking about it in the 20 years after i stopped this work um the more i appreciate just how large the integration process is even to the point that i really i don't really think we know how entering these deep levels of reality is is influencing us as human beings i i think we're just scratching the surface if we're working in therapeutic work and if we're bringing out issues from the personal unconscious then we have a model for how to integrate those experiences if we go deeper and have spiritual experiences of the intelligence that runs through all of life we have spiritual models for how we might integrate those experiences but when we go really really deep when we go beyond space and time when we enter deep dissolve into the luminous body of creation how are those experiences being integrated in us then in the end i don't think you can integrate the infinite into the finite the only thing you can do is integrate your finite existence into infinity and that brings us back to the nuts and bolts of spiritual practice you must remove from your being everything which keeps a smaller than the reality that you are seeking to enter into and that's a that's a lifelong undertaking uh i used to think that maybe by the end of my lifetime maybe i would have succeeded inaugurating all of these experiences now i think that that's too optimistic i think this work changed not only my present lifetime but it changed the trajectory of my entire soul's evolution i also want to say that i've kind of come to the conclusion that i pushed myself harder and farther on this work than was really probably wise for me i think that it is possible to go too deep in one lifetime and and it's not that the the suffering is problematic it's not that the pain that's inherent and purifying it there's very very deep levels it's problematic it's the joy it's the ecstasy uh it's being dissolved the ecstasy of being dissolved into unspeakable beauty and intelligence which can make your physical existence kind of feel dried up like not worth living and i think i have suffered from that after stopping my work i've really had to make conscious choices and lifestyle choices how to manage the memories that now live within me in a way that i don't think it's necessarily it's not something i don't recommend to people it's a very demanding process and i don't think i needed to do it this way if i were starting it over again i would be gentler i would have gentler ambitions and a gentler take more care of this precious body mind what would that look like practically to be gentler i think it would mean uh fewer high dose sessions it would mean if you're working with psychedelics uh it would mean integrating um working with the substance like lsd which tends to push the high cosmological ceiling with substances like psilocybin or ayahuasca which tend to be more body grounded kind of staying closer to the emotional textured body of course it always means integrating your psychedelic work with daily spiritual practice the more i've moved in this direction the more i've come to understand that the daily spiritual practice is absolutely essential in order to handle the enormous swings of energy and insight that open to you in your psychedelic work but i would just be i would be gentler i mean one of the reasons i pushed as hard as i did is because i had adopted what i learned to be as a false model i had adopted a vision that said the purpose of this work was to reach a particular state you know to reach the condition of awakened state or to reach to reach home to go home to reach heaven to reach to dissolve into the into the body of god to dissolve into the metacosmic void and what i found was that there are many degrees of oneness and there are many degrees even of the void and no matter how deep i went i discovered that there were dimensions beyond even those dimensions and the key came for me in the 50th session when i was in the diamond luminosity i was as deep in the diamond luminosity as i would ever go and right in the middle of that existence my field opened up and i saw a reality far far into the distance that was filled with the light that was even a greater form of light than the diamond luminosity and a beam of flight came and hit me and absolutely shattered my mind and that's when i realized it's an infinite progression you never the idea of getting to the end of it is just a false idea it underestimates the breadth of what we're dealing with so once i i understood that it's not about getting to a particular condition or a particular state that made me more patience or makes me more patience with you open up you bring as much of that reality into your life as you can and then you you crunch it you sit on it you you integrate it into your daily life and so i'd be gentler and have more modest expectations i'm more patient with our human psycho spiritual evolution than i was when i was a young man what would you recommend to someone embarking on a similar journey if they were inspired by your work don't do it please honestly i mean don't do it the way i did it i'm not and you know i get lots of letters from people who have said i've never done psychedelics but i know what you're speaking about i've been doing a meditation for empty of years and i've had these kinds of experiences and so we know that psychedelics are not unique to these experiences at all but my recommendation is to go slow always work within a therapeutic modality pay a lot of attention to your set and setting not only on the day of your sessions but when you do this work everyone around you is impacted your family members your friends i found that my students were being drawn into my psychedelic practice and that i wrote the living classroom basically to describe quite to my surprise how what i had thought of as a purely private spiritual practice was actually registering and impacting the lives of my students who are taking my courses in this time and that this is a natural natural event that consciousness is like water in the lake you throw in a rock and the ripples naturally spread out that this is true spiritual practice as well but it's just natural that people would be touched by those experiences so i would be gentler again i don't know why somebody would want to go to the north pole but it's not a recreational undertaking it's a serious lifelong commitment and i think it's much wiser simply to explore closer to home in ways that keeps the journey more focused on the nuts and bolts of one's daily life so i have more respect for using psychedelics as therapy and as spiritual awakening and it's a relatively rare individual who has the circumstances and the constitution to go this as deep as i did into it and i wanna there are dangers right if you open up under less than ideal circumstances if you open up in circumstances in which you are mixing it up with other people or at dance raves you can open up prematurely you and you can fail your you can have failure to close you can hurt yourself you can really hurt yourself in ways that does long-term damage and may take you years to recover so i i want to emphasize that this is not an end run around traditional spirituality it's not a and it's not an easy path it's a tricky path and it is a potentially dangerous path and you have to be very cautious when you are working with mind amplifiers i imagine the kind of person drawn to doing the work that you did wouldn't take your advice to not do it uh they might take your advice to be gentler but i imagine they'd be sort of bullish about it and be like i'm gonna do it anyway uh well you know one of the things i hope is that by seeing what i learned by seeing the description of the universe that i was able to bring back and share with other people i hope that that would answer or satisfy a certain existential longing to know these things so that they don't have to go there you know that they that they can be more comfortable living within a more textured or more inwardly closer to earth textured form of spiritual practice that they don't you don't you know when people went to the moon it satisfied so many of us who have had that longing but who will never make the trip just to see their pictures and see what it was like and i think that something can be like that with spiritual practice too yeah that's a good metaphor for it i think that certainly describes my own experience reading your book and uh i'm grateful for sort of the oh i don't remember what they call it but the picture of the earth that they took from the moon it's it's as if you took that kind of a picture for us and it's a really beautiful one um earthrise i think maybe it's called earthrise yeah i'm curious what what do you make of you know at this time there's sort of a larger uh contemporary renaissance you might say in psychedelics what do you make of that movement and what's happening there more broadly uh that's i think it's very exciting i think it's about time i'm very glad that we're going back in the direction of integrating psychedelics into our culture right now the psychedelic renaissance is focused on therapeutic healing it's by demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of these amplifying substances that we are opening the door to these substances in our culture by demonstrating that they help us deal with post-traumatic stress depression or alcohol addiction or death anxiety by healing us of the wounds of life we are demonstrating that these substances have therapeutic value and therapeutic efficacy and we're also taking pictures of how the brains behave on psychedelics and we're doing this very carefully control studies where we have control groups versus a testing group and so on so forth this is all really important i think it's it's a very important stage but i do see it as only a stage what we're going to find is the same thing we found in the early decades of the psychedelic movement that these this amplification of this of the psyche which allows us to heal the wounds of the personal psyche that same amplification when continued gets us gives us access to deeper and deeper dimensions of consciousness now there is a resistance to these deeper dimensions right now because of our metaphysical commitment to materialism right our course you know pre-quantum commitment is to believe that only things which are physical are real and therefore when someone is having an experience of something which goes beyond physical reality we call the substances that open up these experiences hallucinogens because the hallucination is something which is not real all right it feels real but it's not real but i think what better understood these substances are mind amplifiers they are psychedelics mind openers and this once we consolidate and provide sufficient evidence for the healing potential of these substances we will then begin to harness the deeper manifesting potential of these substances or their philosophical potential i think psychedelics represent an enormous philosophical revolution because they allow those of us who are kind of have modest capacities to have temporary access to whose states of awareness and states of reality that lie far beyond space-time awareness that has profound uh metaphysical implications profound philosophical implications we we can have access i mean a mystical experience does not a mystic make and that's basically paraphrasing houston smith and that's true but a mystical experience does a materialist unmake and i think it can undo some of the metaphysical constrictions of our era and open us up to a deeper understanding of what's actually taking place once you dissolve into the intelligence of the universe the intelligence of the mind of the universe and into the compassionate center of the mind of the universe it radically transforms your understanding of what life is about what we are doing here what the process is and that has enormous ramifications and i think we will be moving in that direction but first we have to earn the right in a way we have to earn that access through demonstrating its clinical effect efficacy i am not a clinician i'm not a psychologist i was not primarily interested in healing i was trained as a philosopher of religion and i simply could not wait for us to get to this point in time if i had waited for us to get to this point in time i would have missed the opportunity of a lifetime so i did the work i did underground undercover privately quietly i wish i didn't have to i wish i could have done it publicly i wish i could have been in public discussion during all this time but i did it with the belief as the early researchers did that there will come a time when we would reclaim these sacraments and that we would begin to systematically harness their deeper potential and i think that's where we're going there is a movement among the pharmaceutical industry that wants to make money off these substances to try to strip the magic out of the mushrooms you know to basically extract substances which come from the psychedelic substances but do not induce some of the more exotic or demanding states of consciousness that these substances do in their natural state so that they can give us a pill which you can take every day and then they can sell us every day and because psychedelics you can't make money on psychedelics because you don't use enough of them you know you only use them intermittently and the healing effect is so powerful that you don't need to take them every day right the pharmaceutical industry wants to make money off of them and i think that's a danger and that's work we have to really watch that i also think the medicalization of psychedelics is also a danger it's understandable that it's important for the scientists to maintain research in these early years but i think entering into these states of consciousness is a human right and i don't think it belongs it doesn't belong under the governance of the medical community only i think we're going to come into a point where we recognize that there is a broader community of specialists who are skilled in navigating these landscapes who are not necessarily mds and phds you know in the movement there's various organizations that have formed to be structured around uh what you call sort of the therapeutic use of psychedelics and i wonder if in the future there might be institutions structured around the more philosophical or cosmological explorations of the kind that you did what you imagine those might look like i think it's just a matter of time i think there will be in the near future there will be clinics institutional settings hopefully deep in nature settings where people who want to explore the deeper dimensions of their consciousness can go and do so under careful uh supervision they can do so safely there is backup but they can do it in a non-clinical or non-medical set of expectations it's kind of like the transition from taking birth out of the hospitals into uh turning it over to the midwives where you have medical care nearby if you need it but birth is not a medical procedure birth is an entirely natural procedure likewise opening up into deep levels of your own mind and the mind of the universe is not a medical procedure even if medical medicine can be very helpful in the early stages so i would anticipate that when there will be organizations there will be structures places where you can go to work with sacred medicines various psychedelics in a safe and effective manner which go beyond therapeutic healing is i think it's just a matter of time what kind of affordances might those structures need that might be different from a more like clinical or medical treatment therapeutic usage well first we should recognize that humanity has already been doing this for thousands of years that there are in among the indigenous people among the first nations peoples among the in america among the indigenous peoples in brazil or in south america they've been working ceremonially with sacred substances for hundreds thousands of years so we we have a great deal of historical precedent for how to do this how to open up not only individuals but whole communities into sacred space and bring the entire community back and put them through a series of exercises so that they come back grounded really well grounded into their physical lives we're we're not reinventing the wheel here we really have much to learn from indigenous people and first nations people on how to work with these substances now there are screening criteria you you really want to screen people who are going into these states there are some people who really should not be entering into these states either because of physical health problems that they're carrying are psychological problems that they're carrying it's just not a wise procedure to adopt if you're carrying certain tensions within your body and mind so there there is a place for screening but the cultures these indigenous cultures they knew that they screened it even though they didn't have md's screening the process so it's simply a matter of building on what we're doing incorporating the collected wisdom from indigenous cultures and moving in to create our own unique forms coming back to the sort of vision for humanity at large do you have any advice for the coming generations well the first thing i would say is that i think we know enough about the universe through reincarnation if you really do your homework and you really look at the data if you look at the data from near-death episode research if you look at the data from out-of-body research we know enough just enough to know that we choose our incarnations before we were born we made an informed choice of the life that we were being born into so at a time when we knew more than we remember now we made the choice to live the life that we're living now not that we could see every detail but we the fundamental core components we could see before we were born and that means that whether or not we have conscious recall of that choice i think we have reasons to be confident that we are where we belong as we enter this time in history that all of us every one of us has volunteered to participate in this very very challenging time so that's the first level is to be kind of centered in your core and knowing that you don't have to run around and you don't have to go someplace else or do something else that you were already planting yourself on a trajectory that allows you to participate in this process and this process is the process of the transformation of an entire culture it's going there is not one person or one type of person or a healer or therapist or artist that's going to make this transition work it's going to take all of us it's going to take all the skills that humanity has to make this work the real question is i think not how do we how do we do how do we engage this process meaningfully so we can help us transform the real question is do we have the courage to do which we know we can do what is at hand do we have the courage to really enter into this process consciously and that means we basically have to have the courage to become the future human that we know the world needs we need to become the human that the world needs in order to survive this crisis we need to become more compassionate we need to work to create a culture which is more egalitarian more fair more just we need to show greater respect to the earth and to our the animal cousins who live on this earth with us we need to basically become in our own personal lives what humanity is trying to forge in our collective life more where and that means doing inward practice it also means doing outward practice of social transformation clearing out our own hearts of anything which keeps us small and helping clean out those things in our culture which keeps our culture small and focused on values which are destroying the earth thank you for sharing that and uh also for answering all my questions and speaking on so many topics i i wonder if there's anything else that you'd like to say or or talk about we are coming into a hard time in history we're coming into a time when decade by decade things are going to be getting worse and worse there will be tremendous social anxiety and personal anxiety as we basically inherit the consequences of our abuse of the earth for all the hundreds of years that we've been creating this extractive economy but i hope in everybody's own individual spiritual practices one encounters enough of the universe to experience the profound wisdom the great intelligence that's behind this moment of transformation and the great compassion and love that's behind this time in our history that this is not we are not victims this is not an accident it is a time that calls for us to become the heroes that we have the possibility of being that we really nothing less than deep deep heroic sacrifice and actualization is called for but the universe will support us every time we make a change to live to the larger good the universe will support us it will it will help us overcome our shortcomings this is you know this is the game of life this is the great time of our life in the end we don't want to live a comfortable life so much as we want to live a life that's meaningful and this is going to give us all an opportunity to live very meaningful lives i appreciate you putting that in perspective and uh speaking so clearly about it thank you for that and thank you as well for your time today it's been a real pleasure to speak with you tazim thank you for this conversation thank you for the conversations you've been having with many people uh all focused on helping us know more and become more that we have the possibility of becoming thank you you're so welcome it's a it's an honor and a privilege so thank you</p></body></html>

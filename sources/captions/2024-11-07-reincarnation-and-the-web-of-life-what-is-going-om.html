      <p>[Music] welcome to what is going home for New thought from the edge of M each week on M times flagship radio show veteran broadcaster author and media consultant Sandy sedge beer conducts thought-provoking interviews with inspirational authors artists musicians scientists speakers and filmmakers who are working at the point where spirituality and science meet Consciousness at the very edge of om here is your host Sandy sbear hello and welcome today we're going to be talking about life after death Heaven and Hell and reincarnation Christopher bash is professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University adjunct faculty at the California Institute of integral studies a Meritus fellow at The Institute of noetic Sciences and he's on the advisory Council of gr Legacy training an award-winning teacher and international speaker he is the author of four books including one that I rate as one of my favorite of all time LSD and the mind of the universe diamonds from Heaven which Chronicles his 20year psychedelic Journey exploring Consciousness and the other book which we're going to be discussing today is life cycles reincarnation and the Web of Life which combines scientist testimonies about reincarnation with the synthesis of findings from Consciousness research and near-death studies Christopher bash welcome back to the show hi Sandy it's a pleasure to be with you today you too so life cycles has been held as the first book to both describe the Dynamics of rebirth and explore the ramifications of adopting a reincarnationist perspective now this was published what 35 years ago thereabouts yeah so that was right after you had started your journey with LSD how many years into that journey and how did that Journey Inspire this well I started my uh psychedelic work the after one year my first year of being an academic and I worked for four years and then I stopped for six years and during that six-year interval I did uh three years of past life therapy uncovering and working with my own former lives and I wrote life cycles uh so my psychedelic work by that time had reached deeply enough that I had been given many personal insights into Karma the deeper cause and effect that underlies our lives but at that time I had not had um personal experiences of my former lives in a psychedelic context I had in a hypnotherapy context but not a psychedelic context but it really was my study of Ian Stevenson and then later other uh Pioneers in the research uh documenting children and adults with validated verified past lives memories uh that really became the foundation for my work in life cycles yeah I mean you shared a few of those stories um which I have you know read before and they're absolutely fascinating because the whole circumstances there's just so much evidence there that you know you really can't question it one of them that really interested me was the child um who um you mentioned Dr Helen wach who um had a a patient a 5-year-old girl who rejected human contact and withdrew into childhood autism but somehow she demonstrated mathematical and reading skills which she had not been taught um but she she would not communicate but then over the period of their um work together she showed Dr wach the how she felt what she was feeling by Force feeding her with you know a a baby bottle because she felt totally totally you know that she was being treated like a helpless infant yeah and when and when the doctor um you know understood that then the child started coming into herself yeah but she lost the reading and she lost the mathematics I mean stories like that are just you know what do you make of them well what I make of them is that um life is much long Our lives our personal lives our let's say our individual lives are much longer than we presently tend to think that they are and that they're always beginning and starting and there are overlaps and once you understand the larger life of the Soul then this kind of continuity of qualities Knowledge Learning attitudes traumas uh virtues uh that are kind of blending from one life into the start of another life where we pick up and continue to the learning I'm making it over simple overly linear and overly simple but that basic idea that there is a blending we don't start our lives a tarasa we don't start our lives blank we start our lives with a history which is a specific history which we can see very clearly when we begin to look at children with fresh eyes H why is it the last it's always the last life you know that they seem to talk about well it's not always the laugh last life actually in the literature Stephenson's research focuses on children who have an active recall of their most immediate former life their last life but remember that Stephenson's research is addressing a very uh unusual population children who have spontaneous memories of their farmer lives most people do not have spontaneous memories of their farmer lives his children are reincarnating very quickly compared to the population at large only an average of two and a half years and very close to their life circumstance of their previous Life 50 years studies which look at larger people larger populations of people who don't have spontaneous recall indicate a a longer time frame between lifetimes and a much broader geographical radius so it's it's so it's that is a little bit of a distortion from the research protocol when we look at uh therapy people come to the therapeutic literature people come to therapy because of pain and sometimes this pain is grounded in something that happened to them in their recent past their recent incarnational past but not always sometimes it comes from several lifetimes before so the way I think of it is our former lives are like a deck of playing cards we may have had 52 lives but only a handful of those cards are active in this present life and those let's say five cards come from different centuries and only weave together certain elements of those five lives into the composite that makes up the present life so when we when we kind of develop a more textured understanding we begin to understand that it's not a linear development from life to Lifetime is that we go back to the soul the soul holds all of our former lives and then the Soul decides which of those former lives in which combination it's going to Incarnate into as the next Incarnation Yeah you mentioned the word soul but in the book you make um you know a distinction between soul and over Soul yeah so what is the difference well uh and then at the end of the book I dissolve that distinction but the soul the the distinction is that for westerners who are accustomed to thinking of the Soul as the spiritual essence of this present lifetime we need a larger concept of soul to include all of our former lifetimes and for that I use the concept of the oversoul borrowing that term from other other people at the end in the end of the book I say it gets increasingly cumbersome to maintain this Division and for me the word the soul and I usually differentiate it by capital S soul with a capital S is what I mean by the oversoul the Consciousness that holds all of our lifetimes soul with the small s is the Consciousness that's integrating all my experience expences in this Incarnation so the overs soul is what some people would call the higher self the part of them that you know continues forever yes I think so yeah so I was doing some research today and I came across this article on psychology today by Dr Alex lickerman who is um a Buddhist um but he doesn't believe in reincarnation but he said that the real question at the heart of reincarnation is not one of evidence but one of identity yeah good point I I haven't read that article I'd be interested in in seeing what he says uh yeah I think once you move into a reincarnational worldview the concept of identity ex shifts and expands because I accept this body and my personality as my current identity and you know if I have deep mystical experiences of Oneness with the universe that I would accept a universal Cosmic Principle as my deeper identity the concept of the soul is kind of intermediate position isn't it because it's on the one hand it's individual it's because my soul and your soul are different in that they reflect different histories and they have an individuated quality but if you ask the question what is the essence of the Soul what is the essence of that spiritual identity then it comes back down to the same mystical insights the essence of one is the essence of all the essence is the essence of the Divine some would say of the cosmic intelligence the cosmic principle but it is the question of identity is really quite critical shifting into a reincarnational worldview doesn't undermine the value are the Integrity of this identity but it recontextualizes that identity within the Soul's identity which is is the metaconsciousness which holds the 100,000 years say of identity of all of our lifetime experiences it's you know it's very hard to um believe that you have a different identity that you are not you know this thing that you've lived with um for so many years it's even harder to think that actually you know the oversold or that essence of you is infinite it's lived forever and it will live forever I mean that's a hard one to get your head around well it's hard in the beginning but it gets easier uh with practice both intellectual practice but particularly with experiential practice and exper itial access it's one thing to be intellectually convinced by the evidence that reincarnation is a principle operating in life and then when you begin to look at life through that lens a lot of things begin to make sense which didn't make sense before and that deepens one's sense of opening to that but when you actually sort of turn within and follow your awareness deeper within your own Consciousness so that eventually it Taps into levels of your own self-awareness which predates your physical body and you learn the stories of that self-awareness that come from another life and those experiences of that former life have a a distinct quality of being you while being other than you but you know that they are you and if you encounter several such lives and you die dialogue with them and you work with them uh then it kind of has causes a dilation within your not only in your thinking but within your heart that it becomes easier to accept this Transcendent though individuated but Transcendent Dimension uh to your identity it just in eventually it becomes it hard to think smaller than that it actually becomes hard to take this as your only identity that just you I'm going to ask you some questions some of the most common questions that crop up with this subject and you know the first one is why do we really incarnate ah well to learn to grow to become more than we are and that really kind of gets down to the very basic question what is the purpose of existence and if we think we don't reincarnate if we only live one lifetime then if there is a purpose to existence it must be something that can be realized within however many years we have in one lifetime but if we live an open-ended number of lives then it invites us to expand our understanding of what the universe is doing in us with us with all that time and so it opens up an open-ended developmental possibility we now have an understanding of the universe's time frame for the creation of galaxies and planets and systems and so on but we we've been excluded from that because we haven't had a sufficiently ex expansive understanding of ourselves reincarnation invites us to open up into an expansive understanding of our individual participation in the cosmic unfolding and so we have all these lives in order to learn more to become more to actualize more and it it's not simply a matter of becoming enlightened though that's a noble gold unto itself it's Enlightenment is simply a stage on in an evolutionary progression which extends far beyond Enlightenment I mean if you just think ahead what will what could we become if we had a million years more or a billion years more I have a problem with this because if we are sparks of God yeah if we know everything when we leave and many people say suddenly they understand everything and you know they're in a whole other kind of you know their awareness is so expanded why do we need to learn more how much more is there to learn aren't we complete when we're there but then we actually you know kind of regress when we come here and I don't understand the point of that yeah well that would be like asking too a real good question when the infinite before creation before manifesting the physical Universe why would the creative principle manifest the physical Universe which almost is inherently less self-aware lefts knowledgeable and I think it's not so much we do expand our knowledge much much more when we are when we die whether it it seems like it is infinite knowledge maybe it is but maybe there's even more than what we think of as infinite knowledge but the real question becomes if God were to come to us and say would you help me grow this universe would you bring as much knowledge as you can into your person and help me grow this universe into a higher form of physical manifestation of our spiritual nature so it's not simply what happens to us when we die I think we get a glimpse we expand we get a contact the question is who would turn down the invitation to actually participate in a creative process which will produce higher and higher and higher deeper and deeper and deeper forms of humanity in evolution in history so that truly we will eventually be able to make Heaven on Earth we won't Simply Be imprisoned and dumb and stupid when we incarnate we will be enlightened we will be infinitely aware in our physical Incarnation I think this is the trajectory that we're on so it's becoming more and more uh and participating in the dance of creation you know I can I can follow that some of the way I you know yeah I'd be there saying yeah I I'll participate but the fact is you know to then come here and forget everything and to really be living like you're starting all over again you know all the knowledge all the wisdom that you've gathered over all of those years what happens to it but we don't forget everything do we because we we may lose a fair amount of our conscious recall but what we have known is built into our unconscious recall just like these children who may not remember how they acquired that mathematical knowledge or other kinds of knowledge but it's there we not may not remember how we develop the capacities that are now na natural to us but there is a history behind everything that we are so we don't really forget it all we just forget some of it but we bring a lot of it into our very being and then we ex we express that knowledge in our life and we develop so that by the time we finish we have become more we have incarnated more completely some of that knowledge than we were at the beginning of our lifetime so many you know we've all seen mediums who bring loved ones you know to people um how is it that if somebody has passed over and they're either in the BAU or they're reincarnated or they've you know they're doing whatever they're doing how is it that they come back you know they can reconnect to that identity in that moment to give that you know yeah bed loved one Whatever message they need yeah yeah well now we're getting into the nuts and bolts of the Soul it's a good question and I'm going to give a short answer to a long a long question um this is an an ideal scenario but a not uncommon scenario I think when we die we return to the soul and after a transitional period where we evaluate our current our past life and we evaluate what went right what went wrong and we uh assimilate that learning we return to the soul and we begin to naturally exchange but we might think of as our small identity for our large identity our hundred-year identity for our 100,000 year identity so that Chris bash no longer lives just as Chris bash but is restored to the the total knowledge of my soul now let's say my father died when I was 18 okay so when I die I may want to see my dad and if I want if I get the opportunity to see my dad whether or not his soul has incarnated an aspect of him in a subsequent Incarnation I think it works something like this when my being wants to meet my dad his soul comes to me but manifesting the front image of that Soul would be the being that I had known him as which would be my father so Chris bash would meet his father but soon before too long it would it would be a matter of soul to soul so Chris bash's Soul would be meeting my father's soul and we would be having a much deeper conversation than simply Chris Bay speaking to his father now we're having a cosmic conversation now I think a the mediums can contact uh people who are discard it but that we should be careful before we infer that the form in which the medium encounters them is the form in which they are truly existing in their post-death state I think a lot of our Fascination and compulsion even to communicate with those who have died in the form in which we knew them reflects a limited understanding of what happens to us when we die and it tends to reflect a western understanding that when we die we are judged and we go to heaven or hell or Purgatory or some level of the BAU and it's a pretty shortterm concept I am not particularly in interested in communicating to my father as I knew him when so much more uh could take place in in our Exchange so in a sense you know the um the soul of the person that comes through for somebody is in a way doing something with compassion and they're just stepping into yeah they're wearing the they're wearing the compassion the presence of the that this person had known them as and communicating to that person through that persona but that persona isn't necessarily who they truly are now you know another common question um is uh and until I read this book I didn't know how to answer it is um well how you know how can there be reincarnation there's far more people on the planet now than there were you know a thousand years ago yeah yeah well you know answer with an analogy start there if you were at a university and the university had six th000 students and you never left campus you lived on campus and there was a rhythm every semester there were fewer people that went home and then every semester they came back but over a few years you would notice that the population of the campus is getting bigger and you might wonder where are all these extra people coming from but but of course they're coming from a town outside of Campus which is a much much larger Town than the number of people on campus and I think it's like that in with reincarnation we have no reason for believing that the number of souls available to Incarnate is finite or that it's small and that all of them were present at some early point in uh Earth's evolutionary history and therefore we have to explain where all the extra souls are coming from perhaps there are billions of souls in line waiting to take up positions as positions become available in the earth school we have no reason for believing that the number of souls is finite or that they were all present on Earth in the beginning so we just have to open what the invitation here is to open up to understanding that the spiritual universe is many many times larger than the physical Universe Robert Monroe who working aob body work in the Monroe Institute emphasized this over and over the physical universe is a small slice of reality most of reality is spiritual but wasn't it Robert Monro who also said that um some humans involved evolved from higher animals yeah actually that's the uh that is the common view of most reincarnation societies that is if we look if we follow the line back and ask where where does reincarnation begin they generally think that it doesn't begin with human consciousness it begins farther back in our animal pedigree so reincarnation seems to be a dynamic that is correlated with the birth of individuality grass hard to see grass as individual but sooner or later we have individuated Consciousness emerging within the animal kingdom reincarnation seems to be a function of that individuated Consciousness in exploring and empowering and expanding itself and that starts before human beings now we're actually getting uh I think it's Dr Linda Beckman who does a past life regression who was trained with Michael Newton and he told her that the time would come when many people's the lives they accessed were not lived on this planet and that's actually happening she said I mean her books are full of stories of you know people's experiences that they connect with previous life somewhere else entirely well we would have to ask at least on a theoretical level why not if we just look up at the universe and and look through the Hubble telescope and all wonderful images that are coming to us and we see life burgeoning and star and planets why shouldn't there be evolved life on those forms and if reincarnation is possible then why should it be only be restricted to one star system why might not there be some type of interplanetary um crossovers I don't have any personal experience of that myself but I know that she does and so I I think well that's interesting it is interesting it is we're going to take a short break now now you're listening to what is going on I'm Sandy sbear my guest today is professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University and I won't read the rest of what you do other than you're an international speaker a teacher and an author Christopher bash and we're discussing the compelling research and the tantalizing questions raised in his book life cycles reincarnation in the web of life still to come what happens to those identities that we once thought were us why was reincarnation removed from the scriptures why is our time between lives as important to our development as our Earthly phase and more stay tuned Times TV hello I'm Sandy sbear host of om times

ambassador and a force for positive change own times open yourself to the possibilities everything that we do we can do in a contemplative manner through the art of contemplation you can use the Jean keys in a really powerful way genan Keys is basically the code book of life in the Jean Keys the book is made up of these three levels Shadows gifts and cities and the journey is from is through those three levels kind of unpicking of the Shadow States the releasing of the gifts and then the embodying of this higher Consciousness called the city and the city's a very exalted words and it's not like we we kind of suddenly are all these exalted Christlike beings but we have flashes and illuminations along the journey and the more we get stuck into the journey the more illumination comes to us because the more we're releasing the light from in these codes inside our DNA so all those Revelations are inside us so the contemplative way is the inner way There are 16 million children struggling with hunger in America that's one in five daughters Sons neighbors and classmates who don't know where their next meal is coming from yet billions of pounds of good food go to waste every year it's time we do something about it feeding America is a nationwide network of food banks that helps provide meals to millions of kids and Families in Need visit feedingamerica.org to help them feed even more together we can solve hunger together we're feeding America welcome back Christopher bash so I'm rather attached to this you know person personality um the thought that it might disappear at some point you know like um an actor just shedding a role that they've played um take off the costume and never to be seen or heard from again you know who said never to be heard and seen from again well in that form oh in that form well in that form you know it's it I don't like that idea I mean I'd like to know that you know maybe I could connect with her sometime maybe I could even bring her back yeah and be that character again do you think any of that is possible well I think the the the essence in the system of Our Lives is preserved beautifully intact when we die we take with us not only all of our memories but we take with us a living and Vivid version of the experiences that we had on Earth in Technic color and stereo as the near-death episode experiences have shown us when they have uh when they relive their life they relive it in much much more detail than they were ever remember remember having it in the first place so not only do we continue perfectly intact but we continue in this super saturated version of ourselves and all of that is taken forward all of that is brought into the soul and the Soul can crystallize its larger Consciousness in any of its forms or it can actualize all of their integrated Consciousness into a singular integrated form and in the end I I'm only willing to give this this 100 years if that you know it's it's just you know it's just too limited I mean why ride a bicycle when you can have a spaceship I mean it's just it's so much so there's no sense of sacrifice I think there's there's a sense maybe of trading up you know sometimes I think that I'm I'm not very um elevated in my in my Consciousness you know and if I have been alive for Millennia then I'm really not doing a very good job I like to think you know after all of that time that I'd be further on um you know I tend to look at things like people or beings like Spirit guides and angels and ascended masters as um they were once you know just as human as me me enjoyed a human life perhaps and have reached such an elevated State I mean is it conceivable that I could be one of them one day well yes of course it's conceivable because your essential nature already is one of those beings but let me just kind of flip this a little bit I first I just I've been teaching this stuff for years and I had just generations and generations of students come through my courses and one of the things I've learned is you can't judge you can't read a book by looking at the cover you can't judge a person's soul development by looking at what they're dealing with and it's kind of like at a university somebody can have developed a great deal of expertise in music for example but then they decide to start developing an expertise in their art and so they let go of their expertise in music in order to start a whole new course regimen in art and if you were to look at only what they do in art you might think oh this person is a freshman when really they're very sophisticated senior with all these other skills and I think it's also that way for the soul too so I mean I mean look at what you do you're an enormous influencer you're you're hosting one spiritual dialogue after another you you're touching thousands and thousands of people's lives what how could your soul if your soul were in the BAU say in in in a pre-incarnate state and you were given the opportunity to bring down some sense of what you know some aspiration some uh capacity and enthusiasm for exploring spiritual knowledge but not by yourself in a monastic context but in a platform that reaches out into the world at a time in history when the world needs this type of knowledge so my basic senses don't sell yourself short I mean I think there are many more bodh satas in the world than we think um yeah you're I'm sure you're right okay so another question white light several spiritual teachers are of the opinion that we should not go towards the light as we will be trapped in cycles of reincarnation they say they say you can bypass that and go somewhere else what do you think of that one well it doesn't make any sense to me it doesn't compute for me uh to me the white light just at a simple level when we separate from our body the white light is our homing Beacon uh taking us back home taking us back to the our essential nature our deeper Spirit our deeper divine nature now the basic classic idea is people instinctively move towards the light and they move as far towards the light as they feel comfortable and at some point along the way for various reasons people feel less comfortable or they feel sort of it's more natural just to stop and drop drop off and at that they're at that level of Spiritual Development that they feel most comfortable in the thousands and thousands of levels of the BAU uh and so the the admiss the admonition for and from that level they will eventually go through a process in which they will make the choice to Incarnate again the admit uh admonition in most spiritual Traditions is to do a kind of training that allows you to be comfortable with the light so that you can follow the light all the way home all the way through all the levels of the BAU all the way to the most intense form of that light which res Ides within what the Buddhist call extra samsaric reality so a reality which is outside the entire reincarnating universe altoe so to me whether our journey into the light takes us back to our own natural level of peak spiritual realization or whether it takes us all the way back beyond all those intermediate levels to the highest level um it doesn't make any much difference uh to me it makes most sense to follow the light all the way as far as you can yeah well you've seen that haven't you I have and it it touched me in a way that has affected the entire rest of my life yeah yeah so why was um uh reincarnation taken out of Chris chisanity I mean for the first 500 years of Christianity it was a vital component and then Justinian removed it yeah well that's a complex story and and that that I was first an historian of early Christianity that was my first academic love and the search for the historical Jesus was my first I did my masters at Cambridge in the search for the historical Jesus and it's it's a complex process and I don't think the definitive story has yet been written um did Jesus teach reincarnation it certainly is present in some of the Gnostic Gospels uh but do those Gnostic Gospels reflect the actual teaching of the historical Jesus and if Jesus did teach reincarnation then we have to explain why it was filtered out or if he did teach reincarnation why isn't it more thoroughly saturating the earliest level of the scriptural tradition however we answer those and I we don't have the time to answer those today it clearly is the case that there were multiple variations of Christianity in the early centuries and some of those variations taught reincarnation and they also taught uh the empowerment of women that that women should have clerical capacities and responsibilities so on so forth and both of those elements were filtered out of the tradition um it is gettis McGregor who is a Christian was Christian Theologian wrote numerous books on early Christian thought around reincarnation he was of he's of the opinion that there is nothing inherently contradictory to the belief in reincarnation and the teachings of the essential Jesus kind of the or early early core teachings of Jesus but it it gives an individual too much autonomy for their spiritual welfare in the historical context of the collapse of the Roman Empire the emergence of the Catholic of Highly centralized Authority the church saw this highly centralized network of priest Bishops Cardinals the pope as essential to the Salvation of this salvation of the church and therefore to all whom the church served so I would give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they thought they were doing a good thing by really creating this system that made individuals contingent upon the intermediate cler clergy and the authority of the church now from a reincarnational perspective they didn't do a good thing uh it took us a long time to uncover this deeper teaching that where each one of us is responsible for our relationship with the Divine the the church may help us but the end in the end uh the church is not essential to the maturing of our relationship to the Divine well I have another question about that I mean you you devoted you know chapter 6 to the question of whether there's room for reincarnation in Christian thought about 35 years ago you know I'd like to know in a minute if your view on that has changed but before we do that I want to make sure we get this one in talk about the hidden phase of Life the time between lives which you say is just as important to our development yeah and and that's actually why I named the book life cycles I wish I had named it a little bit differently because it became acutely uh um significant to me that if you look at the cycle of life as only taking place between birth and death you're missing half of the cycle we miss what happens between death and birth and you have to look at the whole cycle to understand the rhythm of the soul the rhythm of human consciousness and so there are just as there are kind of standardized gradations of what happens when a child is born there there's a standardized process of what happens when we die and I think Michael Newton's work is the some of the best work I've seen explaining what happens in the minutes hours years Rel you know using time in a non-time universe uh after we die the integration the the introspection the review of our most recent life looking at it deeply from within a spiritual perspective uh looking at our relationships and our challenges and uh from a relation from a deeper spiritual perspective integrating all of our successes and failures um really internalizing them entering into the civilization of Spiritual Beings in the civilization and in the community of fellow Soul Travelers uh and enjoying the the recess the the return to a more complete spiritual awareness of existence and then in time a gradual focusing into the next challenge that we set for ourselves because it's like a university you finish a semester you take your exams you digest and rest for a bit but you make then choices for what you're going to take next semester and mutant mutant shows that these choices are done not by ourselves but under the guidance and and tutelage of our guides our senior kind of more senior uh Spiritual Beings till and we have some insight into the lives that we're choosing we have options and we we make a choice that this particular set of challenges suits my particular needs where I am in my development or it gives me an opportunity to be of service in ways that I haven't experienced before U and then we make those choices and then we've engaged the incarnational process and we wake up Kicking and Screaming as a newborn child if you understand the whole of the cycle then you be have a much the beginnings of a much deeper understanding of what makes life tick in a human psyche than if you only pay attention from birth to death so I I was doing some research on statistics and I discovered that um it seems you know very obviously uh rough um numbers but uh something like over 57% of people in the world believe in life after death between 12 and 44% depending on you know which country you're um looking at um believe in reincarnation 75% believe in heaven yeah and hell you know which makes me wonder because if you know only 57 believe in life after death yeah where's that extra you know where do they think Heaven and Hell Is I don't know yeah what do you have to say about heaven and hell and and 25% of American Protestants and about the same percentage of American Catholics believe in reincarnation that's the one of the statistics that that really blows my mind heaven and hell you know I think in some ways the Buddhists get closest to it and their basic vision of is when we die we enter in a universe a stage of our life where what we are is mirrored back to us in our in our experience so if we've done good in life if we've been generous and kind and and thoughtful then that is mirrored back to us in the experience of heaven or the Heavenly beings if we've done harm and injury and selfish and stingy things and hurt people then that is simply mirrored back to us not out of punishment but to educate us and this is the experience of hell so from this perspective hell is the experience of our shortcomings Heaven is the experience of our Joys and I think that work and and Newton his cosmology seems to integrate that but this is U would be mistakenly could be mistakenly interpreted as a cosmological absolute when really it's simply a stage in our debriefing it's a stage that we go through uh I think the deeper reality is that there is a heaven of Heavens there is a heaven beyond the heaven of our feedback to our own goodness there is a heaven of Heavens a reality of infinite love Infinite knowledge infinite Bliss within which the entire human evolutionary Saga is just a small piece and should not be taken as defining the limits of the universe is there similarly a hell of Hells is there an eternal hell and I absolutely do not believe there is it has not been so in my experience at all that is simply a theological mistake a mistaken interpretation now I think there is accountability there is we are responsible for the actions that we take and there is an accountability nobody gets out Scot free but that accountability does not include this loathsome idea of Eternal damn or Eternal punishment no mother or father would do that to their child for making mistakes and likewise the Supreme intelligence of the universe would not do that to human beings now having said that let me step into something different as you know from my book you know LSD in the mind of the Universe I have entered and spent many years and Days in Hell Realms in experienc ing extreme torture of that that looks like a hell realm and I my understanding eventually of this is this just as my individual psyche retains all my individual memories both good ones and traumatic ones there is a consciousness of the human species which retains all of its memories and processes all of those memories in a central meta psychological condition what Yung call the collective un unconscious and that means all the terrible things that human beings have done to each other all the Wars all the horrors and all the injustices and all the rapes and the pillaging to the extent that those have not been clarified or healed or removed they become part of the collective torment the collective shadow of humanity so you might say that within the human psyche there are clusters of memories that have a hellish quality but that doesn't mean that there is a cosmological state of being of hell because just as individuals have bad experiences that they can then clear from their system the human species can have terrible trauma which it is in the process of clearing from its system okay and I think that in the early church maybe some of the people who had contact with these Collective hellish Realms mistakenly interpreted them to as a cosmological principle of eternal hell well just we've got about four minutes left Le less than that quickly go back to this question whether there is room for reincarnation in Christian thought you say that it would only take a small yeah I think we're of course traditional Christianity would say no there's no room for it whatsoever one life eternal Hellen but I think there are many Christianity has committed itself that if anything can be demonstrated as a fact then we'll find out how it works and work it into Christian Theology and if reincarnation is demonstrated as a fact which I think it has been and is being then Christianity will find out how to how it works and how it makes how to make room for it all we have to do incorporate reincarnation within a Christian framework uh is expand the notion of the age of the Soul we can even give Jesus a unique role in Salvation history if we want to we may choose to expand to see Jesus as part of a whole brotherhood and Sisterhood of Awakened beings helping Humanity but even if we wanted to make Jesus the unique sal sal savior of Christianity all we have to do is open up the notion that this the Journey of the soul is a journey of maturation that takes place over many lifetimes it's not finished in one Lifetime and all of a sudden the inadequacies that have been foed on Christianity by this terribly shortsighted assumption that we only have one lifetime so if you only live six days and you die there's a consequence to that or if you are a bad person or you do something bad in the first 10 years of your life you could go to hell for the rest of your life these terrible consequences the kindness of the universe The Compassion of Jesus has much more room to grow in a world which understands that he's talking to souls he's not simply talking to personalities he's talking to souls in his teaching last question very quickly you in the book by talking about the Web of Life understanding The rhythms of our life as an ongoing dialogue which is you've kind of covered in what you've just said more or less is there anything that you want to add to that I've lived in the reincarnational worldview so long and I've I've taught it and and talked with people and listened to their stories and processes people's life experience that it is so natural to me to understand the uniqueness of every soul and the uniqueness of every Incarnation and the complex background web between lives and circumstances that to see life in the old way what I used to see it in this kind of Silo way is completely unnatural intellectually and spiritually untenable and spiritually unnourished so to me reincarnation doesn't answer all our questions but it is the beginning of deeper and deeper and deeper questions and deeper answers which brings a true richness and a deep satisfaction to the life process it it takes out this terrible horror of a good God who I think I'm gonna have to cut you there it looks like we've gone over time I'm so sorry but that's okay what can I say you know talking to you is always fascinating s thank you so much for joining us today thank you Sandy so life cycles reincarnation and the web of life is still available in paperback format and for more information about LSD and the mind of the universe

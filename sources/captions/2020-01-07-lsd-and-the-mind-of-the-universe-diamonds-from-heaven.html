Katherine MacLean Ashley booth from the aware project Mitch Gomez from Dance save as Shannon Claire Carlin who helps run the MDMA therapy training program at maps in Mark Gorman Jessica Katzman society who does ketamine assisted psychotherapy we've got all sorts of great stuff up here Raquel Bennett who runs the Korea Institute and in the Korea conference really big Anna ketamine as well and more so check it out psychedelics today calm or a psychedelic Education Center calm you can learn more about our navigating psychedelics for clinicians and therapists classes start in February we have course times that are friendly for a European audience and a American North American audience too so right around 7:00 p.m. Eastern and 7:00 p.m. London time I believe but the time specifics are on

other side hello everybody welcome back to psychedelics today today on the show we have Chris page retired professor and professor emeritus at Youngstown State University and author of the recent book LSD and the mind of the universe we're also going to be doing a giveaway so stay tuned on that Chris thanks for joining us so I I had been talking about you I think even a couple years ago when I found out about your your kind of long-term project before probably the book was even with a publisher and I and I was really excited by the idea and then I just totally forgot and then all of a sudden we got connected I think through the publisher and know I'm very excited to record with you because this is quite the project you've undertaken and you've got some very unique insights to share how do you how do you like to start this story like how did maybe maybe we can start with psychedelics how did sex telex come on your radar initially well I just finished graduate school I was publishing a few articles out of my dissertation I was looking for where to take my research I was a brand-spanking-new University professor and I met the work of Stan Grof and that's what really snapped my head to attention I did not have a psychedelic history I was I finished graduate school and religious studies as they pretty deeply convinced atheistic Lee inclined agnostic but I read Stan's work and light bulb went off inside of me and I said this is important not just to psychology but it's important in philosophy religion which was my training and I wanted to get involved I wanted to it but of course it had been made illegal so I split my life I in my ordinary day job I continued to function as professor of Religious Studies in the department thought conventional kind of courses or semi conventional courses and I began a 20-year what became eventually a 20-year journey working with LSD following Stan Grof paradigm and then pushing the limits of that paradigm pretty far much farther than I appreciated it time hmm and I was trained in philosophy of religion so I kept careful records careful notes tried to make the engagement as clean and this productive as possible and I knew there would come a time sooner or later when I would share the experiences or share the insights from the experiences with a broader audience and after I retired from the University that time finally came I'm perfect and what was the first proof did you have any kind of previous spontaneous mystical experiences or anything before that that kind of lead you into how important these things might be now I've always been envious of people who have had you know I was twelve years old when I had my first Ponte Gnaeus mystical experience and that's not the way it's been for me I've always been kind of deeply locked into my body and my physical experience you know I I was reasonably well educated in Western religious thought I became educated and Eastern religious thought and a broad spectrum of contemporary thought but no I had no background in many ways I'm the last person you would have expected to write a book on me on deep psychedelic states of consciousness it's just I mean I grew up in Mississippi and I got a degree in theology from the University of Notre Dame before going on to graduate school so this wasn't part of my background at all I'm curious how did you stumble across a stands work by not having any exposure psychedelics beforehand well I was reading widely in different areas I was reading and kind of emerging transpersonal psychology it interested me two people that whose work I've met my first year out one was Ian Stevens and his work at the University of Virginia convinced me that reincarnation is a simple fact of life and that was a jolt because it hadn't been part of my education anywhere and then I met Stan's work and he had just published two years before realms of the human unconscious and that was a book that really did it for me and so Ian gave me kind of empirical evidence that there had to be another dimension of reality other than the physical world because there if there is any time interval between the death of one personality and the birth of the second personality there has to be a place for them to exist during that time and Stan gave me the methodology that allowed me to the prospect of exploring that reality so I just decided to go for it it's awesome so maybe next like what what did the protocol look like to you like it to me it looks like a very clearly looks like the work being done at Hopkins and by maps now but was it any different in your perspective at this point no I think it's pretty much conventional in that respect you're always working in complete isolation you're always working with the sitter you're always working with the very carefully curated playlist of music the differences after I did three medium dose LSD sessions and then shifted to working with very high levels of LSD so I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms at first I did it simply for our efficiency because it was hard to get time in a build career marriage or you know arranging a session day and I wanted to make the most out of every day I also thought it would get me to my early goal with enlightenment faster if I could Kennedy do my Karma and bigger bites that eventually is a project that just dissolved along the way in the whole concept of a personal spiritual journey or strictly personal evolutionary project that fell out along the way so the difference I think is the quantity the polyp that first the psychedelic use is very different than psilocybin their MDMA working with very high doses which changed the whole trajectory of the experience and then I basically began to curate a much more aggressive playlist with the music I used a lot more indigenous music I didn't use classical Western music I use a much more aggressive approach in music itself but otherwise very much like contemporary therapeutic approaches to psychedelics yeah huh I guess track a little bit too so your book really kind of covers these was it 73 high-dose session so we like your book is covering all these insights of your experiences and some of your philosophical work and really understanding consciousness from these experiences so I don't know I forget if we gave it a little show there so that's just to give some context of what we're talking about and what Joe meant about protocol of how you're setting that up and I'm curious why did the music change over time I happened upon some indigenous chanting music and I threw it into my session on the next day and the next week and it had such a profound impact on the intensity of the session it basically rattled my cage much more aggressively than some of the more even aggressive classical music I like the effect I recognize it's out of more disorienting more giving me stronger support for going deeper into consciousness so I just began to cultivate and collect the type of music yeah that's really interesting and from your perspective how important is music when you're doing high dose psychedelics or just like it all like kind of therapy and that self-discovery format I think it's very important now I've done sessions without music eventually after long down the road and I've done psilocybin sessions within the path music but and working with a very strong psychedelic like LSD and working at these very high doses which by the way I don't recommend I truly do not recommend that people do what I did I wouldn't do it the same way mm-hmm if I did it today but basically when you're working with opening consciousness that radically music is it has a tremendously powerful effect I would maybe estimate it has a concentrating amplifying effect by five or ten times doing it without its psychedelic or without music so I remember that and I started using music only in the fourth session and the jump that happened in that fourth session was just enormous so I think it's very important yeah it's the topic that keeps coming up I guess within the psychedelic community especially when talking about putting playlists together for therapy and I just recently recorded an episode with a fellow who composes music and ended up taking his experiences and making music out of it so yeah I think the music piece was just really interesting it's a huge part of breath work as well yeah yeah Helen Bonney of course her early work clapping the various stages of an LSD journey and the characteristics of music that support each of those stages as we go important work yeah so where did this idea come from of wanting to engage in this these high dose sessions like did you start off saying I'm going to do you know X amount of sessions and really dive in or did you go in saying I'll have a few and then see where it goes or just you have this idea kind of mapped out of doing X amount of sessions or had a goal with it at all no I did not have any trajectory or any goal I saw the range of experiences that Stan described in realms of the even unconscious I saw you know I since I had a pretty good grounding in Western philosophical thought and theological thought I had a good sense of the significance of these states of consciousness that he was describing and believe that the people who would be making the most important contributions and my discipline would be speaking out of an experiential basis in a matter of years not out of a theory simply a theoretical basis this was common in my time so I just I knew that to do that you just had to get in and do your work and I had no idea how long the work would be I was still thinking in the early years so you know you can basically go through ego death and then you get unrestricted access you know to the deep consciousness of existence what I found of course is that it's not a matter of simply of shattering the ego and going through ego death the universe has many many layers and while it's all holographically integrated in a sense if you engage the universe systematically and with the carefully defined kind of methodology the universe takes you in by degrees it takes you in by layers and as you move into a new layer of consciousness and your consciousness stabilizes at that new layer sooner or later if you keep pushing it the method you're using has sufficient power to take you to the very edge of that new layer you're going to go through yet another death and rebirth process it's different than you go death the bills upon that process and you go through a series of death and rebirth processes and as you explore progressively deeper and levels of consciousness and at least that's how it happened for me it may be different for other people and different substances but how it happened to me there was a systematic progression entry into communion with the universe and that's where I laid out the book I just basically took it in start at the beginning try to I try to describe the recognize the levels of consciousness that I went into consolidating the story to make it as efficiently conveyed as possible and then each chapter basically goes into another level of consciousness or another level of engagement with the universe how would you I guess define that layer of consciousness like like what do you mean by that of getting to these next layers you know sometimes you hear in like the New Age like oh you send 3d to 5d and maybe that's how you know some people are making sense of that but how would you describe that moving through layers well I adopted the working vocabulary that Stan has developed in his books of between psychic levels subtle level and causal level consciousness differentiates low and high psychic low and high subtle and low and high causal and that's a vocabulary that works for me of course the universe is so deep and has so many hundreds of levels those are just approximations and I don't have any vested interest in a particular model of the universe our model of how many levels of consciousness there are when I was going through and writing a book and looking back retrospectively at where this journey went and how many core death and rebirth cycles there were there many sons like as a death neared birth but four fundamental death and birth cycles and therefore of different levels of consciousness from the roots into I found I differentiated five levels the first takes place at the personal mind the level of personal mind and that culminates in ego death where you lose your ego occur time-space identity the second takes place or took place for me at the collective mind its dynamics fundamentally at the early subtle levels of consciousness it has to do with the species mind dimensions of species existence the third level is archetypal mind where when it's moving into the highest level level moving beyond simply the collective consciousness of the species moving into different levels of archetypal reality the fourth for me is console mind causal oneness free moving into profound states of non-dual reality causal reality and then the fifth is I called I'm luminosity or particularly the clear experience of ultra-clear particularly clear dimension of life and there are many many different you know degrees of life that one encounters the closest I could find in the conventional spiritual literature to this was in the Buddhist concept of dharmakaya the clear light of absolute reality the light that pre that exists prior to of the Big Bang right standing in kind of talks about that with his first LSD experience right yeah we're talking about is you know for seeding and way out yeah yeah thinking about these levels of consciousness and thinking about this like kind of news that you know like Renaissance with psychedelic therapy how important do you think it is for therapists to kind of understand these these levels of consciousness when working with clients if you're going to be a psychedelic therapist of course because there are many different levels of consciousness as a therapist one works at different levels of consciousness so I don't think a therapist has to have deep familiarity with all the levels to work at the early levels I think conventional wisdom it's a good wisdom that if you're going to be working with clients going into deep non-ordinary states of consciousness you must be personally familiar with those states otherwise how can you be the stabilizing factor in the room when someone is losing their mind and is terrified of losing everything they'd love to be real but you haven't been there yourself if you haven't learned to let it go how can you help someone else let go at those deep level so I think it's very important and that poses a challenge of course in trainer academic therapists because we're in this gray period down but that's going to be changing you know we're gonna be moving into a different legal environment soon I hope look that you guys are doing and other people are doing is really creating new possibilities but I think you know personal experience is really Metiria yeah thanks for that it's been a hot kind of topic I guess people have been exploring should therapist really understand this this these layers of consciousness and these experiences to be a guide yeah she's interesting this whole idea of yes you can get this training but you don't necessarily need a session but then there's this whole vast realm of religious and philosophy like this material that discusses all of these states in kind of a literature form or we can go experiential with it too and I my problem lately is I really want a very strong argument for this and I haven't really personally been able to come up with one a strong argument for the importance of personal experience here at least personally at least personal experience but the point I think that you made which is unique is there's these very complex spiritual experiences you can have transpersonal experiences you have and that's not really discussed in the literature as far as I can tell in terms of that at least the recent literature like how do you talk to somebody about this you know yes you became Buddha for millennia and now you're trying to you know work at your day job again what what do you do but yeah any comments on that kind of thing well I think it's important for people to have a good solid theoretical grounding I mean I think it's important to read deeply in transpersonal psychology and works like Stan Grof and the various people who have been guiding people or taking people into these domains and a compiled book large database experiential database but if you don't have personal experience of these realities you're always working at a disadvantage and you can have a verbal understanding of what it means to go through into certain territories but if you haven't some personal exposure of this territory you're going to make mistakes you're going to draw inferences where an experienced journeyer would not all those inferences you're going to find correlations where there aren't correlations you'll miss correlations where there are correlations these are very very complex experiences I mean my journey lasted from 79 to 99 I'm covering a 20-year spread I didn't publish this book for another 20 years and partly that was because of the legal complications I had to retire from the university before I did this but partly it took me years during the sessions and years after the sessions to work out the complex overlapping phenomenology of these states of consciousness and you know if I were I mean I think the word guide is maybe not the best word I mean that implies a role of active in guidance have acted the direction which is not really the case for I think working with much of this work doing much of this work to be a sitter to be able to hold the ground to be able to help somebody go to the edge of everything they know to be real and true about themselves and of the world and help them jump over the edge to give them the support that they need to lose their mind to really let go of everything they know to be real and true I don't know how one can really do that without having first-hand experience of those domains and so to that extent the I think the effectiveness of therapists our sitters will be limited through their own depth of experience they can be very very good and skillful at levels one two perhaps but maybe not so much at levels three four or five or whatever you get the sense of it great yeah that's right that's kind of interesting to think about even like practical stuff like going to different people for different like sessions maybe I mean obviously you have no idea what the hell is gonna come up right but somebody focusing more on personal dynamics right and I think it's good right now we're proceeding very slowly very methodically we're using gentler psychedelics as no federal protocol suggesting using LSD in the quantum the high levels that I used it and I think that's it that's good that's important it's important that we proceed methodological carefully we have a window you know we lost our window 40 years ago yeah the window is back and it's important that we move very judiciously as we expand that window but sooner or later we're going to find what we found in the early years of psychedelic work and that is feeling the personal unconscious is only the first step of a long journey into the universe into the deeper dimensions of consciousness which take us into the I don't know what do you call it I think of it as the mind of the universe the mind of the cosmos it's like I hesitate to call it the divine mind or the mind of God because that language has very strong cultural overtones that I don't really want to pay for it but when one dissolves when one completely dissolves a time-space level and just dissolves into increasingly comprehensive fields of experience and open realities to you that you've never even dreamed possible and if you go back again and again and then the article way levels of consciousness and at first swallow you up whole and it's very very hard to stay consciously aware at these new levels and that's why I think we often call them ineffable but right if you go back consistently over and over again what happens is you acclimate you learn how to stay conscious at levels of consciousness that previously were not able to stay conscious in and that's a pattern that repeats itself as you go deeper and deeper yeah I find that to be really true are you familiar with this gentleman uh Kalindi ie from Detroit I'm not he is a very strong proponent of these high-level doses and I I struggle with his arguments around it but but yours a you know it seems quite sensible it's you know how do we approach it I'm not a proponent of high doses myself I mean I did this work I came through it see in the early years the early high dose work done in Spring Grove hospital with terminally ill patients well it's limited to three sessions low dose psychedelic work open-ended high dose work was limited to three sessions and I thought going into it I thought well if you could do it safely three times you could do it safely more time what I found was that by doing it as systematically as I did and pushing that edge as hard as I did it required that issues arose challenges arose which had not been discussed in the early levels of the work opportunities for insights and understanding emerge but also challenges navigating these increasingly intense levels and large levels of consciousness and what it does to your body and mind and as you go into these realities and how it affects people around you mm-hmm I found that my students never knew about my work I mean I kept my work completely isolated from anyone on campus but I found at a certain point my students began to be activated by my psychedelic work there was a natural contagion that was happening because consciousness at these deeper levels is open-ended it's like a lake you to a rock in the lake the ripples spread out so when one person goes very very deep people around them are naturally going to be impacted and I had to learn how to take care the activations that my students were experiencing that's I wrote the book the living classroom s the read that came out of years and years of trying to understand this dynamic between my mind and their mind and our minds together in the context of you know consciousness at large so it's not just a matter of taking care of your own body and your own emotions and your intimate relationship since taking care of everyone who's touched by you work at a larger collective level I wouldn't push it as hard if I were doing it again I would it's not that I would avoid working with high doses but I would balance it working with two lower doses and I would balance working with LSD which pushes a high cosmological ceiling with psilocybin work in ayahuasca work is much more kind of embodied psychedelic States yeah man there's a couple questions I want to ask you nauseous direction I want to go into but I want to come back to the this idea the the ripples right because I've thought about this a lot and I'm kind of curious what your take is on this of having some of these experiences and I've even had it in breath work sessions where it's like tapping into I guess how you express like this this lake you know you kind of toss it in and there's like ripples and time wave or something like that where all these kind of synchronistic things might start happening and I'm wondering from your perspective you know you're talking about your students changing do you think that was more in the sense of your presence and the way that you are showing up or do you think it was kind of more in that subtle realm world where you're going into these states and it is having more of a ripple on some other sort of level I think it's in both and I think it does ask my work changed me certainly my presence in the classroom changed but the more interesting aspect I think is working at the subtle level I mean I began for example I found that when I was lecturing and just just looking for a random example looking for an example to illustrate some concept that I wanted to make you know was bringing forward and I would pause I would just stop in my mind would go blank and I this idea would come to me to give this example I would use that example and students began to come up to me after class and began to say very quietly when they were sure no one was just you know it's funny you use that example today because that's exactly what happened to me this week and this I thought this was just you know an interesting accident but it kept happening and happened repeatedly not only was it happening frequently enough but I knew it was it had to have some significance but the deeper I went in my own work the more students were being touched in very very deep private personal areas of their live lives places where they needed healing places where they were blocked places where they needed some help getting through to the next stage of their own development so as I was kind of facing my blocks and entering into deep communion with the intelligence of life It was as if the very fabric the intelligent fabric around me was being activated and triggering these kind of ha moments with my students and and their own confrontations with their blocks and the students knew that something unusual was happening I couldn't exactly explain what it was but I had to you know we all knew something was happening so I would have students taking my courses aren't ly for the intellectual content partly because they wanted to be in the energy of the room mmm but I found it wasn't just that there was a resonance spontaneously occurring between my energy and their energy there was a second phenomena that I discuss in the living classroom and that is the affective group feels wow that is that just like more for genetic feels Rupert Sheldrake's concept of morphic fields except these are smaller these are not species widefield these are more specific fields I found that there were there were psychic fields growing around my courses that were getting stronger year by year the more students studied with me in these courses and it was a field that was being generated by their learning so hundreds and hundreds of students learning over many years creates a field that was impacting and accelerating and deepening a learning of subsequent students and subsequent semesters so it there were multiple factors on going into this phenomenon yeah it's super fascinating and I don't know how to make sense of it at times so yeah I think thanks for sharing that but you know it turns out that once you let go of an atomistic psychology once you and it's not that atomistic psychology is really true that is the psychology which treats our individual consciousness as the individual standalone phenomenon we know that that's true but underneath that is a quantum reality as a quantum psychology and once you let go of this idea that everything that happens around us can be explained in terms of the of the aggregate of simply individual awareness and open to this larger participatory cosmos where there is a deeper context it's like a deeper time that's always moving in and out it's always flowing it it actually becomes very coherent it's very easy to understand it says that you have to shift your metaphysical basis right yeah that makes sense that makes sense it's like plate tectonics you know in the early years it was very very hard to see that just looked ridiculous but once we began to see it and a whole lot of data began to make sense and it was elegant and simple and transparent yeah I'm curious also to kind of go back to that idea of kind of incorporating mushrooms and ayahuasca you kind of said that it seems to be a little bit more body medicine could you talk about the difference between your experiences with LSD and the more plant-based psychedelics this is a question that we we've been asked a lot and I think we even chatted about in our course last three nights ago of like you know what is the dream stream like LSD is is that a little bit different like I vote like somebody said oh I always heard it's like more psychological than say you know more kind of like biographical and doesn't have this like spirit right where you albert hofmann so right he said psilocybin seems to be something in there right so yeah I wonder what your take is well inevitably my take is based on my own personal experiences so it's always dangerous to generalize on the and then up one so I just don't want to over generalize psychedelics which have been used historically have feels associated with them so we've been using mushrooms for thousands and thousands of years and I think there is a certain sense in which around the biochemistry of this substance they are fields which human experience of human beings engaging the deeper dimensions of their own consciousness and consciousness at large using this substance and when one takes this substance you don't just introduce a chemical into your body which then you have a private experience of this substance but there is a sense in which how the substance affects you is mediated in part by the history of your species with this substance and I think that's also true with ayahuasca the visit you know multi thousand year history surrounding ayahuasca with LSD we don't have those fields I mean LSD is a new substance and I don't think the difference is fundamentally organic versus synthetic I don't find that discussion terribly illuminating I mean our experience in the sixties and seventies that's that's a few decades that's not a whole lot of experience when it comes to these types of fields that I'm talking about so in my experience living quality that kind of living intelligence quality I'm sure that there are spiritual agencies on the other side which may account for part of that and part of it I think has to do with humanity's living experience with these substances and all the experiences I've had with them LSD strikes me as kind of cleaner in that respect it doesn't have that same kind of programmed quality now I don't know what it would have been like if I had been working with low doses of LSD if I've been working with low doses I'm sure it would have activated out my experiences would have been much more personal and psycho dynamically oriented but working with the very high doses that I worked with after the first 15 sessions are so when the sessions were at their peak hours I was not working in relationship to my personal psyche at all in fact pretty much in the book I I drop out the personal story as much as possible because the personal story kind of showed up at the beginning of a session and at the end of a session and these were very meaningful experiences to me they're very healing they're very you know helpful giving me insights to relevant things in my life but during the peak hours I was usually operating are beyond the range of personal psyche when I'm working with psilocybin I don't have that experience of being so far removed from my personal reality I don't have I only have limited experience with ayahuasca I like the medicine very much is a very powerful medicine it's been giving me some extraordinary health and extraordinary clarity here and there but I don't have enough experience with it comparable to my 70-some high dose set LSD sessions to do a careful a be my basic sense is that the cert assignment tends to be less evocative less disruptive less opening up to the deep deep levels ayahuasca is more disruptive opening up to deeper levels still and at least for me LSD working with it as I did opens up to very very deep cosmological levels eventually I don't know of people I have not seen though I haven't tried to do an exhaustive search in the literature but I have not seen people having experiences with psilocybin and for the most part even ayahuasca that correlate to the experiences I was having in the last 10 years of my work with LSD but again that's just my personal experience it's you know it's not a scholarly Ryerson right yeah and what were some of your experiences like towards the last ten years like I guess yeah could you give us some examples of like those big themes that you're working through if it wasn't so personal or psychodynamic well you know that's a hard question because there's so many levels and there's so many of some it's it's always tricky to kind of jump into the latter stages because every stage builds upon earlier stages but Ray one of the one of the barometers I would mention for example would be time when I went into subtle level reality I for a year I had a consistent set of experiences where I experienced the totality of my life from beginning to end at simultaneously present in in immediate now so I I not only had insights into my old age and I didn't experience my age in a sort of abstract theoretical way I experienced the distilled essence of my entire life boiled down to right now and all of the data of my life was present at this particular moment in time this was such a mind shattering possibility that when I first came back out of this experience I couldn't remember it it took me entering into it multiple times to be able to really be able to hold on to all of those experiences which I write about in the chapter called deep time in the soul going beyond that I began to enter into archetypal dimensions of archetypal reality I began to have experiences of something like the Platonic domain of the reality behind time-space reality except it wasn't archetypes like Plato conceives of them Plato conceives of archetypes as unchanging ideas in the mind of a transcendent intelligence my experience these ass huge beans that were so huge I couldn't wrap my mind around them I the best my mind could do in imaging I'm was to sort of see them as galaxies and I think this simply my mind's attempt to image something that one would measure in hundreds of thousands of light-years of scope but these were beings that were responsible for creating time and space and orchestrating the unfolding of reality in time and space I went into into what I call deep time which is not eternity it isn't timelessness but it's different magnitudes of time experience within the simultaneous or broader frame of reference so I had many experiences and became one of the overarching themes of my book of my sessions and therefore the book of humanity's future where humanity was going what our moment in history was what the archetypal trajectory of humanity was what was happening behind the scenes in this global sustainability crisis that we're entering into what I have a chapter in the book called the birth of the future human lots and lots of going into deep time on going deep into humanity's future experiencing what is attempting to be born in this period of history whatever how evolution works on this larger broader scale and then eventually going deep into various episodes of call someoneÃ­s Shunyata emptiness the experience of primal void you know the void is behind physical manifest existence experience of cosmic law because of just being overwhelmed with and I think love is basically a kind of characteristic can be inherent oneness of life we really deep deep oneness that existence is then you know the emotional counterpart of that is loves compassion at the motion of oneness and then eventually going beyond oneness Beyond and the void into this diamond luminosity state which once I touched the diamond luminosity this occupied the last five years in my work once I touched it it was a state of a state of being state of consciousness so incredibly clear so exquisitely clear that once I touched it I wasn't interested in exploring any of the other dimensions of consciousness that I had been exploring for years returning to that condition became my sole objective mmm the next in the twenty six twenty six sessions covering four years of work I only touched that condition four times and in between those four sessions were tremendous cleaning tremendous purification tremendous detoxification so that I could return to that condition and experience it more clearly more completely so this there's a lot of levels and yeah that's what makes the story complex story to tell yeah well people should check out the book and read through all this so yeah yeah that's nice now that the book is out you know they don't have to get it from me speaking you know I've done my best to tell the story as cleanly and simply as I can with without a lot of the philosophical baggage that may have been in some way earlier works right is there a story that you'd like to tell the most about your project that that maybe you could share here or any any kind of specific Jim you like to share the most you know it's a story of a journey and every phase of the journey was an exciting adventure in its own right at the time when I was entering into that territory and each one was absolutely fascinating and captivating to me when I was going through this and so I don't have a favorite per se I mean I think of course the diamond luminosity is from my own personal heart that is the deepest dimensions of the story the deepest aspect I think the story of the birth of the future human where reincarnation is taking humanity is an important component of the story because I what happened to me in one particular session in the 38 session without this cutting down to the important piece here is that I began to experience all my lives coming into the all my former lives there kind of being integrated I've done a lot of other works hypnotic regression work to familiarize myself with some of my life history but I experienced all my former lives coming in very quickly it was like wrapping string on around a tight school hmm and they came a moment when all of that energy with all those living experiences they fused and when they fused they ignited and there was a tremendous explosion of diamond light from my chest and it threw me into a completely different state of consciousness and and I think what I was being shown in this experience what I was being given was an understanding of where reincarnation is taking us because classically reincarnation you know leads to a gradual hopefully of yet most sustained development more compassion more understanding developing our qualities of our deep essential nature more and more richer and richer levels we make mistakes we go back we we learn we go forward in this process but I don't think the process is really about taking us incremental II to eventually producing a better life which is incremental II +1 from where we were previously I think eventually if we die and we expand in the Africa death condition we're born and we contract into a immediate one life focus we die and we expand or we go back and forth and if we keep this up just for hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of years if we keep this up sooner or later the totality of our consciousness which most people would experience only after they die a deep soul sooner or later that soul consciousness I think the evolutionary trajectory is for this consciousness to wake up inside our physical incarnation and that's what I call the birth of the diamond soul when you wake up and we are not tempted to identify with simply egoic this body mind kind of structure that we know ourselves to be an internal being we know ourselves to be in relationship with other eternal beings we have a fellow sense of history with many many of these beings and the compassion that comes with that history and a sense of open transparency to the cosmic intelligence at large I think that's basically where we're going and I don't know I think this is not a private experience it's a collective experience the universe doesn't work in small numbers the universe works with all species and what's happening is really an evolving of our entire species in the direction if they're one thing I guess I keep I would come back to one thing which I wish I could tell us reach into my heart and communicate the people it would be to let go of this terribly constricting fear of death because if we're afraid of dying we've got it all backwards you know here's where the hard work is done when we die we have all this Hollywood [ __ ] about what happens to us when we die and most of it most of its just trashed right when we die we enter you know we go back home we enter the vast majority of us entered pretty very easily straight into the depth of where we come from and there are many layers of that reality so there's a lot of work to do but there's absolutely nothing to fear and death one of the things it's come out of my work is I just I don't have a fear of death I mean dying it's a nice but being dead has absolutely no seriously in fact it's something I look forward to very much Kyle how do you respond to that that resonates a lot with me of what you're saying like kind of gave me a little bit of chills so I don't know if you know my my story listeners probably know this we've been following us for a while but when I was 16 I had a near-death experience and so ruptured my spleen when I was in the MRI or the cat scan machine I was overwhelmed with this this blissful feeling of love and beauty that was going back home and there is a sense something came over me and said you're going back home you're going to you're going back to the stars where we all come from and this you know physical life's gonna cease to exist but you're gonna continue on and that was really beautiful and it wasn't scary when I when I first heard I was dying and it's like they said you know you have internal injuries you're losing massive blood I thought it you know I was pretty terrified but in that moment as I was shifting away total acceptance and so I actually had a really hard time coming back here right because yeah and I could probably resonate with that idea the diamond loose luminosity of wanting to return there because I definitely resonate with that feeling of wanting to return to that oneness that I felt on that night and that's what got me into like exploring psychedelics is having very similar experiences with psychedelics and correlating that to my near-death experience and wanting to get back there and over time and maybe you'll resonate with this is like the period in between of stopping and actually focusing on the integration and I keep coming back to this idea that the work is here this is where all the magic happens and how do we really an audio that and show up yeah yeah to to complain about the restrictions of time and space is kind of like a weightlifter complaining about the weights and this is worth this is where the work is done time space is an extremely demanding environment but with progress made here has exponentially important for what we're what's available to us when we die from all the various populations people I feel the closest affinity from my own psychedelic work are the near-death episode people I thought near-death episode research for years at my university in one of my courses and so I've really read deeply in the near-death literature and that's the closest correlation I find with the deepest of the psychedelic experiences very strong correlations and can ring was one of the near-death showed you know one of the founders of that movement and I have we've written together and dialogue together he's a good friend around that yeah yeah it's it's a powerful topic yeah something I think about often right yeah and I guess my early experiences got me really on this path was just like you know I enter this space where just felt so similar with like this I had an experience with psilocybin we're just so on par with dying you know just captivated my attention of how could a substance like this I mean I guess in a sense you know if you take it from the second therapeutic like lens it's like reliving trauma right I'm kind of my psyche is processing that experience and I'm going back there to kind of reprocess it but you have plenty of other experiences where it still felt pretty similar and on par with that original near-death experience yeah I've died many times I mean I feel like and that would be old impetus in the early work at Spring Grove was to give people a foretaste of where they're going going and they died and you know I've gone through that in charman's this is very for their territory so there's nothing unique to be there but I've gone through that death process so many times it's it feels very comfortable and very natural and coming back is sometimes challenging I mean a hardest chapter for me to write in this book was the last chapter coming on the mountain it basically tells the story of what happened after I stopped my sessions and I basically entered into period eventually a deep existential loneliness I found that I had really worked very hard in integrating my sessions I did all of all but very carefully I wrote them down I studied them I tried to incorporate their teaching into my life I really thought I had it you know locked down pretty well and I thought therefore that I could stop my sessions and I would just be able to kind of collect and ponder the many gifts that I had been given through the years what I learned was that integrating an entire journey is different than integrating individual sessions hmm and that by repeatedly going deeper and deeper and deeper into the universe and experienced the exquisite ecstasy of dissolving into sheer light repeatedly and entering into dissolving into the crystalline body of the divine when for various reasons I made the decision that it was time for this work to stop I found that I had a I was suffering from a loss of communion mm a deep deep existential sadness and eventually years down the road I found that I was really just waiting to die mmm that I could return to the light and I realized you know that wasn't right that's not the way this work is supposed to end and you know my entire body was screaming failure to integrate yeah but because I had been so careful trying to integrate it wasn't clear what the where the imbalance had come in what I found eventually is that it was an imbalance that had I had cultivated inadvertently between transcendence and imminence it's all in the divine the physical universe is the divine I knew that it was the divine I knew that we're never absent from the divine for any moment it's only our own illusion so people see that sense but I had pushed so deeply into transcendence in this to a certain degree I had lost footing in the imminent divine and I had to make a conscious choice and and undertake specific practices to really kind of ground myself back in the imminent divine for the remainder of my years on this earth it took about 10 years mm-hmm I mean really get solidly comfortably back inside my time space suit Wow I could imagine after 20 years of deep exploration I mean that's a I'd say that's probably a pretty long integration process yeah yeah and that's I think you know this respect my story is sometimes described as a hero's journey but it's not the hero's journey the way it's usually thought of it's not really going and experiencing something and bringing back you know something valuable for your culture for yourself you know it's all it's tempered by its tempered by a kind of lesson that comes from dealing with not the failure of some aspect of the journey but actually of the success of the journey of being wounded by the sheer beauty of what one experiences you literally are wounded by the beauty of the universe by the experiencing the extraordinary intelligence of the universe extraordinaire in love of the universe and if if you're not able to create a container inside your historical existence where you can breathe this intelligent skin and breathe the compassion in then you know it's like it literally can kind of become painful mm-hmm so it my story isn't part of a it's a cautionary tale it cautions against and even though I tried to be as methodical as possible and do it as carefully as possible and integrated as deeply as I could it cautions against going too deep too fast if you can call 20 years too fast going too deep or deeper than you can actually productively use and I think my memories have changed not only the the rest of the years of my life but my memories have changed the trajectory of my own Souls entire evolution so I don't think of the results of my journey as necessarily coming to fruition in just you know the next few decades I think they come to fruition over lifetimes it's changed the entire trajectory of my deep evolutionary project and I think that's true for anyone who enters into this you know em you enter into deep intimacy which life in this way you purifying your purifying you off throw a lot of you know painful trauma whatever whatever but you also open up to a different a different relationship with the universe so I right now my primary way of being with the universe in this intimate way is not working with psychedelics that time of my life is largely over I'm 70 years old and this is you know somewhat of a young man's game young person's game I I do a lot of content area of classical contemporary practice I do a lot of Audrianna practice which I find to be very complimentary to keep psychedelic work I don't feel any cross purposes between the two different work methods of working I should mention in this context though I think it would be a mistake to hold to sort of evaluate the value of psychedelic eep psychedelic work by holding it accountable just to the Enlightenment project I started this work with an agenda of an Enlightenment project what happened was my personal Awakening was completely eclipsed eventually by a project of a collective awakening all my work began to be focused on a type of healing of the collective psyche that went beyond my personal healing and on awakening of the collective psyche it went beyond my personal awakening and then it became just a radical adventure a cosmological adventure going so deep that it would be impossible to bring those experiences back and stabilize them in a some kind of spiritually awakened state it's just a different project because the Enlightenment project and cosmological exploration project these are two different projects that have to be evaluated on their own terms my two cents now yeah I would agree yeah yes this is quite the interview certainly like much I knew it was gonna be a big topic but I'm always impressed by how big some of these things become and yeah I I do think some people are doing similar projects nowadays though yeah I want I wonder if LSD is still in vogue in this context I don't know I worked with LSD primarily because that was the work that standard done most of his early work with and I trusted what I saw in Stan's research and I trusted that the history there in the methodology he developed I only began to work with other psychedelic substances pretty much after my LSD work was done and so the mind that I brought to my psilocybin experiences and my ayahuasca experiences in Southie atiba norm so on and so forth the mind was that the mind that had been transformed by all my previous psychedelic work which is the other thing too you know important to take account of that the mind experiences that we have reflect the entire history of our working in non-ordinary states of consciousness so if we've done this where only a few two or three times well then we have that kind of deficit experienced we bring to it but if we've been doing this work for years and years and years and actually these substances are going to have a different kind of effect right because we've been transformed the way I think of this is that listen my experience the universe is an infinite ocean of possibilities it's just an infinite ocean of will never ever get to the end of it I think and we'll get to an end state that was the project to get the thing let me get to the end condition that was taken away from me along the journey I began to understand it's an infinite infinite progression I get distracted from my original point by that particular particular image yeah I'll just stick with that I lost my train of thought but all that works for us because it's our orientation is this graph en meets Whitehead and John Cobb kind of synthesis and yeah you know largely this that's at least the project of the company here but yeah it's it's good to hear that you know it innit it rhymes in a sense with that Bodhisattva vow of let's keep going like there's not this endpoint of Nirvana until everybody's there and it's gonna be a long long time if time even enters into that discussion it's a long time except of course it's feeding up you know it's kind of like our collective karma as a species just coming out it's hard you know the whole history you know our culture is basically a culture that's been built by ego and for all the many virtues and values of the ego it's basically it's fundamentally a fragmented condition and therefore it creates the world is deeply in balance with between ourselves and between other life forms and you know that world is coming to a radical and accelerated breakdown and and I think this is I could part of the evolutionary pivot that you're coming into a time where we literally will not be able to continue operating out the same not just an economic or industrial or technological basis but we will not be able to continue functioning out of the same psychological basis of your consciousness so how fast we might make this transition if we use historical projections from the past would probably deeply underestimate how fast this could happen in fact in that chapter in the birth the future human where I talk about particularly one special session fifty-five it could be deep into the death and rebirth of humanity the message that kept coming through over and over and over again was this is going to happen much faster than anyone could've met his imagining gonna happen much faster hmm you know so I think we're the game is getting very very intense we're being driven into Mon linear dynamics little feels that you're conscious that no collective psyche is being hyper stimulated by the trauma that were going into and when systems we know from physical systems from physical systems enter into nonlinear conditions they can do things that they could not do when they were in lower energy linear conditions and I think that something similar happens with psychic fields the integrated psychic field that holds all of our individual minds and that psychic field is hyper stimulated by the suffering that we're going into but it's hyperstimulated moods who will eventually move into a nonlinear condition and the rules of nonlinear conditions of dynamics apply to psychic fields as well as physical fields small changes can elicit huge outcomes latent connectivity which was kind of invisible at the linear level becomes suddenly active and visible at the nonlinear local things can happen much faster at the nonlinear level in a linear level so you know we're going into a trial my fire and I think this trial is actually part of the con intention of the creative intelligence itself I don't think it's accidental and I don't think they're any victims here you know personally my own personal believe this we all chose to be here we chose to be part of this time in history yeah it's extraordinarily important time to be fully conscious and fully active we can make sure thinking about that and it's interesting it does feel like things are really kind of speeding up and you know sometimes I'm like oh you know you always kind of hear that as you get older time seems to be speeding up but even you know talk to people that are older and things just seem to be happening quicker and quicker and it is really interesting do I can't like hold on to anything you know it's like once you kind of grass onto it something else has already changed form you know it's yeah yeah so many of our not only our technology is driving yeah this way but our social customs you know just they're dissolving right out from underneath does the standards of truth are changing and it's a confusing time and it's a it's a dangerous time and it's a hard time Wow it's an extraordinarily exciting time it is do you see psychedelics aiding in this in any way yeah absolutely I think that the ways in which psychedelics have come back into our culture both from the Central American and South American cultures which have kept this tradition alive the the new psychedelics ease you know LSD is often compared to the atom bomb raids they were discovered at the same time this exponential this opportunity to explore dimensions of consciousness that previously previous generations for the most part and classically have had to spend lifetimes meditating in order just to get access to some of them and now people of even modest spiritual capacities can have temporary experiences of these realities which have a profound they require a profound redrafting of our essential assumptions about how life works and that we can do this we can engage these these dimensions of consciousness up for recreational purposes - not even for healing purposes we can engage them systematically for educational and deep transformational purposes not only for our own personal transformation but we can we can work on behalf of the collected in these states of consciousness I mean I think psychedelics have just they have that's that's what I saw when I first read Stan Grossberg I thought wow this is going to change everything it's going to be a true before and after development we're gonna it's like the invention of the Essie scented microscope or biology and the telescope for astronomy it just increases the quantity of data we have access to so that it changes it forces a radical revision of our theoretical understanding I think psychedelics are part of it and just in time as we haven't very little time yeah yeah it feels that way yeah it's coming out it's very fast very fast cool so I hate to end the podcast but we're at over an hour and I don't I want to be respectful of your time and I really appreciate this this is a very enlightening episode can you tell us a little bit about where people can find your book and perhaps the upcoming audiobook they can find the book on Amazon I'm just putting the final edits on the audiobook I'm not sure that will be released through inner traditions I'm not quite sure what the vehicle will be for that but it should be out hopefully by the beginning beginning of the year I will have a website hopefully by the 1st of the year I'm Way overdue in revising this website and getting it posted but eventually within a month or so people will be able to find me at Christmas calm that's going to be the easiest way right now most of my written work and some tapes are collected at academia.edu under my name you can find them listed there but right now I'm not as good on social media as I should be it's hard to keep up with ya only do one it's not worth being with ya the most what's really exciting is the book is finally out and it's as clear of presentation of this material as I've been able to take me five years to put it together and bring it forward and it says it's as good as I can tell the story well thank you for all your work and really appreciate you joining us on the show today thank you guys it's been a real honor I really

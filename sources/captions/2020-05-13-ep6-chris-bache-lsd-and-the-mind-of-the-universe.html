      <p>okay welcome everybody to the naked guru experience I'm Ryan Kemp just as a little forward this discussion is part of a series in tribute to the American ethno botanist Terence Mckenna and is sponsored by the psychedelic society as ever it really helps in the production of these discussions if listeners subscribe to our YouTube channel today's guest is Christopher M Besh chris is an emeritus professor in the department and philosophy religious studies at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years an emeritus fellow at the Institute of noetic scientists he is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of integral studies and on the advisory board for the growth transpersonal training and got the Groff foundation an award-winning teacher an international speaker he is the author of a number of books including life cycles dark night early dawn and the book we will be discussing today LSD and the mind of the universe diamonds from heaven in which Chris catalogs his epic journey over 20 years where he engaged in 73 high dose LSD sessions working at 500 to 600 micrograms Chris welcome to the podcast and thank you so much for agreeing to this discussion hi Ryan it's a pleasure to be here with you today so we have a lot to cover in just a small amount of time and I just wanted to say from the start that your book has been profound in my life and it's in huge discussion around the world on multiple groups I know the feedback from many others it's been life changing for many others so thank you for your work um thank you I just like to start with a little introduction to you in your background and influences if you will please Chris well I'm the last person you would expect to have written this book I was raised in the deep south who grew up in Mississippi I studied theology at the University of Notre Dame I was actually in the seminary for three years in high school and one year in college I did my masters at Cambridge and New Testament criticism I was going to be a New Testament scholar shifted out of that got my PhD from Brown you diversity and philosophy of religion but when I came to ysu and I was looking for the next area to focus myself I was trained in philosophy of religion I encountered the work of stanislav grof who was it was life-changing I also encountered the work of Iain Stevenson whose research on reincarnation was life-changing yeah but it was Stan's work particularly that seemed to set the course for my life I was I understood immediately the implications of his research for not only psychology but for philosophy the opportunity to develop a new philosophical methodology the systematic exploration of consciousness through the discipline deuced of psychedelic states now of course the United States had made psychedelics illegal at that time so I divided my life in half in my daytime job I was a professor at the University teaching courses in Eastern religion psychology of religion comparative mysticism of course called transpersonal studies and then I began in my personal life a very private exploration of the my deep psyche using Stan Grof protocols for a psychedelic therapy and then pushing those protocols to their limits to explore my consciousness and through that exploration what I came eventually to understand was the consciousness of the universe itself brilliant brilliant now a lot of what we're going to discuss in in this talk there'll be people within the psychedelic and psychological and even spiritual community that will be very familiar with what we're going to talk about and our terminology but there is a good I'd say probably even a majority of human beings on our planet that that are not aware of of these kind of psychological landscapes and the terminology so for me I think it would be helpful if you could please frame for us the context that we're talking about when we discuss LSD a lot of people see this is a discussion on drugs when actually it's a discussion far from it from something far more profound yes yes yeah we all kind of suffer from the carryover of our experience with psychedelics our cultures experience in the 1960s and all the negative press that psychedelics generated or were generated around psychedelics when the true story is really very different psychedelics in general and LSD in particular function as nonspecific amplifiers and catalysts of consciousness they don't give you a particular experience they don't what they do is hyper amplify your consciousness and if you use these hyper these hours of hyper amplified consciousness carefully and conscientiously if you shut out all outside stimulus and focus your attention completely from within you can use those hours to explore and to in a sense excavate the deep architecture of the psyche now how to put this there are many different ways of using these psycho technologies you can use them in low doses to gradually peel away the layers of your personal unconscious you can use them in high doses to sort of break through those layers and plunge yourself deep into the nature of consciousness itself I should say that when I was doing this work just to be clear I was always working privately I was always working in very controlled circumstances either at my house or at my wife's office my sitter for all the years of my work was my wife my first wife who is a clinical psychologist so I was always protected from the world I was isolated I was lying down I was surrounded by pillows I was wearing headphones listening to a very carefully curated playlist of music which is designed to facilitate a deepening of the experience in wearing eye shades so I was completely protected someone was taking care of my body taking care of the musical selection my job was simply to focus on what was emerging at the center of my experience and to allow that experience to go wherever it would go if you do that what begins to happen in the early stages as you begin to confront your personal shadow you begin to front confront all those aspects of your life which you are ashamed of or embarrassed by are intimidated by are uncertain about the deepest fears of your life including when you get down to it the the fear of death the fear of extinction the fear of the meaninglessness of life and then as you if you keep that process these fears kind of come to a crescendo a peak expression and if you will can confront that peak expression and let it take you where it wants to take you it will take you through some crisis which eventually become some form of death and rebirth some absolute shattering of your life as you had known it of reality had us you had known it and then you fall into a deeper level of reality you die at one level and awaken within a deeper level of reality and your session shifts from purification to an ecstatic phase of the session and you basically are given you enter into an intimate dialogue with the universe and enter an intimate initiation into successive layers of the universe this is what working critically therapeutically with psychedelics is all about and would you describe that crisis what Jung would turn the collective unconscious well the collective unconscious is a stratum of consciousness that lies below the personal unconscious so in Jung's model every first encounter when we go below our conscious mind we encounter our unconscious mind our personal unconscious but if you can go deeper than your personal unconscious you enter into a stream of awareness which seems to be a collective stream shared by all human beings of your species so this is Jung's collective psyche right and if you go deeper than that you enter into still deeper streams of consciousness entering into what some would call global consciousness but you can enter into levels of consciousness that go beyond space-time reality altogether enter into archetypal levels of consciousness enter into complete states of dissolving into non duality in what might be called causal oneness and you can enter deeper states of consciousness even than that so it's it's a long journey with many levels of exploration along the way so in in your view like the view of Jung and in many spiritual texts and many religious texts that we have our personal individual mind but the universe itself is a mind of oneness of its own it would that be correct yes and are as I experience it at least our individual mind is a fractal embodiment of fractal manifestation of this larger cosmic mind so at one level there is a functional duality which we might think call it small mind and the big mind but at a deeper level there really isn't a duality there is a continuum of awareness that we are a small actualization of fractal manifestation of this larger cosmic consciousness now just while we're discussing about your technique and and what you were or what you're up to in these sessions one of our questions from from from from the Terence Mckenna guys was about the music you were listening to so you describe the area where you were and that Carrollton your lovely wife was ex-wife currently was sitting for you but what what about the music you were listening to the I know this changed over time but could you tell us a bit about that well here I was drawing upon Helen Bonnie's work early work in the study of the stages of psychic psychological opening and it's like in an LSD session I learned about her work through Stan Groff's work and she differentiate five stages of opening and closing in an LSD session LSD session is a long session it's you know it's a six to eight hour session and there is the early stages of latency then the the medicine begins to kick in then there is an acceleration of an opening of consciousness one begins to encounter resistances and fears as one moves deeper the the energy continues to build exponentially there is a peak period and then there is you hit the long kind of steady plateau of the experience and then there is a long slow gradual return so each of those stages of consciousness are best paired with particular types of music in their early stages you want music to calm you and relax you before the session actually gets underway and then when the session begins you want music that gives you a sense of flow and continuity music that can support your support your letting go of your fears and resistances shifting gradually to stronger music with more climactic Cadence's and themes to support you really letting go into the deeper turmoil that rises in your consciousness eventually leading to the moments of great breakthrough and then as you move into the breakthrough you want music that supports the vast expanse and the opening of horizons that can open after you go through a death rebirth process and in the return you want music which is very gentle increasingly gentle gives you a lot of space in which to process your experiences now again I want to mention that all of this is contingent on the type of psychedelic you're using and the dose at which you're working with now I chose to work with very high doses of LSD I worked with 500 to 600 micrograms I started working I did three sessions with about 200 micrograms chose to work at five to six hundred micrograms in a sustained protocol of this sort and this generates enormous ly powerful experiences I mean the process of your consciousness it's not like taking a hundred and 50 micrograms and relaxing on a Sunday after Sun a sunny afternoon under the trees it's it's a much more powerful hyperstimulation of your consciousness that just challenges and shatters all the limitations of your known mind and the music accordingly is I found it I was important to have very strong music engaging music I found quickly that indigenous chanting and music from foreign cultures was more effective for me than classical music it's very foreign nature made it easier for me to surrender to the foreign territory that I was entering into it gave me gave my ego less room for anything to hold on to and therefore it was more challenging but it was more productive in that it helped me get into the deep material more quickly more easily right and the indigenous music you are using were these kind of ayahuasca shaman chance or were they for they were from worldwide different different tribal chants what invitation I have used the scales from ayahuasca ceremonies late in in my psychedelic life mostly after my LSD years I mean I did this work between 1979 and 1999 between when I was 30 and 50 I'm 70 now but in the primary years I I didn't really encounter the ayahuasca music until much later in this process the music tended to come from a lot of African music a lot of Tibetan music Indonesian music Japanese music South American music I basically just was always looking for music that would give me a supportive but challenging context against which I would allow myself to enter into these deep States and I found that I could only use a piece of music approximately about about three times after I'd used it three times the music became encoded with the experiences that I have had with the music and in order to allow to avoid being kind of repetitiously encoded or programmed by the music I always had to be looking and using fresh music right okay so the mind had taken the music and you kind of knew it and it was it was then program along with the previous experience so yes if you re listening to it you would go back to the same experience or well it would tend to pull you in that direction or at least there was potential for it to pull you in that direction maybe not the second time you listened to it but if you listen to the music repetitively repeatedly it can it can narrow your conscious experience instead of expanding and opening it right so as you just touched on there as well you you saw this or what you came to learn that what you were doing was a series of iterated deaths and rebirths in one body which is also quite in the other literature with Stan graphs work and whatnot so could you talk a little bit about how you view that and what is it relationship to actual death and rebirth as we know it the leaving of this form and coming back into a new form perhaps your views on that yes well it took me a long time to understand the patterns of my sessions because in some ways they started as I expected them drawing upon Stan's map of consciousness that he gave us in his early writings but then after a few years they seemed to diverge in some ways and enter into new territory but one of the things that I've come to understand over time is that consciousness as many levels many tiers operational levels and the only way to and when you enter each time you enter into a new level of consciousness there is required a surrender of everything you had known before everything you had learned and assumed before in order to enter into a level of consciousness that operates by completely different rules now it's it's not that Chris Bosh's ego even a softened ego can be catapulted out in some reality and have an experience it's more that the reality of Chris Bosh or the atom of Chris Page is dissolved and you dissolve into encompass encompassing fields of consciousness itself and when one enters a new field of conscience the only way to learn in these conditions is through initiation you learn by becoming the reality that you were being initiated into so the early transition going through what stan calls the perinatal level of consciousness the confrontation with death often reliving birth going through repeated cycles of death and rebirth around literally physical thought of an apparent physical dying but also reliving the moment of birth and it's that our physical existence is bound by birth and death we get here by being born we'd leave here by dying and therefore if our consciousness is going to transcend the limits of our physical existence we must in a sense come to terms with our it's often we transcend the limits of time-space consciousness in an acute reliving of how we got here and an anticipation of our final separation from time-space consciousness so there is a a sense in which you truly do die psychologically before you die physically and it can be such an intense psychological death that you can confuse that with physical death and you can think you are actually dying and there's a sense in which you are but you're dying psychologically psycho spiritually rather than physically then you transition to a deeper level of reality you enter spiritual reality which operates by different rules than physical reality but in the early years often you at least also speak for myself I my experience of this reality was still colored by my experience of time and space so the assumptions of time and space kind of placed limits on your experience of that spiritual level of reality and there comes a time if you keep pushing that eventually there is an invitation extended or a breakthrough which you come to where you have to let go even deeper let go to something even deeper than your physical identity which shatters you yet again and takes you into yet another level of reality which is deeper a deeper level of spiritual reality than the earlier level you had been experiencing and this process repeats itself multiple times if you if you use your sessions in a focused way and always pushing to explore the deepest dimension of consciousness it's possible now I want to say I don't advise that people do what I did I mean really I if I were doing it over again I would not adopt such an aggressive strategy as I as I adopted always pushing so hard with such high levels of velocity I would be much gentler on myself I would balance high dose sessions with low dose sessions I would balance working with LSD which is a kind of a high ceiling psychedelic with psilocybin or ayahuasca which are much more body grounded psychedelics so I'm describing something without recommending it to be followed or be used by other people truly I don't but doing what I did and learning how to navigate these waters and surviving my own foolishness I'm just in the book I'm just trying to tell stage by stage exactly what happened as best I could on this deepening immersion into the universe and when you say pushing forward that suggests the kind of active an active role in the in the experience was it was it a process of pushing outward into these kind of further landscapes these further psychedelics and psychological vistas always it a process of surrendering into them or maybe a combination of the two it's really a matter of surrendering the only pushing is by the repeating of the circumstances of availability you you create a completely quiet and safe container you detach yourself from all the circumstances of your daily life you take a powerful medicine you surrender the yourself to the care of another and then you open you allow yourself to open what happens next is beyond your control at least working with this substance at this higher dose is beyond your control you surrender to a larger consciousness and and I've longer I work with this I this material the more became clear that there was a larger consciousness that was guiding my sessions guiding my education in the sessions that was meeting me breaking me down loving me caressing me breaking me down some more forcing me to face certain things challenging me to face certain things and then thrilling me taking me into deeper and deeper intimacy with what I would come to describe as the creative intelligence of the universe the the cut it's hard to describe when you enter so deeply into states of consciousness that's so far transcend your physical consciousness how do you describe it what what categories do you have to describe it we could call it the cosmic mind the universe's mind the great expanse in my in my heart of hearts I've came to call it my beloved because returning to such intimacy with the very source of your existence with the source of all existence awakened such a deep passion of embrace and being embraced that it well I call it my beloved yes and I mean what I really love about your work it for me and and somewhat Stan gross work is it reconciles psychology psychedelics religion and spirituality in a way can be read in a way that reconciles that when you discuss terminology and you discuss it as your beloved Jesus may have called that the kingdom of heaven within Buddha may have called that dharmakaya the Hindu Atman and so there exist kind of a spiritual terminology that to a lot of people is very alien and dogmatic and separate but once viewed in the context of your work through through the psychedelic where one can experience this as a direct contact with the trans person or the the transcendent it all fits very very nicely and you all of a sudden become to understand what those human beings were trying to describe it's not something abstract it's something that can be experienced in a number of ways would you agree yes it can and certainly once these experiences become part of our cultural story they are subject to all the distortions that culture can bring so they can be subject to the distortions of historically limited perspectives to patriarchy to all sorts of cultural constrictions but I had the advantage of I was teaching world religions and I was teaching courses in comparative mysticism and so over and over again year after year I was studying some of the great spiritual teachers from around the planet and if you do this you very quickly outgrow the limitations of your own religion of birth and you begin to enter into this collective perspective where you begin to recognize a deeper fundamental core overlap of many of the teachings of the different great religious teachers what what is often called the perennial philosophy the the perennial tradition and at the same time so there is a sense which recognizing what people have been talking about when they when they talk about the divine what they talk about when they talk about transcendence or atman and brahman these categories become alive for you as has an essential vocabulary to articulate what is becoming your natural experience of the world and at the same time at least in my experience pushing as deeply into the universe as I did I was shown over and over again that all the religions of the last four or five thousand years are radically and profoundly incomplete they are Noble initiatives in history which reflect a certain state of human evolution but the landscape of human evolution the landscape of the divine initiative and I even hesitate I don't talk about God very much and I hesitate to even talk about the divine because those words are so heavily laden with theological presuppositions that I don't necessarily want to affirm or buy into but basically when you when you begin to experience the magnitude of the intelligence that suffuses existence and the magnitude of the compassion and an intimate love that the creative impetus the creative intelligence has for all of its manifestation all of its manifest beings it just it it just opens worlds within worlds within worlds so there is a both an affirming and a humble recognition of the greatness of the great teachers and saints of history and at the same time a sense that even they even they have not captured perhaps the vastness of the great expanse of the world of the world as it is the world of you know our 13.7 billion year old world and the scale of the evolutionary project you know Sri Aurobindo said that humanity was a transitional being and if we don't understand what we're transitioning to it's hard to understand what we are even right now everything we're doing is taking us it's not we're not only the culmination of everything that has been in our evolutionary story but we're also laying foundations for what we are in the process of becoming and what we're becoming is something at least from my experience is not something that results in a culmination of a few thousand years out but hundreds of thousands millions of years billions of years coming so it's just that radical expansion of existential horizons that that qualifies my relationship to the world's religions and your journey in particular I mean what what I really enjoyed in the book as well was your journey hasn't necessarily been one of just love and light and bliss and divine unfolding as many have the kind of presupposition of the spiritual path to do use the lack of a better word the spiritual path they think is some kind of love and light a blissful path but actually it can be very difficult very isolating very lonely and and very nightmarish in some some sense many people that are on on the path whether it be through psychedelics or whatever spiritual spiritual practices they may be involved in to be on that individual path can be very difficult and what you mentioned in your book was some of the dark side of what you've been through very openly and honestly voyaging especially in the in your early sessions through the hell realms and and in your sessions 11 to 15 you mentioned the hell realms I mean could you could you talk about those a little bit yeah I had I had to think a lot about how to present the different types of suffering and the different types of challenges that I faced on the journey because and in fact it was my greatest concern in beginning to share my story my journey with the world with others because I did not want them to become scared of the unseen universe and I did not want them to prematurely misjudge the psychedelic method itself and I really had to to think about this and eventually I decided just to tell to tell what happened to lay it out and to tell what happened and there is great joy and and great beauty and great ecstasy and just I mean I wouldn't trade these 73 days for any treasures on earth I mean they just they showed me so much and they gave me so much that whatever purification processes I went through and whatever pains I went through I paid them gladly to have been and had been rewarded more than fairly for what happened along the way but the what you mentioned the hell realms well this is the kind of scenario I basically after about two years of work I went through a really crushing ego death where my my historical existence was just turned inside out and shattered and I thought okay I've gone through ego death then I won't have to go through that anymore I won't have to go through ego death everything's going to get better and better now but what happened was that very quickly within a couple of sessions I began to enter into realms of collective suffering that were just much much worse than anything I went through an ego death I entered into what Buddhism calls the hell realms I called it an ocean of suffering I was systematically over two year period and I was taken deeper and deeper and broken down at deeper and deeper levels into realms of collective anguish involving thousands and thousands and thousands of beings human beings and thousands of years of history and very detailed patterns of configuration and at first I thought this must be a deeper iteration of ego death I must be going through a deeper form of ego death but eventually by the time this ended I realized that this wasn't about my personal ego death it wasn't about personal healing at all that somehow the universe or something was using my sessions to facilitate a healing of my species of my people that in somehow in opening myself or allowing into my conscious awareness the unresolved trauma of history all the terrible things we've done to each other all the killings and maimings and rapes and just that gave terrible scars and the collective psyche that somehow when a person opens this deeply if you are willing to let this pain and suffering in it has a clarifying effect a healing effect a transformational effect that heals a certain portion of the collective psyche of humanity now I wouldn't dare try to estimate how large a portion or what its impact is but I was has taken repeatedly through these hell realms into these hell realms and eventually they culminated I was about four unifor and a half years in 24 sessions in and there they culminated an extraordinary kind of orgy of the ocean of suffering and then I was spun out into a deeper level of reality that laid beyond the hill realms into archetypal reality and at that point all the collective suffering stopped just as the ego death suffering stopped when I went through ego death the ocean of suffering stopped when I went through this culmination and entered into archetypal reality but later at deeper levels as I went into still deeper levels there were still challenging periods that I would go through just periods where I entered into patterns of chaos patterns of psychological dismemberment patterns of just different subtle subtle forms or ordeals there were hard to understand because you know we're charting some territory that lies far far deep into the into the collective fabric of things into the not the collective fabric this is beyond the collective fabric into into the dimensions of the divine into the dimensions of the cosmic mind itself but every time I came into one of these sort of patterns of our deal our patterns of clarification I came to recognize that these were all some form of purification that if I allowed these things to take place something was being lifted from my system something was being broken open and eventually it would culminate and take me into yet a new stunning level of discovery and a deeper intimacy with the body of the divine I mean many many people at these points were they're going into an ocean of suffering and in your book describes also your experiences were sometimes violent and vomiting and many people would say well that's enough of that you know I'm gonna understand I'm gonna start what what was it that drove you forward in particular into this I mean what was that drive to because it could have hypothetically been that they would never end he would just continually you didn't know what was was over the horizon I guess or did you Intuit that I didn't know what was in the horizon over the horizon but it is something that I the perhaps the most profound gift that Stan Grof gave me was a trust in the universe they trust that you could surrender yourself to whatever was asked of you and if you did so completely the your the universe would in the end it would take care of you you would go through our deals that you may not understand but in the end you would understand that you would get large enough and enter deeply enough into the universe that with hindsight you would get a deeper understanding of what was going on but absolute trust if you surrender completely it will lead to breakthrough it will leave to a deepening initiation so and I think you know everybody has different measures of tolerance and different circumstances and again I don't think it's wise to push even though I did this as responsibly as I could and and really taking very good care of my body throughout and in between my sessions I was doing about five sessions a year I worked for four years I stopped for six years and then I worked for ten very intense years so over the 14 years or 14 and a half years when I was actively working I was averaging about five sessions a year so I had months in between every session to digest my experiences to write them down to think about them to reflect upon them and I was doing a lot of yoga in between I was doing a lot of meditation a lot of spiritual practice but even doing all of those preparatory practices I found myself pushed to my absolute limits in going as deeply as I did and ironically in the end it wasn't the pain that was the most difficult thing to manage in my work it was the ecstasy it was the intimacy with the fabric of existence it was entering into what I came to call the diamond luminosity what Buddhism calls dharmakaya the absolute the the clear light of absolute reality entering into dissolving into the light that precedes the physical universes manifestation dissolving into the crystalline body of the divine that ecstasy that joy became more difficult to manage than the pain of getting there and the reason it became difficult to manage was not because of the joy itself but because it was a temporary condition I could not stay in that condition now there are great masters and great beings who can stay in that condition and all honor always to the great ones but in my condition in my circumstance I could only gain temporary access to these realities and when I would come back out of them I was simultaneously deeply and profoundly spiritually satisfied and gratified and I was left with an aching sense of bereavement because I could not stay I had to leave yeah I'm it reminds me a little bit of what Baba Ramdass used to talk about he used to say we're all walking each other home and a little bit about what you're you're talking about it it one necessarily doesn't require psychedelics in order to to go to this place there are people that seem to be able to do it without the use of these tools and life itself is an analogy for what you're talking about we go through on a day-to-day basis forms of suffering which we tolerate and overcome for the good of ourselves and the community in the society in the human race and we are periods periods of bliss so we are interfacing with our reality on a day-to-day level independently of these kind of cosmic experiences would you agree that's the case we're all walking together I mean yes absolutely absolutely I mean it once again what happens in these sessions is that your consciousness is temporarily amplified that's all your consciousness is tearily temporarily amplified so if you want to understand what truly happens in a session you must have an understanding of base what happened what's happening in life outside of a session so in that context my understanding of life which I I draw from my philosophical studies and psychological studies and then in addition to that my psychedelic experiences for me reincarnation is a simple fact of life it's just this is how life works we incarnate there's a narrowing of our conscious experience with an incarnation we take on a particular persona male/female rich-poor where we we incarnate and the particular historical period social conditions we live our life as best as we can and then we die we expand back into our deeper soul consciousness back into spiritual reality when we die our consciousness expands we return to the light when we incarnate there is a contraction into the specificity of our next learning exercise different gender different social circumstance different historical period we live and learn and then we expand because I'm an academic I tend to see this as like a semester you know we choose our courses for the semester and then we're locked in then at the end of the semester we get some breathing space expand so we keep this up and we're always kind of we're in the dance of learning to create learning the consequences of our choices making good choices making bad choices you know just learning and growing and becoming more and this is the dance of life this is taking place and it's been taking place for hundreds of thousands of years when we begin to meditate without psychedelics just we would begin to meditate and focus on the consciousness which is living through all of these lives one of the things that happens is we speed up what is taking place when reincarnation if you want to speed up your spiritual evolution then focus on the fundamental inner experience of your being and if you do that you begin to confront themes and issues and choices which if you didn't do that would eventually manifest in some conditions in the outer physical world but if you don't want to wait for them to manifest in the outer physical world you can confront those conditions in your inner psychological world so use you actually you speed up your evolutionary process when you focus in your your inner being and in the thought of the inner flow of your being and psychedelics is simply another form of spiritual practice which very intensely for temporary periods of time focuses on that fundamental core stream of your being and so there is a detoxification process an accelerating process that takes you eventually deeper and deeper home I mean deeper and deeper there are just so many levels of home so many levels of return but yes this is simply we are simply dancing the dance of life just doing it in a slightly different form and you can stop anywhere along the way in just as you can stop your meditation practice you can stop your psychedelic practice and you continue to dance the dance in life it is the dance I mean we touched upon this briefly in a in a private conversation but we discussed the idea of moving outward from the kind of collective egoic mind what a cart all would call the collective egoic mind and moving into a process of what Jung would a process of individuation becoming an individual and that that process can be a very lonely process too if you if you're not within the community they understand you like like Jung said loneliness is not not not from her comes from having nobody around it comes from not being able to express the ideas that are important to you or that others find it invisible this this idea the the the journey of individuation can be a lonely one and the road to that as you're discussing it now is this process of evolution and meditation and I'm sure you've been through experiences like many of our listeners and people that are on these journeys I'm sure you've been through those experiences you know through this book and through your life would that be correct and saying yes and I think basically the deeper I have gone into this on the one hand I like I feel more deeply my fundamental common ground with all human beings I don't feel unique or separated or set aside in any way I more and more deeply with the human condition and with the dance that human beings are dancing across the globe around the world and you know in in many spiritual traditions if we address this issue of individuality in my book dark Natalie dawn the last chapter of that book in which I am discussing there a number of things but one of the things I'm discussing is my own psychedelic history in the last chapter the Phaeton the name of that chapter is the fate of individuality because many spiritual traditions basically say the individual is an is an illusion individuality is basically a it's just an illusion and the goal is to transcend individuality and return to the one and you the drop returns to the ocean Vedanta thought in India basically that the drop returns to the ocean you dissolve into the divine and that is coming home and and any kind of holding on to any kind of sense of separate existence and individuality is basically it's it's not a fully mature spiritual understanding or experience and I disagree with that my experience has been that individuality is one of the great gifts of creation individuality is one of the great manifestations of existence and what we don't want to do is live in an isolated individuality to think that somehow our individuality makes us separate ontologically in with respect to the core of our being separate from other beings in the world unique in the world or that our individuality is a permanent abiding individuality which never changes I mean basically I agree with Buddhism in their teaching of anata or no self or emptiness of self that there is no private self in the sense of a of a separate self that all our experience is part of the matrix of cause and effect manifesting in a continual arising and falling away and there is no unchanging self there is no absolute unchanging self over time but if you can let go of that small sense of self that ego which sees itself separate and unchanging and open it and grow into a deeper experience of individuality which is in continuous exchange with all living beings and in continual expansion and growing and development and I think that basically the maturation of that individuality over time the maturing of that selfless kind of individuality is one of the great spiritual gifts of our time-space experience so the two truths one is the truth of wholeness the truth of oneness the truth of interconnectedness of interpenetration another truth is the truth of the learning system which experiences all these things learns from it internalizes it and becomes more because of it which which is also one of the things that I grappled with with in your book and wasn't quite sure about was are we talking about we have one soul which is known as God or to many people is linguistic reductionist terminology that we have to kind of use is God or the divine more our think about many individual souls which is it or is it both well we can choose to use language any way we want we can we can define our terms as we go as long as we're careful and we know what we're doing so one can talk about God as the one soul of which we are all drops within that one ocean of soul and that's perfectly fine we can also use the term soul to refer to the accumulated experience of all of my former lives integrated in a unique individual consciousness which is as unique as a fingerprint within a still larger matrix of the collective species mind and a larger matrix within the planetary mind and within a larger matrix of the galactic mind but a true individual an individuality with Jay merges so we can determine new we can use the word soul any way we want as long as we're clear what we're doing with it in my experience about halfway through my journey in session 38 as a session I discuss in the chapter on the benediction of blessings I had a very interesting experience previously 11 years previously I had the experience when I was coming through the ocean of suffering I had a series of sessions which repeatedly took me back into the same experience taking me deeper and deeper into it which was experiencing the totality of my life from birth to death as simultaneously present as a completed whole it was it was like looking down my life from beginning to end and seeing it and experiencing it as a totality complete and finished with on within itself which was a mines shattering experience and it and I discuss it in the in the chapter deep time in the soul but 11 years later I was given I was a very deeper stage of the work I was working at Khalsa level reality a little reality of oneness and in this time I had the experience of seemingly integrating all of my former lives they were coming in quite quickly from different centuries different periods and it was like wrapping a filament of white light around a kite spool just wrapping these lies were coming in and were wrapping themselves around this kite spool and at one point they hit critical mass they fused and when they fuse there was an explosion of diamond light from within my chest and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness that was unlike any I had experienced before I was an individual but beyond any category or any experience of individuality that I had ever known before and I came to language this in terms of the birth of the diamond soul and he gave me I was given a series of teachings in this session that all focused upon reframing my understanding of what the goal of reincarnation is about because much of our teaching of reincarnation comes from cultures and times in history where the pattern of the teaching seems to be we are mired in illusion we grow slowly slowly through multiple incarnations eventually we come to a discovery of our essential divine nature we awaken to our divine nature and when we achieve that awakening breakthrough we leave time space in Hinduism the earliest term for reincarnation was moksha escape we escaped time and space we escaped ego but I think all of the and the same thing we have all of the car mala G's of the religions of the last 4,000 years or so are all up and out cosmologies we achieve salvation we achieve spiritual realization and we believe we we achieve nirvana and when we die we move into parinirvana final Nirvana or Nirvana without the body they basically spiritual realization culminates in some off-planet heavenly paradise whether it's the heaven or the garden or some off planet paradise and I think basically that is a fundamentally incomplete cosmology I think it represents a certain stage of our human development but it's not the end of the story and I think in this experience what I was being shown is that eventually in this long long process of expanding and contracting being dying and being born dying and being born learning more learning more over time over time sooner or later sooner or later the soul which usually we experience and by soul I don't I mean the totality of all of our experiences in all of our former lives sooner or later the soul wakes up inside the body the soul wakes up inside time and space that's what I'm calling the birth of the demon soul it is to be spiritual it is a spiritually waking up a spiritual maturing a psychological maturing where we know that we are much much more than our bodies is achill experience we know we are more than everything weeks have experienced during the years since our physical birth we are no longer attempted to identify strictly with the limits of this particular body we have an intuitive recognition of the breath of all of our relationships with human beings that we have been developing relationships with for thousands of years and there is a transparency not only to other people or to other species but a transparency to the universe itself so that we can we can rest we can absorb we can commune more deeply with the the divine say in while we are inside time and space that's the birth of the diamond soul this is this represents I think the next stage of our human evolution which is a spiritual maturation it's it's heaven on earth it truly is heaven on earth so what you mean is the the spiritual realm as we know it kind of perceived that is the dream world for those without experience with the tools the the dream world doesn't exist in in matter it's it's outside of mat and that is the source of creativity it's the source of what some people term God the source of the divine and that is manifesting in matter but you're talking about the divine the collective manifesting in matter within the universe is that correct yes basically we can think of it perhaps like the mother universe and the daughter universe the mother universe is spiritual reality which is continually infusing and orchestrating and shaping and receiving physical reality so there is at the very quantum level this dance that takes place at the subatomic level we're learning that there is a continual infusion of energy into time and space coming from this quantum or sub quantum realm it no 96% of the universe is dark energy dark matter that that physical existence is just the surface of things yes with reincarnation we learned that our our egoic identity is not our final identity it's only a temporary identity there is a deeper identity that is emerging over long stretches of historical time there's a soul identity so there is I think there's just a lot of larger sense of the of the architecture of the universe is a larger sense of the landscape that we are how to we are standing always astride two realities we have one foot in the daughter universe one foot in the mother universe and the more we can make this a conscious you know integration the more we begin to [Music] consciously live as the expression of the inflowing of this mother spiritual energy into the divine energy of manifestation so I tend to image this very simplistic leus one reality is light and the other reality is green the manifest universe the green universe the physical world is a is the manifest body of the divine the world of pure light the world of pure spirit is the other side of the divine the transcendent divine we live the foot in both of those realities most of the time I guess we tend to get caught in just the physical side of reality and so we tend to long for the spiritual dimension but I think as we awaken more completely and more deeply we realize it's not simply a matter of awakening and leaving time and space as if something's wrong with time and space but awakening more completely to the fruition of the evolutionary project inside time and space so that can we become more conscious creators and collaborators in creation inside time and space it doesn't deny the joys of heaven it doesn't deny the joys of transcendent reality but it is it leads to a new cosmology it needs leads to a deeper understanding of what the purpose and project of physical existence is and we didn't one of the questions that came from one of the talents McKenna groups from one of the members there was its it nicely slotted in here I guess would be that during your experiences did you meet any entities any entities that existed in a non atomic realm in in the quantum realm any any entities there that were not human souls every week we can read about that in Rick Strassman work the spirit molecule and some some of the work he's done was there anything there for you that was foreign from there was not the collective that was not not this one soul or was it all a oneness well it's interesting I have had experiences where I have met discrete intelligences discrete entities in spiritual reality but on the whole that has not been the flavor or the trajectory of my experience and again this is partly to do with the substances and partly to do with how we work with the substances the entities seem to be particularly prominent in experiences that involve DMT or some of the variations of DMT ayahuasca or five Meo DMT sometimes her straight DMT my experience again used LSD somewhat different I kept being dissolved into deeper levels of spiritual reality and it was as if I was being dissolved not into a society of beings though I did meet beings in different forms but at a different at a deeper level I was being dissolved into deeper levels of being itself it's it really was like being dissolved from atomic reality leaving atomic reality to entering into quantum reality into fields of awareness and and and larger pattern of awareness so at every level there are patterns which one could qualen could categorize as entities but if you really sit with each of those entities in deep forms they eventually dissolve themselves into yet still deeper patterns within existence itself so on the one hand I do I'm really comfortable with the entities and I see the wonderful art produced by the great ayahuasca artists Pablo Ringo and just the it's a universe filled with entities and spiritual presences and I'm really comfortable with that that does resonate with my experience but my deeper experience has been to be dissolved into deeper and deeper patterns of being rather than separate beings so just moving then on as we look to the future I mean we just touched upon that a little bit but what what inclinations you've had according to the book and what you've just mentioned there is you've seen will you think this process is going and how this ties in with the human journey not only now and and the passive would disgust but but where it's going into the future I mean could you talk about your insights there and how you think this is unfolding at the moment particularly now under under these circumstances of kovat lockdown and whatnot which officers are to something much larger much larger yeah yeah this is one of the largest surprises for me in this work and I'm really cautious about entering into it and yet I in discussion even though I also believe it's perhaps the most important body of visionary experience that emerged in my work because and I'd say it was surprising because in the early years of my work I saw doing this work and terms I had a model of individual transformation either individual healing or individual enlightenment I was doing this work to improve myself in some way or shape or form but what happened was of course in entering the ocean of suffering it all became about collective transformation it all became about healing the collective and about releasing the pains that have been accumulated in history in the collective psyche and then I was moved into deeper levels and about that time in that transition a series of visions began and these visions were consistent from the 23rd session all the way to the 70th session it wasn't that they were there every session but they were periodically I was being initiated into a particular understanding of history a particular understanding of human history and repeatedly there was a sense that humanity was coming into a period of decisive significance a period of profound break through a spiritual culmination a culmination of our entire reincarnation history that we this was going to be a before-and-after moment this was one of the ways it was envisioned was I was climbing up this mountain and on the other side of the mountain I was in sort of shadows but on the other side of the mountain there was this brilliant light of brilliant Valley with just brilliant light and that humanity was coming into the fundamental turning point and this went on for years this vision of it and I eventually wrote these down I collected them and I called them the visions of awakening but I did not see I had not seen how life was ever going to carry humanity across the threshold because when I looked at the world around me I saw as much evidence for our being stupid and making just terrible choices as I did for us making spiritually wise choices I did not see us letting go of our collective greed I did not see us taking more and more responsibility for the well-being of others some were of course but many weren't and then in 1995 and 55 sessions into the journey the universe took me deeply into deep into the future deeper into deep time than it had ever taken me before and it took me into an experience which I experienced not as an individual even a spiritual individual but I experienced it and I know this sounds outrageous but I experienced it as the species I was dissolved into the collective psyche so deeply that for these hours I was our species mind I was dissolved into the collective psyche and in that context I experienced a building crisis a mounting crisis that just was taking away stripping us of reality as we had known it it was it was the dark night of our collective soul it was a time in history where a real confrontation with the consequences of choices that we've been making historically a real confrontation with our poor choices we were losing control we were we were just being shattered it really reached a point where I thought it was an extinction event I thought we were all going to die it was like being on a small island when a hurricane comes along it comes upon it that it just was wiping out all life on the island and just when it was at its peak just when it was it seemed that death was inevitable the storm passed and there were survivors many had been killed but there were survivors and when the survivors started to pick themselves up and started to gather and find each other and reconstitute life there was springing forward ringing from within us the most extraordinary phenomenon there was this birth of new insights a birth of new values new understanding new priorities new social initiatives they were basically an unleashing of something that we had learned something that had taken place in the center of the human heart in the midst of this crisis basically just as a saint in undergoing intense spiritual practice goes through the purification which jonatha costs cross calls the dark night of the soul likewise in our collective evolution the dark night of our collective soul a time of complete surrender and intense purification which breaks us down at the center yielded to a time of great awakening a great spiritual manifestation a great redirection of the human heart and of human culture it was a true great awakening of the species and in time in subsequent sessions I was taken into the deep time again and I began to be shown that this represented not simply a historical breakthrough and not simply a technical or economic restructuring of our culture but it was a truly seismic shift in the depths of the collective psyche a pivot took place in this global crisis a global systems crisis which appeared to be driven by a global ecological crisis it was a shift in the core psyche the collective psyche which all other human beings draw from on their individual life so when the collective psyche shifted it meant that every generation that was born on the planet after the shift took place they were being informed by and were infused by the new blueprint this new psychological blueprint this new capacity and I think what I was experiencing was a true spiritual awakening out of just individuals but of our entire species and this was deepening deepened in the years that followed so ever since this time I have come to understand that my personal belief in the visionary experiences that were given to me in the sessions were showing that Humanity is coming to a decisive moment in its evolutionary journey we were coming into a time of critical challenge and a time requiring maximum effort and maximum clarity we are literally this is a time of labor gestation is long the period of gestation is a long time but the time of labor is short and intense and convulsive we have been preparing for this time in history for thousands and thousands of years through reincarnation reincarnation reincarnation but now we have entered into a time I think in which we are giving birth to the future human we are giving birth to a different kind of human being and I think we are giving birth to the diamond soul I think the soul is going is entering into history in a collectively unmanifested nted fashion I think the world as we know it was designed by ego and the ego is a magnificent and beautiful psychological structure I mean I really I respected enormous Lee but ultimately the ego is a fragmented psychological structure and with it leaves us cut off from each other and from existence itself the world designed by the ego creates categories of problems of division which we know and recognize well in history now dividing between races dividing between religions dividing between classes just division division division but the birth of the diamond Sol represents a new starting point human for Humanity a deeper and I think the core of it is this a deep experience of oneness not just as a concept or as a category but a profound awakening of oneness within the human heart and the world that is a species which is grounded in this experience of oneness builds a different world than the ego bills and I think the diamond sold is we are giving birth to the diamond Sol in history and I see the Cova 19 not at this crisis but perhaps as an early stage of this fermenting crisis it is a crisis which is very painful and very difficult but it's teaching us something if we learn the lessons that kovat 19 is health opportunity to teach us if we learn about well here everybody would put their own fill-in-the-blanks at this point what it is trying to teach us but if we learn the lessons of compassion if we learn how bad things go when we give ourselves over to egoic leadership and divisive patterns of leadership and self-centeredness within the species then things go very badly but if we open into other caring if we open into selflessness if we open into reining in some of the patterns of blind repetition and greed then we are learning things which will be very valuable to us when the deeper crises that are coming manifest and all you have to do is is just read the works of the deeply informed ecologist and environmental students of history to appreciate the the scale of what we are coming into as we increasingly heat the planet and and whether that the tragedies that are going to be generated that are being generated by our changing climate this I think is really the the crisis the deeper crisis that kovat 19 is giving us an opportunity to prepare for yeah not beautiful it's it's in the collective mind as well I think that we're all on an individual level aware that something is brewing or something is coming and I don't know if that's how it's been throughout history of the humanity that we've always felt there's some kind of cataclysmic event on the horizon but now more than ever it's certainly in in the collective mind and our habits our nature our way of being at this moment is is both destructive but we're also seeing this kind of psychedelic Renaissance and we're also seeing a lot of people looking to the Past for answers about the future more than ever and I think in the past two years then in say in the past 20 but yeah it's mm-hmm it's a big part of of your vision but you say that the co wait what do you think is the co but is only a small part of that but as you look to the future do you see a very like Maeve throughout evolution previous species have had to die off in order for new versions of ourselves to evolve yeah do you see like a catastrophe a world ending catastrophes that what you're you're pointing to well I want to be careful I'm not a visionary outside of my psychedelic work yes I don't I don't have a psychic ability to see into the future and when I only have what I saw and what I was shown in my visionary experiences inside my psychedelic sessions these have been consistent in uniform I trust the consciousness that that gave me these visions they seem to be deliberate and well-crafted so I trust them but I recognize that one person's it visions are only one person's visions and they don't necessarily hold the same value to other people so what I saw was a world coming into acute crisis a depth of crisis that was literally breaking us down at very deep and fundamental levels and it was only when we when we had reached intolerable amounts of suffering that we were willing to start making choices that we were not willing to contemplate previously and in making these new choices choices for the greater good choices for our children's children's children choices that were necessary in order to pull ourselves back from this destructive binge that we had been on for the last several hundred years then a new future began to emerge but I was not given specifics about how when or why I wasn't told when I wasn't told why it was just very very broad strokes but what I was given was the inner experience of this death and rebirth as a species and I was given some understanding of the collective mechanisms see we have we have to travel a great distance in a very short period of time how can we really mature to the driest of the level to the challenges that we are facing as fast as we need to in order to survive what we are letting loose on the globe and I was given some insights into mechanisms that are operating at the collective level I won't go into these in detail because they laid out in the book but it has to do with how systems operate when they move into nonlinear into nonlinear ranges non-equilibrium system some of the physics of non-equilibrium systems as they apply to psychic fields and the psychic field of the human family as a totality you know so to me I guess the some of the greatest gifts that were given what I was given at the end of my journey was to be taken deep into the future and was given the privilege of experiencing this what I'm calling the future human the the child that we are giving birth to what the future human feels like looks like and if I tried to describe it to you I'll probably end up weeping because it was so beautiful this being was so beautiful so magnificent we were talking about a healed humanity truly healed right down to our bones a humanity with an absolutely radically expanded heart what Christians look at Jesus and called the sacred heart the heart the one heart a mind open to the intelligence of the universe in new and profound ways a truly enlightened humanity one in all just a magnificent shift in the common ground of human experience and I believe that just as a mother when she has her baby in her arms after a hard labor forgets the labor at one level because the child is with her down likewise humanity will is going through this very very intense birth process but when this birth sees its goal when the child is born when the future human is born on the earth and I don't have any particular vision of again how when I don't know whether it's this long gradual or it's a sudden cathartic thing but when this child is born in history we will look back on the terrible pains that we went through to give birth to it and we'll say it was worth it maybe if we had been smarter we could have done it easier and faster maybe we brought some of this on our own heads unnecessarily but when the child is born it will be worth it yeah you pose the question in your book you said what is the value of true but temporary knowledge moving into these planes and coming back and being able to sustain them you mentioned you have different answers at different times and so I thought it'd be interesting to to ask what what is your answer to it at the moment at this time mm-hmm well the soft underbelly if if we do this work in order to facilitate not simply temporary highs or temporary you know insights but if we do it in order to encourage or facilitate a maturation of our psycho-spiritual life which leads ultimately to a shift in the on the ground of our consciousness an abiding shift to shift not only into peak experiences but a shift into Plateau experiences if we approach psychedelic experience with this long term maturational view then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature you know we enter into these states you can't stay there we're going to be in there only for a few hours at a time and then we come out we have to kind of reconcile ourselves with the limitations of the the practice that we are engaging in but if we use those hours carefully if we use them conscientiously I believe they do accelerate our evolution and then they can by showing us where we are going they can they begin to act as kind of strange attractors drawing us into our individual individual and collective evolution faster more deeply and so it is frustrating to sort of you know at two o'clock in the afternoon to be so deeply immersed in the wisdom of the universe and then by 10 o'clock that night you know they're your ordinary mind has congealed around your self again and no matter how hard you try you're not living in the same reality that you were in before the value what is the value of true but temporary knowledge and I think in my case at least I pushed myself perhaps deeper than was wise into deep deep temporary knowledge and so again if I were doing it over again knowing what I know now I would be more patient with a slower pace of my own personal evolution I would and and the way this manifested for me is I reached a point after 20 years of this work where I knew it was time for me to stop my sessions and more importantly the consciousness that I was engaging knew it was time for me to stop and it ended our sessions I did not think they were going to end I did not know we were ending but after this very very deep what I call the final vision the last of my great visions in the 70th session there were three sessions which I call the goodbye sessions it it basically drew our work together to a close and I had been given so many blessings and had been so many Joy's on the journey I thought that I could simply withdraw and I would be able to be nurtured for the rest of my life by these blessings and I had been and and that is true but there's something else that happened and that is I began to to experience a profound existential loneliness because I was not able to go back into this deep deep intimacy with the divine in even though I continued to do spiritual practice the spiritual practices that I was doing if I did them from multiple lifetimes perhaps I would be able to move back there but in this lifetime I knew I would not reach that deep until I died and I found myself very at leave just waiting to die so I could return to my beloved and that that's not a good way to live and it took me a while to me literally ten years after I stopped my sessions to get fully grounded to recommit myself into living within my incomplete self inside time and space with some contentment for the remainder of my years and that's why I think true but temporary knowledge can be very valuable transcendence can teach us who we are it can teach us what we're doing here it can teach us maybe what the purpose of our life is but if you plunge too deeply into transcendence as I did I think it can also undermine your sense of belonging to the earth and that is an equally important lesson that it took me a while to you know kind of reground myself in after I stock my sessions but the other thing I found it was so hard after I stopped it wasn't just the loss of communion it was the sickness of silence it was having to stay silent about my psychedelic experiences I'm a teacher I love to get to learn new things and to share that learning with others but in my society I was never allowed to bring my experiences to my colleagues to bring my experiences to my students I always had to keep silent about my psychedelic experiences because they were illegal and but now that I've retired I retired from my university a little early in order to write diamonds from heaven or LSD in the mind of the universe and now you know I've given myself permission I'm passed the statute of limitations for these psychedelic crimes and now I can say whatever I damn well please and that's quite it is liberating it's because it's like coming out of a psychedelic closet it's just as liberating as coming out of any closet where we are forced to deny the truth of our being and so writing this book has really been very healing and facilitated a deeper level of my own experiences because now that I can talk about them now that I can just talk about them freely and receive other people's experiences freely in the expanded psychedelic conversation now I can be in my physical existence who I have been also in my shamanic psychedelic existence so the two halves of my life are coming back together and I'm beginning to be experienced levels of wholeness as an incarnate being that I could not experience as long as I was being forcibly held silent to my experiences would you say you have any happiness or contentment from your experiences obviously I completely empathize and understand with that separation and that I don't know if it's a feeling of rejection but certainly like the Reve menteur I'm not being able to return to those those very unique landscapes and those unique feelings but with in now in life post sessions have you found a deeper happiness and contentment are you still around us often says he hasn't cured one neurosis so his entire spiritual journey and he still he ever used to be and so he he never really changed nor found much much deeper deeper liberation I guess how is it for you hmm wonderful Ram Dass what an interesting man absolutely great respect there is a deep relaxation when you I have had so many existential questions answered I've had so many existential pains soothed with the clarity of truth of experience I feel I've been given a much deeper understanding an appreciation for how life works and in that knowing in in that philosophical and spiritual knowing there is a great relaxation and a sense of deeper cooperation with life more than that there's been in the intimacy with the creative intelligence of the universe and experiencing the depth of love that the universe pours into me into each of us into all of us together there's just been such a there has been a profound spiritual fruition which probably has not cured me of all my falls but I certainly hope it's tilted the balance and has helped me become a kinder person a a calmer person a more compassionate person you know enlightenment that's a tricky thing maybe one day but if I were really aiming for enlightenment as this is classically conceived living in a condition of deep transparency to our eternal abiding nature living perpetually conscious of that aspect of our nature which never begins never ends its purpose is never divided it is the the unchanging truth on which all changing truths dance if that were the goal of this work I would have done the work differently I would have worked with very very small doses the purpose of my work or the project of my work it began kind of pursuing enlightenment but it became that just fell away early on the work became to support the enlightenment of my people to support the transformation of humanity as a whole and then beyond that it became a process of cosmic exploration to enter as deeply as I could into the inside of the universe and was given the opportunity to see things and experience things that are went far beyond my ability to stabilize as an abiding consciousness when I returned so it's not from this perspective I don't consider myself a Li's of attempted enlightenment I see them as successes of of cosmic exploration and which of course is related to the condition of awakening our enlightenment at one level but at another level it's different it's really quite different you don't have to go back to the beginning of the Big Bang to be enlightenment you don't have to experience archetypal reality you don't have to experience the future evolution of humanity to be enlightened this is a just a different project I hope however in the deepening intimacy with the divine I hope there's been some progress towards spiritual awakening up you know healing the fragments of that we all carry from our historical experiences I feel a deep peace and contentment and perhaps most notably not only am I not afraid of dying I'm looking forward to it it's absolutely no fear for me because I know I know where I'm going yeah and I know where we're going you know we're going deeper into that light so if you're if there were one thing I wish I could give to other people from my experiences it would be this loss of fear of death because if you're afraid of dying your entire cosmology is upside down yes this is where this is the hard place this is the time spaces where the hard work is done spiritual reality is is its its reward it's home it's light have you been tempted in these later years to go back I you know aldous huxley on his deathbed his wife injected him with a large amount I think is around 500 micrograms of LSD and read him the Tibetan Book of the Dead have you been tempted to go back into a high dose session all these years which I think it's been 20 years hasn't it yeah actually he was injected with two low dose sessions very low doses yeah just low and Laura Huxley discusses this in her biography of autobiography no I mean I've done I've done low dose sessions with LSD in the years since I stopped but generally I find it it doesn't work well with me now I mean I've had wonderful experiences but I've pushed my system so hard with the high doses that it is almost as if I've developed an allergy for it and and if I were to take a massive dose of LSD today I would not be able to get back to where I was regularly journeying in the last year's of my work and it has to do with energy every step into a deeper level of reality is it moves you into a more intense level of energy and there is an accumulation of energy that builds up in your being in your over multiple sessions so I found that my system was accumulating energy storing this energy from session after session even though those sessions were months apart it was accumulating a massive quantity of energy which would then focus that energy and lead to a breakthrough into a new level of consciousness so those breakthroughs are being paid for not simply by hours of intense psychedelic work there sometimes we're being paid for by years a psychedelic work so if I wanted to get back into some of the territory I was exploring of the diamond luminosity that territory I think it would take me year of conscientious work to develop the momentum the energetic momentum to tap that deeply into the universe again so at this point in my life I'm content with more conventional spiritual practices a daily meditation practice if I do use psychedelics sometimes I use gentler psychedelic psilocybin or ayahuasca which basically helps connect me to the fields of knowledge that continue to surround me deriving from my my LSD work so I experienced them not as breaking new ground but is helping me integrate and absorb what I've already done into my present being which is how I experienced my my meditation practice I'm not trying to go back to where I was into my most intense psychedelic experiences I'm not trying to break new ground I'm simply facilitating a deeper absorption of the reality that I touched on those days into my physical being like Alan Watts famous adage when you've got the message hang up the phone what are your thoughts on that well that's no I don't thought I would just say that's not been my experience I mean this is Houston Smith to use that adage he had had about he says in his book cleansing the doors of perception after he'd had about a half-dozen psychedelic experiences the bummers increased and it just really wasn't working for him and my experience is it's when the bummers increases when the deeper cleansing is taking place and that's when it begins to get interesting that's only when death starts to really pound on you that you're hard that it really begins to get interesting when you're having to lay your life on the line then it's getting interesting so to me if we say once you get the message hang up the phone well okay but what is the message and there's so many messages and so many levels nobody judges for another but to me there are messages that come through in the early work and they're magnificent and there are messages that come through in the middle work and their messages that come through in the later work and if I had stopped with the early messages it would have been perfectly okay absolutely perfectly okay but I would have missed some of the things that came later yes though - you know so I think everybody has to make the choices of how much is good for them how much serves them and then whether it becomes counterproductive and I'll own right up front that I think I bit off a little bit more not not more than I could chew because I chewed it all but I bit off more maybe than was wise for for me to buy it off yeah well you know Chris thank you very much for your time here and this conversation it's really has been brilliant and you've been massively inspiring in my life and and I know the lives of many others that are involved in these kind of paths and pursuits and these things that sometimes can seem so foreign and so abstract that when when you've taken the time as you have done to rigorously catalogue everything you went through over these years and put it in a book for some of us to read that is very reassuring because it can it can let us know that what's happening to us and what's happening to others is not just some random random happening it's like what it it happened to this guy I mean he's got a PhD and he's a teacher and he lives a very normal life and and so you're not completely insane and that's what your book has done for me and for many others I thank you for that Thank You Ryan it truly is a it's an honor to have this discussion with you thank you for the privilege of being able to share this time together it's a true joy for me and a privilege in my old age just to be able to have these kind of conversations speak you are there's a whole new generation and a generation behind this generation which is going into this territory and we all have a lot to learn from each other yes so your book is available on Amazon and I don't know if you have a website do you Kris you know I'm afraid it's not finished yet it will be out I hope in a month or two I've just been slow and busy I've just moved to North Carolina it's load up some of these things but the website will be crisp acecomm and but for the time being people can find my articles and essays on a website called academia.edu and and the book is on Amazon yep and it's also very nicely enjoyed as an audio book on audible which I can recommend to people because it's read by you also so I think yeah I enjoyed that I think the written the word the spoken word has a power even beyond the written word and I really enjoy what value the opportunity to be able to read the book for for listeners absolutely okay Chris well thank you very much yeah and they go so yep thank you Chris thank you love and blessings [Music]</p>

Well, here we are again

for our third discussion. And we tentatively gave the topic

for our-- this discussion limitless time, because we now want to bridge and-- into the deeper questions

surrounding reincarnation, the deeper perspective.

Where is reincarnation taking humanity? Where is this constantly learning

and recycling and recycling, creating new and new platforms in our incarnational experience

- where is it going? Where is it taking us? What might the deep future look like? And, most importantly, how might that understanding shift how we

engage our life right here, right now? Yeah. Very deep questions to follow. Where should we begin? Well, we should-- I think we should

acknowledge that each of us have a deep, experiential basis that we're

kind of bringing to this discussion. We're not simply thinking about it, philosophising about it

and speculating about it. We have deep convictions born

out of unusual experiences. Why don't you speak first? It's true. It's why-- it's in a way that's brought us together around these-- to

do these dialogues, I think. And I was just explaining to-- you know, that to discriminate the difference

between knowledge and wisdom. You know, so, although we've explored strains of knowledge in

this, wisdom is different from knowledge. It's the opposite in a way, because, for me, the way I understand wisdom is

that wisdom comes through revelation. It comes through listening. It comes through being

passive and then receiving. Whereas knowledge is something

that you do opposite. You go after it,

you chase it, you hunt it, you know. You're going towards it, instead

of allowing it to come towards you. And so you get different information through revelation. And it's not information in the same way. It's cellular. You know, so my experience that's led to me being me, and doing what

I do, is because I have always had this, you know, cellular understanding, cellular

knowing of what's coming for humanity. And it's always-- it's quite hard to hold

that - I'm sure you relate to that, Chris. It's quite hard to hold it because

it's-- not everyone else has it. And so it puts you-- it puts me in a-- I'm more relaxed than most people I know

at a fundamental level, because I have this knowing

that everything's going to be fine. And I can't explain that knowing, or even why it was

given to me to have it. And I know that many

people listening to this will have a resonance, and have had breakthroughs and visions

where that has come to them. So, you know-- I think it's really good for us

to acknowledge it, that we carry this other dimension. And you obviously through your work,

I mean, tell us a little bit about that. It would be lovely to hear. I completely share what you're saying, because I do carry an unusual knowledge,

as you do. Now, at the beginning of our series, we talked about

the evidence for reincarnation. So I was in my professorial mode there. The intellectual digesting

of this evidence. And the middle-- the second conversation was

kind of a blending of that type of knowledge and the type of wisdom,

that arises in my psychedelic work. And in today's discussion, I feel like I'm standing squarely within

that other side of my life. I'm a visionary shaman. I'm a psychedelic visionary. My understanding comes out of the careful

distilling of conscientiously-engaged, non-ordinary states of consciousness,

again and again and again purifying and purifying, and allowing the universe

to take me deeper and deeper into what I experience as into itself

and into its intention - into time, literally into deep time,

and giving me experiences which were never intended

to be just for me. They are planted in me to hold and then

to pass on, as so many of you know, anyone who has these deep experiences,

you know, they're never just for us. We hold them for the larger collective. So I do - like you I have a feeling for what's happening in history,

where we're going. And it does tend to-- it gives me a calm and a relaxation, even as we enter into very difficult

and trying times ahead. Yeah, I think so. And I think both you and I have that same kind of knowing, I suppose, that birth is an intense event and we're coming to a birth point. You know we're even in the canal,

and contractions are occurring. And in the same way that,

you know, I understand individual awakening, when awakening comes into a body,

you know, and it comes spontaneously, it kind of comes through contractions,

in a sense. So often before you have an experience, and a transcendental experience,

there are kind of shudders. And then there's openings and closings, there's condensing and intensification

of shadow material. And then there's a kind of opening up. And then there's another birth contraction. And the contractions come

closer and closer together. And eventually there's a deep opening to

an epiphany of some form, like something that shakes the core

of your being and maybe fires within your DNA. So that it's something that just sets you alight

and changes you forever, you know, when those revelations come. And so, you know, I think that that's what's happening

on a planetary level as well. It's beginning to happen as a collective. And your writings, Chris,

particularly through your 'Mind of the Universe', you know,

'Diamonds' book, it describes so beautifully this process of, like, coming into-- coming down

the birth canal. What it doesn't do, obviously, and what neither of us can do,

is fill in the details, you know, and only time can do that. But we'd like to give a bit of backdrop and

both empathise with the intensity of the suffering that is already here,

and is most likely going to be ramped up. We want to empathise with that. But at the same time,

we want to present this knowing that we have

that gives people hope, more than hope, actually. But it also provides

some hope, doesn't it? Like, there is a purpose to the events that are taking place on our

planet right now, and right now is whenever you're

watching this. You know, because one can only imagine more events occurring as this canal opens up. So yeah. Yeah. You described that process of the in-breaking of the vision

and the being drawn into the deep experience of revelation. Because, you know, deep visions, deep insights, cannot fit themselves

into small containers. And so when nature, or the Divine, or the universe, invites us into a deeper experience,

a more conscious understanding of life, it has to purify ourselves. And you described

that contracting process. And it is our past, it's everything about

us which keeps us small, being burned up inside us in order to

allow ourselves to be taken, shattered. In my context, it's the death-rebirth

cycle, to die to everything within us which holds us where we are,

and to be reborn into a larger world. And that can happen again and again, taking us deeper and deeper

into that knowing. It's like any spiritual path, there are no shortcuts,

and there's no easy way into this. It's always a very exacting and a very demanding road. But the fruit of that road is, well, it's personal, and it's collective, it expands around us in all sorts

of subtle and mysterious ways. And we are part of a lineage, each of us in our own ways, a lineage of people who have asked

for more, and who have been given more, and have paid the price

for being given more. And you're right, this is-- my work started

as thinking of my psychedelic work as kind of a personal healing, or personal

transformation, or personal awakening, and that just got shattered

in the first few years. And everything about my word kept opening

up into collective vistas, collective spaces, being drawn

into the collective psyche, going through collective purifications and opening up into insight about our

collective developmental process. Experiencing reincarnation not simply as an individual soul-journey,

but as a species-journey. It's a journey that our entire species is on,

evolving itself through the systematic reincarnation,

generation after generation, moving forward and then being given a certain understanding about -- that this reincarnation process for us individually, and collectively,

is coming into a crescendo. It's coming into some type of

profound breakthrough, and you've languaged it as a 'birth'. And I think that's absolutely correct. And birth involves labour, and it involves

a change from one state to another state. For a child, it's a change from a

water-being to a land-being. And we are, I think, are growing from a state of individual

egoic-awareness, where identity is fundamentally our body

-mind-ego, into a soul-awareness, where all of our former lives are coming

together in a tremendous fusion point. As our knowledge of our past deepens,

and as we heal the traumas of our past that we're all carrying,

and our past lives become more integrated,

and we integrate not only their pains but their virtues, their

great assets, their capacities. And all of this begins to take place. And it's like our lives come together,

and eventually they hit a fusion point. And at that point the soul

becomes one, totally, as I've experienced this,

an explosion of light, an explosion into a higher order

of individuality, with a different threshold, a different

sense of communion with the surrounding intelligence of the universe,

the intelligence of the Divine. But-- and it's a different-- to me, if humanity is going through this process,

which I deeply believe it is, that's what my visions have

shown me, again and again. It represents a new foundation for the human story,

a new phase of the human story. Just as profound as when we made this jump, about

200,000 years ago, to a brain that's 50% bigger than the brain that we

were carrying before. Allowing us to think and do things

that we could never do before. This is something which is going to change

the fundamental archetypal architecture of the collective unconscious. Yeah, beautifully said. It kind of brings

two things I'd like to say in response, which are really reiterations

of what you've said. And the first is that many people watching this, if you're drawn to this kind of material, there's a very good chance

that you have said 'yes' to receiving, to transmuting

more shadow material, you know, more than one lifetime's worth. And I remember those dark days

of my kind of past, in which the shadow-- the level of shadow inside my body

seemed insurmountable, you know, and seemed endless. You know, whenever I would meditate, I would just find endless weight

and heaviness and oppression. And, like, so much of it that

it was just this big, thick clot. And how would I ever,

ever burn through that? And gradually, over the years,

happily for me, and it's lightened. And so I've seen the light

at the end of the tunnel. And I say this because I know that many

watching this will also have that experience of

grappling with a weight inside the physical, emotional reality,

the mental reality, that far outweighs, you know, the kind of-- the individual

wounding patterns of one life, you know, whatever they are. And that's not to kind of,

you know, put them lesser, but, you know, we've taken on more. And the reason we've taken on more is

because we are capable of taking on more. So if you feel that heaviness and weight in you, it's because

you have the capacity. The deep, overwhelming, you know, the love that's great enough to burn through that. So I say that to encourage people to continue on in your transformational

path and not to lose hope. And the other thing

I wanted to say is, you know, when you look at

times like this, like birth, and as you said, there's something

that emerges that is completely new. When we're looking at life as it is today, through the lens of history,

we see a continuity. You know, we see this continuity,

this fairly unbroken continuity, with blips, and ups and downs,

and cycles repeating, and we see that through the patterns

of our recorded history. And the one thing

we never-- you never see in birth is you can't see beyond the break, because at some point there's

a break in the continuity. And then something completely new is born. As you said, it's assembled out

of all the elements of the old. It's condensed, it's revealed from all

those elements coming into a symphony. And so it's completely different. It stands on the shoulders of all that, of all that's great and all that's

been suffering. And all of that is suddenly kind of compressed,

like the beginning of the universe. You know, it was compressed

into this tiny space. And that's what happens is

this incredible compression. And then there's this opening,

as you said, an expansion of vast light. So what I'm pointing towards

is that what's coming has no similarity to what we have now. We cannot-- you know with our wildest

imagination, we can begin to approach it, but you have to-- you know you never

see a break in continuity coming. You always assume, all of you,

humans, this is our way. We see that things have

always been this way. They'll always continue. Maybe we're going to continue

on this path, and then we'll get robotics and we'll get technology, and we'll get

this, and then we'll go to the stars. And, you know, we think in the way

that we've been trained to think, until one of these crux points comes. And then it just smashes everything. And, in a way, a whole new epoch begins, something completely new

with different technology, you know, and we're the technology,

you know, we are the technology! I've been saying this to people, like, it's inside us. You know our DNA has capacities,

undreamed-of capacities. And so I think it's really important

that people grasp that, that what's coming bears no resemblance

to what has been, you know. Yes, I completely agree with you. I mean this is what happens

in a psychedelic session as well. I mean I-- first, I completely

affirm what you're saying about the weight and the burden that so many serious

practitioners are experiencing. I think it's because there's a lot of their past, which is past lives' Karma

which they're working and clearing now. But it's also collective karma, that great beings, and I think there are many

more hidden saints than we might think, they have taken on responsibility for working

on behalf of humanity as a whole, so that they are engaging darkness

that comes not just from their personal history or soul history,

but from our collective history. And we have to get through

this period quickly. We have to bring about this transformation or cooperate with this process,

because as every mother knows, you don't want the foetus to get

stuck in the birth canal. It's not a good place to be. We want to keep everything moving through. And I think that many, many souls incarnating in this period of history

saw what they were getting into, knew what they were getting into,

and chose to do this work. The work of birthing a new

humanity is great work. And, you're right, it's a discontinuity. In a session you go deep, deep, deep into the pain, and it just looks

like it's never, ever, ever going to end. You can't imagine how this

will ever reconcile itself. And then there is a breaking point. There's a point of absolute surrender,

of absolute cost paid. And then there is a waking-up, a waking-up in a new reality which is not an

extension of the old reality in any way. You can't get to this new reality by refining, purifying and even

healing the old reality. It is being catapulted

in something which is a fundamentally -- a new genre of experience,

a new set of capacities. In my experience and my sessions,

when I've been taken deep into the experience of deep-time,

into the deep future, that's how I have experienced

the course of humanity as well. That we seem to be first many, many visions over and over, and of course my visions,

these are old \[inaudible\]. I started having these visions in 1991,

so these are pushing 30 years old now, but a series of visions that we

are coming to a turning point. The pace of the past could not be used to measure

the pace of the future. A turn-- a before-and-after point, that

after this historical transition we would be operating at a completely

different psycho-spiritual structure. We would be generating a different civilisation,

because we would be different beings. We would not be confined and fragmented

the way we are now. I mean basically our relationship with nature that we are experiencing now,

the damage that we've done to nature, was done by a species operating out

of the egoic level of consciousness, which is a fundamentally-- which is a brilliant

level of consciousness. But it's fragmented. It's fragmented from each other. It's fragmented from foundational-- from the

foundation of life itself. A species which is operating with a healed heart and a healed mind,

an open heart that embraces the great breath of its own

experience and human experience, and an open mind which is open

to a deeper communion, a deeper taking-in from higher orders of intelligence,

higher orders of knowing, such a being lives in the world differently than a human being does today. The soul lives in the world

differently than the ego. The soul knows that the world that it leaves is the world

that it's coming back to. So it takes better care of the world. The soul knows that its relationships

have a depth of texture and history. You don't walk away

from any relationships. And so you take more care of all of your relationships

and of all the people in that too, because this is an ongoing

developmental process. And I think we are coming

into a point where the irony is life is not giving us any option

except to go through this transition. There's no going back. The Earth is not going to allow us. We've done so much damage to it. This damage is coming up to us now. We cannot continue living, even in a simplified version

of how we have gotten here. We have to reach into something

entirely new, something radically new. And I think you're right,

that this is happening on the outside, and we are being called to a new

relationship to the Earth on the outside, but we are carrying within our hearts all the problems that have

gotten here-- gotten us here. And we are carrying all the values,

and the potentials, and the insights which are taking us beyond this

into a different order. It's all inside. You and I focus our work

on the inside dance. There are other people whose work is

to focus on the outside dance, to bring out the changes in the outer

world to get us through. All are needed. So true and, you know, beautifully put,

and the inner transformation that you just described-- I mean, one thing that

I'm reminded of, those, if you know-- if anyone's

seen or is familiar with any of Shakespeare's plays, particularly

the comedies and the tragi-comedies, you know, like in some of those plays

everything that can go wrong goes wrong. And the wrong people fall in love

with the wrong people. The-- everything gets twisted round. It's like one of those nightmares where

it's just, like-- and you've got to act four, and usually there's five acts,

and it's still a complete mess. And your-- and as-- in the audience

you're going, 'Oh, my God. How is this ever going to be resolved?' And then he does this magical thing, where suddenly there's a kind of strange

attractor that comes in, some force, or some event,

that just suddenly triggers all these, like, sub-events that makes everyone

end up with the right person. And everything just gets healed

and is 'happily-ever-after' story. But it happens very quickly, you know, always right

compressed in the last moment. And in a way it's a bit similar, our time, because we've

had this long, slow, you know, build-up to create this mess. And then there's this sudden kind of, you know, cataclysmic energy at the end,

that then just-- in which you could never quite see how these things

are all going to be resolved. But they get resolved, and in a completely different way from what

we-- you were expecting. So, you know, I-- and one of the things that you've spoken of a lot, Chris,

is the speed at which things happen. And we can see that in natural systems, you can just see it in water boiling. It's the most obvious one, perhaps. You look at the water and nothing seems to be happening, and nothing

seems to be happening. And you put more and more and more heat into it, and then some

bubbles start to appear, just the first little pricks

of bubbles on the surface. And then, of course, suddenly,

when it hits that one boiling point, everything just erupts. And you have steam, you know. And this water starts

to just change its state. And it's such a simple metaphor. But it's so true

throughout the whole of nature. And if you look at the whole

of humanity and history, you know, in a way that's what those-- that's a period

that's a-- that we're reaching. And we'll begin to see that more and more. And the scientists

are pointing to those things, like the ocean, for example, is capturing a huge amount of CO2,

and it's called 'the sink'. You know, it's just-- it's sinking

down deep into the deep ocean where that CO2 is being stored. And it's slowly building up, and building up, and building up until the ocean

will be able to no longer capture any more CO2. And from that point onwards, and

it's allegedly already occurred, it weakens. Its ability to store CO2 weakens and therefore

all the CO2 that we're creating suddenly explodes into the atmosphere. And it looks like we've

been in this hiatus, you know, and we have because there's

this illusion that we've been okay. And then suddenly everything speeds up much more quickly than

anyone could possibly have conceived, except some of the scientists who really know that,

who've really analysed the data deeply. And also, you know, cross-- people who work across multiple fields,

you know, systems theorists and people who really see the interconnectivity

of different systems can see the whole. And, of course, mystics, like us. So there are many who are, kind of,

predicting very, very quick change that can be very

destabilising for this planet. And I know you-- I'd love to hear what you saying

-- what I want to say about this but-- and we don't say to alarm, but to prepare. Because it goes alongside

the inner awakening. As the inner birth takes place, something on the outside,

the structure, has to decline, it has to fall away in order for

this new \[waves hands\] to come through. It's a universal law, and it's essential, you know, as you said, we can't repair the old system. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try

and repair the old system. Because there can be one,

you know, hearing all this, you can think, 'Well, I'm not going to do anything then,

I'm just going to sit here.' And that's an understandable response, and yet it's not

a truly compassionate response, you know, because

compassion also involves passion, and we need to stand up for

what's right, and for justice, and what else-- what is

the purpose of being here? So we need to continue forwards and use our passion wherever

we are called to do so. That's part of our responsibility, and that's part of what it

means to be an awakening being. And yet at the same time, we can have this

other part of us that knows, 'Well, I'm going to do whatever I can

while this is collapsing. You know, I'm going to give-- I'm going to

serve in the best way I possibly can.' And that's how you know that you will always be in the right place,

you'll always be in a safe place. And when I say 'safe', I mean safe in the sense that you're aligned with

the core of your soul and its destiny. That's a safe place to be. Yeah, that place of alignment, yeah. You know the way

that speeding-up process worked itself out in my sessions, and it had to do with understanding

the field dynamics of consciousness. I have just enough understanding of chaos theory and non-equilibrium systems to have

a rudimentary understanding of what physicists, or chaoticians understand - when the system gets more

and more energy poured into it, it reaches a state of non

-equilibrium or far-from-equilibrium. And when it's in that condition like

the water, which is getting more and more energy poured into it, or a bathtub when

you keep increasing the quantity of water that's going into the tub,

and the ripples get-- they start to change, we come to a tripping point-- a tipping

point, a bifurcation point, where the system has too much energy

to maintain its current structures, and it does a flip into a different

organisational pattern. It goes through this bifurcation point,

it chooses a different future. It flips into a higher

organisational pattern. And when physical systems

reach non-equilibrium points, they can do extraordinary things. They can produce new particles. They can produce orders of coherence within themselves that would have been

impossible at a lower energy state. In my visionary experiences,

I was given to see that all of humanity, we are all fractal nodes within unified

field, a field of consciousness, the human unconscious, the collective

unconscious is a field, and it is an energetic field which reflects

all of our individual experiences. And when enough individual experiences become untenable,

when they become so painful, we just reach out in desperation

for a different solution to the situation - it's not just we individually are going

through this type of ordeal of transformation,

but all of us collectively. We've never had anything happen in history which is comparable

to what's coming at us now. Because when we've had hurricanes or great

natural disasters, they've always affected one part of the world,

but not the other part of the world. But the global systems crisis that seems

to be imminent, being driven by a global ecological crisis,

is going to affect all continents, all people, all places. That's going to push humanity into a different experiential field. And the point here is that the collective psyche is going to be energised

by all of this disruption. It literally is going to begin to boil underneath us, underneath our

individual minds. And my understanding

of what's happening is that in evolution there are, kind of, multiple levels of evolution, at least,

say, two levels of evolution. We and I are being born

over and over again. We're born for 100 years at a time -

we live 100 years, 100 years. But underneath those 100 year cycles, there is a learning taking place, there is

a developmental process taking place. We usually refer to this as the soul. So the individual ego incarnates, but the soul is growing, becoming more,

becoming more, suffusing our lives. But the same thing happens collectively. Every generation, every generation, billions and billions of people are being born, but there is a learning

gathering underneath them, that is collecting all of their learning in these deep, deep,

collective archetypal structures. That's what's coming to boil,

not just our individual incarnation, but that underlying structures

coming into a high energy state. And I think it's coming to a state where the sheer energy of our suffering, the energy of our despair,

or the energy of our anxiety, is driving us to a breaking point where suddenly we're going to be flooded

with a different kind of common sense, a different common sense,

a different set of priorities, a different set of values,

a different experience of each other. The only way I think that we can go as far as we need to go in order

to save ourselves, and the planet in as little time as we have,

is to understand the dynamics of the collective unconscious,

the field-dynamics of consciousness and that-- how fields operate

in non-equilibrium systems. At least this is what

has come through my visionary experience, over and over,

that we are coming to a point where there is a crisis which builds

in intensity, until it looks like all is lost. So much disruption,

so much loss of control, so much death, challenged at a very deep level. But when it's at its worst it begins to pass. We pick ourselves up. We somehow rise to the

challenge of this crisis. And in rising to the challenge, we are changed, we are profoundly changed,

such that as we become-- start to come out of this period

of history, we find that what our nature, the nature that we are carrying,

its not just a different set of attitudes, not just a different set of beliefs,

but a fundamental-- a fundamentally new way of being conscious. A new organisation of our

consciousness emerges. Something has shifted in place. And we find that things which

were not easy are suddenly easy. Things which are out of reach

are suddenly within reach. Possibilities are emerging much faster

than we would have ever predicted. That's the type of transformation

I think we're looking at. A truly-- a rebirth of humanity, so that-- in my work, I call it 'the

birth of the future human.' You know it's truly a demarcation of a different

kind of human being emerging. Now, I think our history is creating this. It's reincarnation, which is

coming to a phase of fruition. And I think we can get insights, or glimmers of what the future

will look like by looking at the great beings of our past, the great saints,

the great prophets, the great incarnations, the Christs,

the Buddhas, the prophets, those great beings who have always called

us into a higher order of existence. Those are prototypes, I think.

The prototypes which give us an inclination and an understanding

of what we are in the process of becoming as a species, collectively.

I think we are truly becoming a species of Christs,

a species of Buddhas, a species of prophets, you know, with that magnitude,

that tremendous scale of heart. I don't know how long it's going to

take us to make this transition. Clearly, the ecological crisis, which is fermenting, is a crisis that's

going to be deepening for generations. It will be at least three

generations, four generations before we hit the peak of these-- of this crisis. But I think we will come through it. And I think we're not talking

thousands and thousands of years, we're talking-- we have to make

this within a few hundred years to make this transition. And I think the 21st century

is the key century of the unravelling - it is where we

make key choices that shape our future. And one of the other things that happens in non-equilibrium systems is that

individual changes, small changes can catapult into massive outcomes. So the butterfly, whose wing in China sets off a hurricane

across the planet - that metaphor that individuals who have

achieved within themselves something of what humanity

is aspiring to change for solving these large problems - the impact of individuals

increases exponentially in non-equilibrium systems. So, just in contrast, if we look just to the past we say, 'Well,

the individual can't do anything. We're being overwhelmed by-- just it's overwhelming historical forces are

coming at us.' It's just the opposite. As things intensify, the individual becomes more significant, a more

significant player. So beings who achieve a wholeness within their person,

they achieve a robust soul-consciousness in their person,

have a tremendous catalysing effect on people around them,

coming to their own version of that deep experience as well. Thank you. I love listening to you,

when you go off on a transmission. I was thinking, you know, if you were to ask yourself what one thing-- if there was one thing that happened on this planet

that could change everything quickly overnight,

what might that one thing be? And inside me the answer was-- it is that for us to see

through the veil of death. You know, because the moment one person sees through the veil of death,

fear is no more, it just isn't. There is no fear

because that's where fear resides. So the intensification of the energy you're talking

about, the suffering, you know, the love, all of it pouring towards this one

kind of point, this-- you know, it's the only thing that has the power

to pierce that veil, that veil of death. And so what I would expect, and what I have sort of seen through the Gene Keys and through

my teachings and transmissions, is that more and more people will gradually, as this boiling takes place, experience their consciousness, you know, having the ability to transcend life, birth and death, that cycle of life, you know. And be able to-- that

consciousness will retain the memory between life, birth and death, and carry it across. And what that-- you know, because that's pure awakening

and when a being has that layer-- that level of awakening,

and they're sitting there manifesting, or standing there just moving

around being who they are and that is being emanated,

it is electrifying. It's electrifying to anyone else,

it's catching, it's contagious. You know, the transmission of wisdom, and love, and awakening

is contagious, you know, most people will know this. You go near one of these beings and

you can feel it, it crackles in the air. And so the more and more that is occurring,

the more and more this veil of-- will be breaking down. And then fear will start to leave this planet gradually,

person-by-person, person-by-person, generation-by-generation. And I even believe deep inside myself that that will enable children to come through,

to be born, without the wound of humanity. You know, just be born awake, you know, and therefore not have those-- not have to

go through this journey. And, of course, those children are us,

those are our future vehicles, and they will be born

through those awakened ones. You know, because

if you have two awakened ones coming together to bring a child,

then you have a clear conduit. You know, and that's a vessel

that you might want to jump into, to experience, and then

more, and more of that. And that so, in a way,

you could almost perceive that that's how the awakened consciousness

will colonise the gene pool of humanity. Literally like a virus of love, you know,

it will just begin to spread. And it's non-denominational, it doesn't-- you know,

it's everywhere. It's in the weirdest places,

it's in, you know, the tiny little communities, because it's everywhere. It's not fixed on any chosen people, you know, as in the past. So it's going to wake up. You know, I always like that

one-liner that Jesus left behind him where he said, 'When I return,

I will return like a thief in the night,' you know, and I contemplated

that for many, many years, and one day I just saw that and I was

like, 'Oh, wow, yeah. It's coming, you can't stop it, it's secret,

it's hidden, it's everywhere. It's a thief in the night,

it's just going to arrive.' And it's this, you know, 'new human'

that we're talking about. This is the new human

that we've both seen. And I think many people are sensing, here already among us, in its potential, like you

mentioned the Buddhas and things. And one thing, probably that I loved more

than anything else in your book, Chris, is when you describe the future human,

and I was left with this image of all these Buddhas sitting down,

meditating and stuff, and then this one human

standing in the middle of them, standing on its own two feet,

and that was the future human. And

I thought-- you know, I feel like that's such an enduring,

iconic symbol of what's coming. Because we're no longer-- it's no longer

the journey of meditation and spiritual awakening, and the spiritual journey

and this awakening through transformation of the shadow,

suddenly that's come to an end, and suddenly that being is standing. You know, there's no practice anymore,

other than living. And then that human really begins a new humanity, because there's no more awakening process. There are layers and layers of creative expansion, always infinite

creative expansion. And there's playfulness. And there's new layers of engagement within the construct of reality. You know, all these levels and dimensions and fields that we can explore, you know, through a new way. And what I really see clearly is as that's-- as the age

of suffering comes to an end, you know, we have a new field,

and it's bliss. You know, we have learned enough from suffering, now is our chance

and opportunity to learn from bliss, because bliss

is the other side of suffering. It's the same, it's almost the same thing. It's all that suffering leads to bliss. And yet bliss is just the other -- it's like the white hole to the black

hole, you know, it's like you go through a black hole, you come out the other side,

there's this white hole and it's-- and it has as much

depth and juice as suffering does. You know, so there's a similarity to them but it's a new muse that humanity has. So when we sit in that bliss, and we move through that bliss,

we're moving through the highest aspects of our consciousness,

and that then has to all be explored, all of it. Because bliss, like suffering,

has layer, upon layer, upon layer, upon layer, upon layer and dimension,

and dimension, and dimension. And there's a whole epoch needed

again, just to explore bliss. So that's why, in a way, if you can hold that in your heart and your mind

as we move through these very difficult decades ahead, and

century-- centuries, perhaps few centuries - I agree,

by the way, 21st century is-- seems to be the one,

the next century, you know, seems to be the one

- and, you know, remember that's us. You know, like, we'll be there. And I mean, you know, I say to people,

'You don't want to miss this.' You know, like,

people saying, like, 'This is my last incarnation.' Okay, well,

make sure you come back for that one, because you don't want to do all

this and then not have the reward. We're in it. Yeah, so all things are

possible at that stage. And I think it's really good to bear these things in mind as we're moving

through, you know, intense periods. Let's allow ourselves to look deep into the future

of this future human. Because whatever transformation we're going through, and

we are going through, you know, we agree, we're going through this

acute transformation. We're giving birth to a new

order of human capacity. However long it takes

us to do it, you know, a few hundred years, whatever, the human story is not stopping, the evolutionary drama is not ending. This is simply going to be a new platform within which the human story

will continue to develop. I think you're right that

we have been evolving out of through learning from suffering, that's been the great teacher

in much of our learning in the past. But I think-- and I think you're

right, we are getting past that. We are growing out of that, just as we

are growing out of our fear of death. You know, if there were one thing that I wish I could give people from my sessions,

it would be to lose the fear of death. Because if you're afraid of death, you just have your whole

cosmology upside down. You just don't understand what's going on,

you know, death is graduation, death is the great respite,

death is the great reward. So we're coming into this period of deep

transformation, of living out of bliss, living out of joy,

exploring out of bliss and joy. And I think you're right, it's going

to take us a long time to experience the levels and levels of creativity

that can come out of that. So the divine project has brought us to this crisis. The evolutionary, natural, however you want to envision, the \[inaudible\] project has brought us

to this crisis is taking us through it. We're not doing it. I mean, this is much larger than you or I,

or any individual collection of people. Nature is driving us

through this metamorphosis. Nature has just decided we're ready, we're

time, we're going through this thing. New platform, new beginning. But it's not going to stop. We're here for another million years. We're here for another billion years. So I think we should really look deeply at understanding that we're

not only talking about a kind of new humanity as we can imagine

it now, from our limited position - we're talking about a new humanity beyond our capacity to imagine,

because it is so different. One of the things that happened at the very-- the last vision I was given,

the last session is the session that I call 'diamond vision', because in the session

I was given a ten-minute experience of being able to see

1000 times more clearly, more precisely, more exactly, with more discrimination

than I'd ever been able to see before. It wasn't a hallucination,

it was just absolutely-- I could not imagine that I had accepted the dull experience of ordinary

vision as real vision. And when it disappeared, I realised I had been given an experience of seeing the way the future human,

that all future humans, will see. This isn't just a transformation of our heart and a transformation of our mind,

it's a transformation of our senses, that our touch and taste

and vision and hearing is going to be more and more refined,

more subtle, more exquisite. The capacity of consciousness

to heal the body, to keep it on an even keel, to transform it, the capacity

of consciousness to infuse and lift the body into ecstatic

states of creativity, I mean we're just getting started into actualising some of the higher potentials that are already

built into the human form, but are being activated by this

evolutionary process, setting us on fire. And then the question becomes - well,

what might lie down the road? And we could lose ourselves in maybe projections and fantasies about

that, but the only thing that's really important is to understand, I think,

the high stakes of what's involved here. We're not trying to simply

fix or heal humanity. We are on the threshold

of birthing a different order of human existence, which is going to become the new platform for yet still more higher

orders of human existence. This is a hugely significant

undertaking that we are about. It's not simply trying to

rectify a short-term pass. It's a cascading effect into a very, very different future. It's a very high-stakes game, with very, very great rewards

that are coming in this time. If our nature is truly infinite, as I think we agree it is,

if Brahman and-- Brahman is Atman, the essence of the individual

is the essence of the Divine, our nature is infinite, then reincarnation gives us

an infinite amount of time in order to unfold, and to activate,

our infinite nature. I think if we qualify it carefully, we are learning to be gods. We are learning how to create on a scale

that we've never envisioned except in our mythologies, or in our

science-fiction mythologies. So true, so true. And one of the things that I have seen, and

my way of describing that mythology, is you know, we are-- and I'm not the first person to explore this, you know,

it's these different species or races that are kind of evolving on our planet. And we've been through these before,

actually. You know, so-- and we're part of a much deeper epoch story than we realise. And we may have even

forgotten previous epochs. And because of the break in continuity between

epochs is so massive, you know, so-- but each time we go through one of these

portals, we include and transcend more of, and we remember

more of what came before. So I feel that's also potential, that we remember more of what came before

as we move into what we're becoming. And, in a way, from my understanding, is that this is almost like the final

stage or cresting of humanity's epoch. You know, because it then moves into, you know, the culmination of this next -

since we're looking far, far, far, far ahead - the culmination of

this next species is our collective harmony with the whole of Gaia. It's coming into absolute

harmony with the entirety of Gaia. So taking our highest seat as

the consciousness of Gaia, and as the gardeners of Gaia, as the stewards of Gaia, you know, as

inseparable from the tiniest ant. And, you know, like, everything

being part of our highest capacity here, and the beauty of Gaia. So we haven't yet seen - you know, maybe at the very beginning

- we haven't yet seen Gaia, you know, in her flowered-- flowering state,

fully flowering. You know, with all her essences just released in perfect harmony, and us

being able to move through the garden and sup the nectars of everything here,

all of that. And each animal, and each creature,

and each having their place, you know, within us, because they have a place within us. We are, you know, there is no separation anymore. And so there's this incredible crystallisation of the harmony of all

the architecture of life on Gaia. And my feeling is that this next

phase of our evolution is about the weaving together of Gaia,

of all those creatures and things, and understand-- so every

one of us has a specific weaving role in that, to weave

back together certain neurological pathways that are

unique to us, that only we could weave, because only our creativity

wants to go there. So we follow our creativity and it weaves together some aspect of Gaia.

And then all of us together doing that creates this beautiful

tapestry of wholeness. And the other aspect to this that I've seen is as the process continues,

there's a timeline. It's very strange. It's almost like a spiral,

the arc of time. And as we get closer and closer towards

perfection, the timeline closes in on itself more and more and more, so in a way

time itself is being condensed. And when you get to that final - this is a lovely joke

- when you get to that final crystallisation point of perfection,

time itself dissolves. So, in a way, my joke is that when

you finally get to heaven, it stops.

Everything stops! It's like it's finished. It would look

like from our vantage like, 'Well, there's no time to enjoy it.' But

actually, there's infinite time. Infinite time, yeah.

So that's when humanity finally transcends humanity. You know, and then there's another one of those

epoch shifts, in which-- and, you know, and it's beyond our comprehension. You might even say we then leave this sphere. Our consciousness then

moves to another sphere, and Gaia is left with-- you know, she's not left alone, because

it's a chain, right. So now the animals start to kind of crystallise, and their evolution

starts to continue and \[inaudible\]. So everything ratchets up. And even the rocks and the minerals

are kind of moving up a layer. Everything is interconnected, so

consciousness is embedded in everything, but it awakens in these layers,

in these contractions. And then we move somewhere else,

somewhere, you know, somewhen else. We're beyond the time-space continuum, that we've graduated from this

chain of evolution, this epoch. You know, it's-- and then we

suddenly we're in this-- 'ah'. We realise we're nested as part of something far wider, because we've

remembered, 'Oh, we're galactic!' Gaia was just, like, our playground, our-- that was another birth,

and then we're in a galactic world. And so it goes on, and so it

goes on, and so it goes on, but that's-- You know, when

you go far, far, far ahead and it, like, I know you've

been there, Chris, it's so-- the tapestries are so vast, that-- but they're fractal, right? So they're repeated right down. So when you look at-- you know,

it's like Blake saying, you know, 'eternity in the-- in a grain

of sand, in a wild flower', you know, it's like, it's in everything. The same fractal patterning is

embedded in all-- at all levels. So it's just these waves of wider and wider

awakening and creativity. And that's, you know, that's where we're -- that's where we're going

and that's where we are. And we never leave the present moment,

that's the beauty, we never leave the freedom of the present

moment, even when we're in crisis. You know, and that's what's going

to become-- in a way, for me the most important thing

is that as the crisis comes, we never leave the present moment and we never forget where we're going.

You know, that this is all for a purpose. So that is the-- you know, when we have to swallow the pill of suffering,

of intense suffering, that's the other pill we take, the kind of-- the medicine

that reminds us that the suffering is-- is it has Grace embedded in it. Yeah. I love hearing you go. When you go, you really go. And I love because I feel so deeply resonant

with what you're describing. That this Earth,

this solar system is part of a galaxy, which is part of a super

-cluster of galaxies. Time-space is part of a universe which is part of a larger meta-universe,

which is part of another larger universe. We are going through this very, very

exciting, very important transformation. Humanity is going through this

tremendous transformation. And yet there are other species around the galaxy going through

their own transformations. And so we don't have to deny any of that,

we can affirm all of that while also paying tremendous attention

to what's taking place. How do we

take full advantage of the growth opportunity that this time

in history is giving us right here? Because my understanding is we

choose our incarnations. So that everyone who listens to this video chose to be in history

right here, right now. They chose to be part of this traumatic moment, this birth moment, this

ecstatic exploding moment in history. They chose to be part of it. And they are exactly where they chose to be in order to have

the greatest impact on positive outcome. It's not a matter of searching for

what should I do, or how do I respond? Look under our feet. We are already planted. We have the talents. We have the relationships around us. We are already where we can do the most good if we're willing to take

responsibility and act, and really do it. And that's what you're

talking about being centred in your-- we know when we're centred

in our role in life, we know when we're centred in our work,

even if we're suffering at that moment, we have a deep confidence

that this is what we are to do. There'll be so many distractions

being offered to us to not pay attention. Distract ourselves with movies, distract

ourselves with this, that and the other. It's-- and when things get hard, it's going to be very

inviting to be elsewhere. But if we are really here, right here, right now, putting

all of our endeavour into this moment, that is the fastest way to move through

the harder part and into the joy, into the bliss, into the cooperation,

into the collaborations, into the opportunities for our individual

work, to be-- to meet with fellows on the journey and compound

into larger and larger projects. We won't get there by allowing

ourselves to be distracted. We get there by complete commitment to our

circumstances, where we are as we are. And I think you're right,

in that deep penetration of the present, we get glimpses and touches and tingles of the whole structure, of the meta-universe, which is also pouring its-- all

of its energy into the present. We meet heaven only in the present. We meet the galactic superstructure in the present, in this moment,

in this grand kind of collaboration with destiny. So we wandered a long way from our early talking about what's

the evidence for reincarnation. But the communion with the universe is what

drives both of us, I think. Deep communion, the opportunities

for deepening the communion, for letting go of all the things that get

in our way and going into a deep sharing of the divine breath,

a deep communion of the divine joy. To really let it in as deeply as we can

possibly let it in, in the years that we have remaining, and then our next

incarnation, and our next incarnation. Beautiful, Chris.

Thank you. I don't think I could

add anything to that. I think we've-- I don't think there's

anything else needs to be said. Is there? Maybe not here and now, but certainly

in another time, in another place. We'll wind it up again and we'll launch. I love our discussions. I love \[inaudible\] with you. I love what happens when we get together.

Me too. And I think, you know, our various

different communities will hopefully come together, and explore

these things in new and creative ways. That's certainly, I think, my intention, to continue this dialogue in all kinds of different ways

and to invite others also into this dialogue,

to explore, to create, to come up with, you know, proactive, creative routes forwards in the world, depending,

you know, what is coming to us. And, you know, there's a lot of great genius that's being drawn to these kinds

of discussions and these communities. And when the genius comes together,

it's capable of so much. And I know that many, many hearts are wanting

to come together and be of service, as you said,

to be of the greatest service. So, I think there will be opportunities for

lots of things in the times ahead. So I want to really personally thank you for being a great inspiration

to me, and for-- And likewise, really.

Confirming many of my deep held knowings. And kind of matching me along the journey. And, you know, and sometimes

just really pushing me a little bit further as well,

so I really appreciate that. Likewise, it works both ways. Much love and blessings in your work. And it's just a joy to spend

time with you, it truly is. It opens me up, invites me forward,

I receive much from our conversations. Likewise.

Absolutely.

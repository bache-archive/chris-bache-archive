00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.880
Welcome, everyone,
to a series of talks that I'm doing here

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.520
with my friend Chris Bache,
and we're going to be discussing a subject

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.980
that we're both really interested
in and fascinated by,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.860
which is rebirth and all the things
that go along with rebirth.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.060
Might also call it reincarnation,
because that's part of the story.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.360
And this began, really,
because I read a book by Chris,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.600
a wonderful book called 'LSD
and the Mind of the Universe'.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.200
And

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.020
what it did is it kind of just
triggered a real recognition in me.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.720
And since I'm a teacher of spiritual

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.240
matters and I'm the founder
of a system called the Gene Keys,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.210
that resonance that went off in me,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.210
it caused me to reach out via
email to this amazing man.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.920
And you never know whether you're
going to hear back in those instances.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.520
And Chris very kindly got back to me
and we started a series of dialogues

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.360
and discussions, and we realised that we
really enjoyed having dialogues together.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.360
So that's why we're here.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.052
And we're going to explore this
subject in several sessions.

00:01:38.252 --> 00:01:40.850
So, today, we're going to just begin

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.740
with some introductory concepts and basics
and then see where it leaves us.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.480
So I hope you enjoy it and I'm
very much looking forward to it.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.200
And we're anticipating three discussions.
Absolutely.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.360
So Chris, if you want to say a few things

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.960
about yourself, just so that
people know who you are.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.880
It's a pleasure to meet here.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.000
And I've enjoyed our conversations
that we've had prior to this.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.340
And this present dialogue grew out
of those earlier conversations.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.800
I am a professor of philosophy
and religious studies.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.680
I'm on the religious
studies side of the shop.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.020
I'm retired from Youngstown
State University.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.840
In the course of my teaching,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.730
I've taught courses on world religions
and Eastern religions,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.100
transpersonal psychology of religion
and comparative mysticism, Buddhism.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.890
So I've been teaching in areas touching
on reincarnation for many years.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.520
I have written several books.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.120
My first one was on reincarnation,
starting with the scientific evidence

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.060
for reincarnation, which
we'll be touching on today.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.760
And it's been seminal in my thinking.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.120
And I just believe that reincarnation is

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.520
one of those concepts that is
like plate tectonics.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.160
If you-- at first it's hard to see because

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.960
it's not obvious, but, once you
see it, it changes everything.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.040
It changes so much, it opens
up the horizon of existence.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.610
So we thought this would be a good topic

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.660
to have a shared conversation about
and I'm just real pleased to be here.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.420
Great.
Thanks, Chris.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.640
And I mean,
we'll put the link in afterwards,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.880
but there's some great things,
talks that you've done,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.040
and particularly one which I watched
fairly recently about 'Is there evidence

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.080
for reincarnation?'
And it's so illuminating

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.607
and extraordinary, and kind
of overlooked by so many people.

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:43.600
Tell us some of
the, you know, your story in assembling

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.610
and amassing that, some of that evidence,
or meeting other people that have.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.640
Well, you know, I came from a traditional
religious background,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.280
but over the course of many years
of graduate education I finished

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.060
my doctoral work in philosophy religion,
as an atheistically inclined agnostic.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.460
Basically I'd studied my way
out of religion altogether.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.380
So I started my academic career as a young

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.100
man, a long time ago in 1978,
and I met there the work of two people,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.440
in my first year, and both of them
changed the course of my life.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.660
The first was Ian Stevenson,

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.960
the Carlson Professor at the University
of Virginia, whose lifelong work has been

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.760
to provide carefully documented cases
that clearly-- of young children,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.760
small children who have spontaneous
memories of their previous life.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.340
And then researching these children
from all over the world,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.840
collecting thousands of cases,
publishing hundreds of cases.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.280
And he convinced me that reincarnation
was a simple fact of life.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.400
That's quite a book, isn't it?
That's a big book he's written.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.920
The book.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.120
He's written about, oh,
I think close to a dozen now, but this

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.440
first one was called '20
Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation'.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.860
And, to me, it was a life pivot,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.760
because reincarnation was never
discussed in my graduate education.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.320
It was never discussed in the West
religions, or in the scientific tradition

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.420
that had kind of wiped the slate clean
for-- of the religious traditions.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.140
So I just erased my blackboard and began

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.020
to rethink again the larger questions
of life incorporating reincarnation.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.120
The second person I met at that time was

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.280
Stanislav Grof,
who is the foremost authority

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.880
on integrating psychedelics
into psychotherapy.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.540
And he was providing a methodology
that actually allows one to explore

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.520
the deeper dimensions
of one's own consciousness.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.640
So that began a whole 'nother journey,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.780
a second journey which culminated
eventually in the publication of this book

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.080
Richard mentioned,
'LSD in the Mind of the Universe'.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.240
But today the focus here is
on Ian Stevenson's - what he started

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.640
in the revolution
of really providing carefully documented

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.760
evidence that reincarnation is
just simply a fact of life.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.980
It's not a religious thing.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.660
It's not a-- it's simply a natural
phenomenon that's happening in the world.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.500
And in your talk you gave,
again which the link will be here--

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.160
as a wonderful,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.440
you know, years spent as an academic,
you kind of argue both sides.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.040
So you show how different people have come

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.820
in and even written books to refute those
things, but how they've fallen short.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.320
And so there's this whole story around it.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.200
And there's this growing body of evidence,
that maybe in the last 50 years has been

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.540
documented, I mean it's
fairly recent, isn't it?

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.400
It is recent.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.480
50 years ago, we didn't
have this evidence.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.440
It was still-- reincarnation was

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.680
a speculative topic that the theologians
argued back and forth on.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.420
But now it's moved from the theologians'
table to the psychologists' table.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.740
And now, as we explore more deeply,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.540
the deeper levels of consciousness
in the depth-psychology tradition,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.840
we just find we're bumping into th
ese events over and over again.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.420
Now, the western philosophical tradition,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.540
of course, is kind of still saturated
with the metaphysical position of

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.580
naturalism, which says, 'The only thing
which is real is that which is physical.'

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.680
So, therefore, the brain
produces your mind.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.820
So obviously, in that system,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.780
once your brain dies, your mind 'psss'
[makes sound effect] ceases to exist.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.260
So it's impossible for there to be
something like reincarnation,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:45.020
because it implies a dimension of reality
that's behind the physical world.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.840
If you exist there for any-- consciousness
can exist there for any interval of time

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.940
, between the death of one personality
and the birth of a second personality.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.060
So, naturally, there's been a real push

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.620
back from philosophical
traditions in the West.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.720
Mostly they've just ignored the evidence.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.760
They don't look at it,
and even those who look at it and engage

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.520
it, the foremost critic that I mentioned
in my talk was a man named Paul Edwards,

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.900
a substantial American philosopher,
even in his work - the evidence really

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.880
a careful, dispassionate analysis
of the debate between Ian Stevenson

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.880
on the one hand,
and Paul Edwards on the other hand,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.440
is that he just refuses to look seriously
at the evidence, because he's convinced

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:37.820
beforehand that the evidence must
be somehow faulty, because we know

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.460
that reincarnation can't happen.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:47.319
Yeah, of course, and that's often the way
with academics sometimes, isn't it?

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:50.600
And, you know, a great-- you know, so

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.560
that's, like, that's really
interesting in itself, just the evidence.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.183
And I don't think we need to kind of go
any more into that now but it's--

00:08:59.383 --> 00:08:59.720
I guess

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.300
what are the implications, you know,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.320
if we do-- Because this year I've done
a series of videos myself, short ones,

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.820
just exploring the implications of 'What
if I say yes to this concept,

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.520
and I explore it?' You know,
if I open my mind and my heart to it,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.603
and I begin to really
deeply explore it. You know,

00:09:20.803 --> 00:09:24.140
the implications to our world view,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:29.620
and the way we
move through life is huge, isn't it?

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.380
Yeah.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.000
It all hinges on time.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:40.880
How much time we have. Because if you
have a sense of-- well, let me back up.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.860
I'm a professor.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:47.040
So if I give a quiz in class, I can expect
a certain quality of an answer back.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.520
If I give an exam that takes an hour,
I expect a higher quality of response.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.260
And if it's a take-home research paper, I

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.520
have higher expectations, still,
because they have more time.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.120
So, philosophically, if we believe we only

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.460
live on Earth one time,
and we only have in some cases a few

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:11.520
minutes, to as many as 100 years,
and we extrapolate from that - if there is

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.480
a purpose to existence,
that purpose must be proportionate

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.140
to the amount of time we
have to fulfil that purpose.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:24.020
But if we have a hundred lifetimes,
a thousand lifetimes, in

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.600
which to actualise the purpose
of the universe, then I think it expands

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:34.220
exponentially our potential assessment of
what the purpose of existence might be.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.240
And that's why it's such an important
philosophical discussion,

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:43.640
because once you understand the dynamics
of reincarnation,

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:48.980
once you grasp the fundamental principle,
then it lifts the constriction of time,

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.320
and it allows us to begin to think
in terms of,

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:58.480
and appreciate and understand,
the larger patterns of the pulse of cause

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.340
and effect overarching
over centuries of time.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.440
And it just elevates the whole discussion.
Absolutely.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.060
And I think, like-- you know, if I can be
blunt, like, if

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:17.020
you have an inherent sense of a divinity
behind creation, then

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:24.420
it seems logical to extend that into,
you know, that this concept of generosity.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:30.480
Because if you had a divinity and you only
have one life, it's very stingy, it seems.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.900
Like, it doesn't seem to have any
kind of pattern or reason to it.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.540
You know, it's like, for me,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:44.000
life is just-- spirit is just filled
with generosity in terms of time.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:50.900
And if we kind of open to the eternal
nature of life,

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:56.760
then of course that would make sense, for
there to be a continuity of consciousness.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.920
And I think that, you know,
the more people open to this,

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:06.920
the more they kind of realise it
has some deep root inside them.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.660
You know, I

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.880
discovered that a lot because I've
begun to talk about it more and more.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.920
And one of the things I realised is no one
else really much-- other than people

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:21.200
who are doing past-life regression
therapeutically, a lot of the teachers

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:26.220
and spiritual teachers in the world
today avoid this subject.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:31.640
I mean, I don't know if they consciously
avoid it, but they don't talk about it.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.620
I mean, they get asked questions,
but then their answers are

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:40.400
kind of generally quite short,
and it doesn't get picked up.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.880
So, yeah, I'm really interested
in something that is passed over that is

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:53.440
so obvious, and it should be
in plain view for all of us.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.160
Isn't that curious? I mean,
I understand why my colleagues

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.900
at the University who tended to be
you know materialists and reductionists.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.700
That I understand.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.820
But why spiritual teachers
wouldn't talk about it?

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.160
Or wouldn't use it to sort of frame

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:15.940
a larger and expanded horizon? Sometimes
I've heard people say, 'Well,

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.040
it can dilute your intensity
of commitments for realisation

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.480
in the present.' But, you know,
if you think you have many lifetimes

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.020
and you're not going to take
this lifetime as seriously.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.020
But I think that

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.340
argument kind of evaporates quickly
once you look at it carefully.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:40.020
I think it deepens the textures of the
situations in which we find ourselves in.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.320
And let me just give you one example.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.760
Some of the research,
Michael Newton's research, for example,

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:52.500
in his book 'Journeys of the Soul' and
'Destiny of Souls', he and other past life

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:57.720
therapists have found evidence
that we choose our incarnation.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.560
Now, I think in some ways many people

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.800
don't, they may kind of go very
haphazardly and take what's available,

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.020
but as you get mature,
you choose your incarnation carefully.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.200
Now, if we choose our

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.040
incarnation carefully,
when there was a time when we knew more

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:21.340
than we know now, and we could see more
than we could see now,

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.960
if we chose the life that we're living
now, with all of its ups and downs

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.800
and challenges and opportunities,
then doesn't that change how we might

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:35.220
relate to those very circumstances
in which we find ourselves?

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.760
You know, not to go chasing
all sorts of hidden

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.900
mission-- you know, hidden meanings,
but to basically temper the quality

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:49.600
of the self-responsibility that we use
in how we engage the people that we're

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.420
with, the circumstances
that we find ourselves in.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.160
Yeah.
And doesn't it make you also-- I mean,

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:03.800
for me, it makes me feel more like
a kind of eternal, cosmic adventurer.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.820
So, you know, it enrichens
this time I'm in now.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.680
It actually, in
many ways it focuses me a lot more

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:17.080
into the present, because I'm not worrying
about dying, if you know what I mean.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.120
It changes that.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.240
And it's not just a concept.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.480
You know, have to go-- you know, this is

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:27.340
my understanding, through my teaching,
is you have to contemplate something very

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:31.300
deeply like this, for it to start
to kind of take root in you.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.720
And then as it takes root in you,

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.580
it brings out of your-- literally,
I feel the truth of it is in our DNA.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.000
It's, like, in us.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:46.360
So once that gets triggered,
that kind of awakening of the memory,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.040
it-- there's a sort of certainty

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:55.340
and a stability that grows inside us,
that enables us to handle

00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:00.980
whatever challenges come to us in a really
much more powerful way,

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:08.120
because we're rooted in this kind
of eternal acceptance of this.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:12.840
You know, you hear
it all the time, on people on the radio. I

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.760
heard last week, like, someone just
saying, 'Well, you've only got one life.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.520
So you've got to, you know, really make
the most of it.' Which is a great thing to

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.980
say, but it's also, you
have only got one life.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:28.820
It's just, I
keep coming back to, that's really a tight

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.220
kind of reality from whichever belief
system you're operating out of.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.160
Cuts the legs right out from under you.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.840
Because correlating with that is usually
the ideas of: you exist and the universe

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:49.260
is being driven by blind chance,
it's just random mutation, there's no

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.640
existential significance
to the circumstances in which you find

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:57.120
yourself in, so you only get one shot,
make the best of it,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.700
but then when you die, it's gone,
you're gone anyway, so who cares?

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.880
And that's just such a demeaning

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:09.400
and counterintuitive
philosophy of life. Because I think when

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.810
we look at the beauties of nature,
when we look at the night sky,

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:19.050
when we see the pictures from the Hubble
telescope of the magnificent patterns

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:24.280
in the deep cosmos, when we look around us
at Earth and look at the depth

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:30.560
of the emergence of life and the emergence
of self-awareness on the planet over time,

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.180
all these projects take place
over enormous sweeps of time.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:41.400
And we are the first generation to really
appreciate how much time the universe has

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.680
had to be evolving
into the form that it is.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:49.560
Now, if the universe and everything it's
doing takes enormous amounts of time

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:55.330
and we only have one life,
then existentially, we're cut off.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.900
We're not-- we don't participate
in that massive project.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.040
But if we do part-- if we live multiple

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.440
lifetimes, there's a good
news - bad news situation.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.900
You know, the bad news is, you know, well,

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:16.800
it's hard work in this lifetime, and we'd
like to have it over with when we die.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.530
But if we keep coming back, you know,
there's a larger project afoot.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.800
You know, it's not a simple grade,
like we thought it was before.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.530
It's a whole university education.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.240
The good news is you're right.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.900
It drops away, the fear
of death drops away.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.420
I mean, it just drops away.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.120
The good news is it allows us to envision

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:41.880
a deeper-- to feel into the deeper
currents of life and the deeper projects.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:46.280
And it allows us to begin to think
in terms of longer term projects.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:51.280
And I think this is one of the things you
see when people take to heart this idea,

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.760
even without specific knowledge
of their former lives.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.700
I mean, that's interesting.
And that can be helpful.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.200
But even without that,
when you really let that in, and you look

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:06.760
around you and you realise that every
person you're seeing has been here before

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:14.640
and will be here again, it just allows
you to engage life with so much more

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.506
meaning and intensity of the process.

00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:22.640
You know,
what we are good at are things we have

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.440
practised in the past,
things that we are just getting started

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.810
on are things will get
better at in the future.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.330
And we can think we have that much time.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.810
We can think in terms
of that larger landscape.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.900
Yeah and of course,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.220
you know, we're not-- you know, there are

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:45.920
many great thinkers and philosophers
and sages who have come to the same

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:51.740
conclusion about rebirth. And
notably among them in the West,

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.480
because we can talk a little
bit about the Eastern views.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.940
It's pretty common in the East.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:04.010
But Jung is someone who obviously springs,
like, straight up into the centre

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.080
fray, because he's a bit
more contemporary.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.290
And,

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.980
you know, he's been this pillar of modern
psychology, in the way in which we now

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:17.120
understand the unconscious, and
the collective unconscious, and mythology,

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:22.050
and all these other transformational
kind of consciousness views.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.180
But he tended to hide his
belief in reincarnation.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:29.760
You know, he came to it kind of late
in life, and he began to hide it because

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.480
he had pushed the boundaries so much
he was concerned about the backlash.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.400
But it's there in his work.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.280
And I think that's what
happens with a lot of people.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.160
I think they go 'Well,

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:44.810
I'm not sure I want to go into that area'
because it's got a stigma attached to it.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.640
And it really has, hasn't it? Because

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.960
the moment you say the word reincarnation,
you've got like a-- there's a whole kind

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:57.200
of battery of sceptics coming at you.
Whether they're coming from Christianity

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.530
or whether they're coming from, you know,
materialist science.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:07.200
You know, it's like you really put your
head above the parapet.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.600
For years, for decades,

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.960
I was taking students into the
literature on reincarnation.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.760
And it's like you just-- once you put all

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.360
that aside and you just look at the cases,
you just look the evidence.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.620
I mean, I found 95 percent of my students

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:29.440
were able to overcome all kinds
of resistances, both secular and religious

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.560
resistance, because they're trained
in our culture to follow the evidence.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.880
Once they saw the evidence and how
consistent it was, and how it appeared

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:43.740
in so many contexts,
spontaneous memories, evoked memories.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.320
Theyjust-- they accepted it.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:51.500
Once they accepted it, it was a life
-changing event in many of their lives.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.380
Do you have any favourite stories that you

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.600
remember of those recurrences,
because it's not--

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.480
I have so many.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.400
The one I opened the book with 'Life
Cycles', the one I start in the opening

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:09.420
pages, is a case of a young
girl named Romy Crees.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.480
And Romy was born
to Catholic parents in Iowa.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.680
So it's like, it's okay if they
want to reincarnate in India.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.520
That's their business.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:21.260
But everybody knows Iowan Catholics
do not reincarnate.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:25.720
But she had spontaneous memories of having

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.240
been a man, Joe Williams,
in a previous life.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.440
She remembers being married.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:35.240
She remembers three children,
having three children, their names.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.360
She remembered dying in a motorcycle

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.120
accident, and she had
a phobia of motorcycles.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:48.440
And long story short, researchers got
to her eventually and brought her

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:52.920
to the town where she had remembered
living as Joe Williams.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:57.920
And she was able to remember--
identify the mother of Joe Williams.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:03.600
She insisted that they pick up blue
flowers on the way to the house because

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:08.180
she said, Those are the flowers that she
likes, and that turned out to be true.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.360
She was able to identify from pictures

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:16.480
who the people were in Joe Williams's
life, the players of their life.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:23.480
And she developed a deep emotional bond
to Williams's mother, who was alive.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.090
And his wife named Sheila.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.360
He had been married.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.383
She had been married to-- Joe
had been married to Sheila.

00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:33.220
They were--did have three children.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.560
Sheila and Joe were killed
in a motorcycle accident.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.640
So this has-- goes on, and on, and
on. I've read hundreds of these cases.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.800
And there's so many of them, yeah.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:46.980
So many. These children remember very
intimate details of family history.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:52.500
They remember-- they know the architecture
inside homes that they've never been in.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.640
They can walk around a town that they've

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.640
never been in and they
know their way around.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:02.680
They remember the personalities
from the previous person's life.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:07.560
And they remember arguments
that they had with neighbours,

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:14.220
incidents that came up in-- Like the time
a child, when they were having a birthday

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:20.261
party for their child - that a neighbour's
dog bit one of the children in the party.

00:24:20.461 --> 00:24:24.840
Very, very-- things that are
-- just don't make the public news.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.120
Little details.
It's the little details, isn't it?

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.240
There's one I've read that I loved.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.320
I can't remember exactly.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:37.740
But I remember a reincarnated
memory of-- in a Muslim family.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:41.800
And they took the little girl, I think it
was a little girl, into the family.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.520
And the women were the veiled,
completely veiled.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:50.920
And she identified from looking at them,
from seeing their body language,

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.260
without seeing their faces or
anything, she could name them.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:25:00.620
And that was like, wow,
that's how deep this kind of detail goes.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.480
Yeah.
Yeah it's fun to explore those things.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:08.760
And I-- you know,
I recommend to people that you just take

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.280
a look at some of the evidence,
because it's very-- I find it very

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:17.620
affirming. You know, sort of like, it's
difficult to refute that level of detail.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.440
And I don't know, you can come up with--

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.280
I'm sure a good cynic can
come up with all kinds of--

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.940
Well, here's one for the cynics.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.900
This is one of Ian Stevenson's cases.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:34.180
They brought this boy back into the life
circumstances of the previous personality.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:40.040
And the wife of the previous personality
said, 'Okay, if you're my husband,

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.640
where did you put the will? After you
died, we looked all over for the will.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.080
We couldn't find it.' The little boy walks

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.320
over to a floorboard in the kitchen,
picks up a board,

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:55.520
reaches down and underneath
the floor and pulls up the will.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.660
Isn't that something?

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:01.000
How many of those cases do you read before

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.560
you begin to understand,
this is just happening.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.560
It's just part of the rhythm of life.
Totally.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.960
It is extraordinary.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.200
And also it has-- there's a whole load

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:16.810
of documentation about marks on the body,
isn't there? You know people

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.020
that have marks on the body
that relate to previous events.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.840
Or you know-- I don't think we need to go

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:28.050
down that route, but it's another whole
area of documentation.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.400
That was Ian Stevenson's last work.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:35.140
And if you do want to go down that area,
you can read his

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:40.620
two volume, thousand page book
on reincarnation and biology,

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:46.480
which he studies 187 cases
with medical documentation.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.460
Really rigorous, isn't it?
Rigorous, very, very rigorous.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:54.160
And what we find is that the death wounds,

00:26:54.190 --> 00:27:00.090
the wounds associated with death
in the previous personality show up as

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.220
birthmarks or scars
in the subsequent personality.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.940
But this is suggesting not only do our

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:12.540
-- does our mind influence subsequent
mind, but even our body,

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.740
our mind's experience in the body can
influence the formation of tissue

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:22.140
in our subsequent body. And that of
course just deepens the story.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.040
Absolutely.
And that's why I wanted to bring it up,

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.330
because that's what leads
into the therapeutic work, doesn't it?

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.420
Because, if you open to this idea then--

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.600
I mean I'm just thinking of all the people
out there who have difficulties,

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.600
maybe in their health,
or maybe in their relationships,

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:42.120
or maybe addictions,
or you know whatever we're facing in life,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:48.290
or just things that they've-- complexes
that they find really hard to overcome.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.040
And if we understand that those things may

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:58.540
have a root in a previous lifetime
and that was something unfinished or

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:02.800
incomplete, then it can open up
a whole therapeutic journey for us.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:08.160
And that's what this whole therapeutic
community has evolved, out of this.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.620
The past life therapy community,

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.440
basically, there are any number
of therapists who've said something

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:17.800
to the effect of this:
If you put someone into a relaxed,

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:21.840
inward-focused state,
a hypnotic state but people have a lot

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.520
of misunderstandings of what hypnosis--
but just relaxed inward-focused state,

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:30.800
and you invite them to go to the source
of the problem that your-- they've come

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:36.040
to therapy to address,
about 35-40 percent of them will go back

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.200
to something in their present life. It'll
come back to something that happened

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.980
in their childhood or
something in their infancy.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:47.040
But a significant 50-60 percent of people

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.360
will go back to something that's
rooted in a previous lifetime.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.050
And when they

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:58.260
consciously remember that previous
lifetime, and they consciously

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:03.240
re-appropriate the trauma that they
weren't able to fully internalise

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:09.120
and address in that lifetime,
particularly death could-- circumstances

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.080
surrounding their death,
when they are able to consciously remember

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:18.020
and assimilate it into their present
consciousness, then

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:23.760
consistently, over and over again,
underlying psychological problems and even

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:28.560
physical problems begin to loosen
their grip on us and untie the knots.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.020
So [inaudible] a greater depth.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:37.330
Because they have these roots deep in the
collective unconscious, you know, and

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.080
we're going into the collective

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.900
unconscious to find them
and pull them out. So that's--

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.700
Well,

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.720
let's be a little careful here because
collective unconscious,

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:53.020
in a Jungian kind of usage refers
to the unconscious of the entire species.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.290
So let's maybe call a soul consciousness,

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.920
which is the collective unconscious
of the individual through time.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:06.200
I got a good question for you, which is,

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:14.720
I have a really dear friend, and he is a
kind of startling intellect. He's in his

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:21.460
late seventies now and really,
really intelligent, very spiritual man.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.180
And yet he has a difficulty
with reincarnation.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:30.980
And we have wonderful discussions around
it, in the past, and his

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:36.600
kind of-- his very sophisticated spiritual
intellect, you know,

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.760
where it goes is-- and I think others may
come from this direction as well,

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:45.840
that's why I'm saying it, is that,
you know, you really

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.400
want, you know, you want to believe it.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.290
Everyone wants to believe
in the continuity of our existence.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.640
And yet

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.280
the great Advaita teachers or whatever,

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:02.480
they would talk about the surrender
of the individual ego

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.600
into the higher-- you know into the-- back
into the ocean of being.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:10.480
And that's something that you have
to undergo in order to attain liberation.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.960
And so

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.720
there is this very strong spiritual kind

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:21.260
of-- I think we've referred
to it as 'up and out'

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:25.560
kind of cosmology,
where you know there-- we are here

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:32.640
to escape this, this cycle,
this samsaric cycle. And

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.570
that-- you know, so that we
can attain this liberation.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.040
And we attain it within this lifetime,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:42.480
in a body, or we may attain it,
you know, afterwards.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:49.020
So that's another whole
kind of interesting area there, isn't it?

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:53.160
Yeah, simply because there are cultures
who have believed in reincarnation

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:58.720
for thousands of years, and have developed
a certain understanding of it in their

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.400
culture, doesn't mean
that they've got it right.

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.040
And I think that reincarnation is one

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:09.560
of those ideas that
simply, once we begin to see the evidence,

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:15.080
then it begins to deepen a line of enquiry.
Which I-- for me personally,

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:20.420
I think is-- I've revised dramatically
the understanding I had of reincarnation

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:23.280
borrowed from Eastern traditions,
Eastern cultures.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.980
And one of the traditions has to do

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.660
with this larger question:
Where does reincarnation go?

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.840
Where is it taking us?

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.460
What's the endgame of reincarnation?

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.880
And you're right.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:35.940
All the cultures,

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:40.440
all the religions of the Axial age - it
came into existence three to 5000 years

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:46.140
ago - all of them teach of a cosmological
journey that's an up-and-out cosmology.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.500
So there is a sense
that we're trapped here.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.140
This is not as good as spiritual reality.

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:56.280
We want to develop either in one lifetime,

00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:00.080
if it's a Christian salvation,
salvation by grace,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.680
you know, or multiple lifetimes to achieve
samsara-- excuse me, acheive moksha.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.440
Which is escape from samsara,
escape from the physical world.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.260
We achieve some type of enlightenment

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:17.180
condition, which is the passport that
allows us to leave and not come back.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:23.420
And all of these traditions are
basically about escape.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.860
And that leaves unanswered the fundamental

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:30.440
question - what is the purpose
of physical existence in the first place?

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.760
And now that we have a deeper

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:36.840
understanding of how many billions
of years of genius have gone

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:42.570
into the manifestation of the physical
world - it's not a very satisfactory

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.240
conclusion to think that just within

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:50.620
five-- we only became conscious of these
deeper dimensions about 5000 years ago.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:55.090
As soon as we become self-conscious
of the level of consciousness which we

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.840
share with all other
beings and all existence.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:02.660
As soon as we become aware of that and can
live our life from that centre,

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:07.360
then the purpose of existence is
to escape the entire physical world?

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:11.600
And I don't think that's really true.

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.100
And it's a little bit rooted in
that kind of slightly self-denial

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:23.040
philosophy, isn't it? That, you know,
that also is many thousands of years old.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.460
Yeah.

00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:26.800
I think that basically all the Axial

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.520
religions got two things
fundamentally wrong.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.210
They've got many things right,
but they got two things wrong.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.260
They got nature wrong.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:38.320
They don't really have an adequate
theology or understanding of nature.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.840
And they got women wrong.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:44.420
And the two are connected because
women are closely connected to nature.

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:48.880
And they're patriarchally-oriented
and they're escapist-oriented.

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:53.650
And I think it makes-- as
an historian, I understand it.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:57.500
I think about four or 5000 years ago,

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:02.780
through various psycho-technologies:
either yoga, or meditation,

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.680
or psychedelic substances,
we began to have a deeper experience

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:11.800
of the mother universe, of this universe
that surrounds the physical universe.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.440
Once you have experiential contact

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:21.080
with that universe, it is so blissful, it
is so ecstatic-soaked that you cannot

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.160
help-- and you recognise
that that's where we're from.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.960
You cannot help believe
that that's where we belong.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:29.650
This is not where we belong,
that's where we belong.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.000
And they develop a theology of return.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.720
So the Saviour comes to take us home.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.120
The enlightened being comes
to liberate us back into our home.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.400
But that still leaves the question,
what is the purpose of creation?

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:46.210
And I think what we're beginning
to understand now,

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.560
as our experience of this mother universe
is deepened over time,

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:54.520
and our understanding of the physical
universe has deepened over time,

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:58.960
is that we're not here to achieve
escape velocity and leave.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.880
We're here to incarnate more, and more,

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:07.920
and more of spiritual reality and capacity
inside our physical being, so that we can

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:13.690
truly live and create heaven
on Earth, to wake up and stay.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.820
And not just to wake up as an individual,

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:20.460
but to wake up as an entire
species and stay.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:22.440
Now that-- you can't leave that.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.480
I mean we're going to discuss
that more aren't we.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.460
We're going to come back to that, yeah.

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.440
But that's a huge

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.560
window to open up.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.440
It's this-- you know, and you've
touched on a lot of themes there,

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.720
particularly,
you know, the thing about the feminine,

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.170
the physical body.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.320
You know, that's what I think I interpret

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:51.840
partly what you're saying as well is
that those religions didn't really

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.300
understand the physical body,
as you said, nature.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.620
Didn't value it.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:01.020
Because there's vast beauty
in this physicality.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:07.920
And it's perhaps-- what we're exploring
is perhaps it's here to be spiritualised.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.400
Perhaps it's here--

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.440
you know perhaps that's why we're here,
to bring that ecstatic realisation,

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:18.760
deeper, and deeper, and
deeper into the form.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.880
Because, you know, if we see that that's

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:25.369
our highest purpose,
we no longer want to leave.

00:37:25.569 --> 00:37:29.620
That's-- then our role is,
through subsequent incarnations,

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:34.240
to bring more and more
of that light down into the Earth.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.294
And then we're also taking full
responsibility for the body and the Earth.

00:37:39.494 --> 00:37:43.260
You know which is something
we also haven't done very well.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.100
Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.960
And if that first-- sounds at first

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:51.600
disappointing, where we would say, 'Oh,
no, I want heaven, please.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.500
Thank you very much.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.680
I don't want, you know, a
transformed body here. Because here is

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:01.120
still too difficult.' I think
we may be underestimating

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.560
how--

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.500
but we may be underestimating what is
possible. And just what it would really

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:14.480
feel like to live a truly fully
-spiritualised, enlightened existence.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:21.360
And here I think we can look at some
of the God-soaked masters of history.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.951
Who are truly living in the
God-soaked condition, or the,

00:38:27.151 --> 00:38:33.760
you know, a primordial condition
that is radically open to the vast mind

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:37.920
of the universe, inside their body,
inside time and space.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.040
And what we're seeing from these

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:47.080
Mahasiddhas, these great beings, is that
they can do what we would call miracles.

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.829
Because there is so much spiritual power
concentrated in their presence,

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:56.680
that the-- it is as if the laws of
nature operate differently around them.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:04.260
And they're showing us a prototype of what
each of us is in the process of becoming.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:10.540
And, therefore, if we imagine what it
would be like to have an entire species

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.640
kind of living in that kind
of presence then, what a planet!

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.200
Yeah and our physics is also pushing
us in that direction, isn't it?

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:25.320
To the understandings that we are
entangled with nature, with the universe.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:32.920
And that-- and my old teachings is
based on this notion that in our DNA are

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:40.460
contained these sleeping, dormant codes,
these Siddhis, as I call them, 64

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.380
Siddhis. And like you were you're
talking about,

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:46.380
they're an activation inside us that

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:51.520
is waiting for its moment so that we can
enter more fully into the next phase

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.640
of our evolution, of the magical
universe, the quantum universe.

00:39:54.670 --> 00:40:00.600
You know, where our thoughts and our
feelings and our sensations are actually

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.300
travelling kind of outside
our physical body.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.130
You know, they're entangled with nature.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.500
So nature then responds with us, to us,

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:15.300
which perhaps it already does
at a level that we're not aware of.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:22.520
So it's just about opening up those
pathways, you know, those literal pathways

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:26.940
in our being, into that next
phase of our evolution.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:32.280
We are already plugged into nature, very,
very deep levels down to the quantum level

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:37.280
in the unified field. We're plugged
into our ecosystems and the subtle,

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:41.800
intimate feedback. We're plugged into each
other, our minds wash back and forth.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.020
We're already there.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:47.860
But when we can become conscious of those
connections, when we can

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:53.711
sort of lift off the obstructive shadows
that are carry-overs from other,

00:40:53.911 --> 00:40:57.060
sadder times,
then that connection becomes

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:01.340
-- begins to rise, and it empowers
a conscious participation.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.100
And it makes what was
unconscious, conscious.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:12.000
And then existence becomes more enlivened,
I think, and enlivened

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:16.320
with the synchronicities
that sort of indicate the broader

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:21.580
intelligence that's a-- you know,
that's alive in life around us.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.040
Yeah.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.320
Yeah I'm sure that you know-- I'd love it

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:31.080
if we could bring our conversation also
into sort of-- into people's lives

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:35.060
a little bit, so that they can consider
their relationships and-- you know

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:42.300
from this perspective, and how that might
change one's attitudes or views

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:46.800
towards difficult relationships,
or towards, you know, what's

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:54.640
the afflictions that come up in us
and that we have to handle in our everyday

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.440
life. It really changes
all of that, doesn't it?

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.640
Because then you look at life and it's

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:06.740
actually a process of the opening
of the heart, which the teachers have

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:12.260
always said. It's like every relationship,
it's purpose is to show us some grace.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.100
And I call this, this Law of Unseen Grace.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:21.080
You know, where every relationship that
shows up is offering us some-- you know

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.400
particularly the difficult ones,

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:27.000
is offering us some
incredible teaching, some

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.840
virtue that we haven't yet polished.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:32.760
Whether it's forgiveness, or whether it's

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.130
some, you know, clarity,
or whether it's-- you know, whatever it

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:42.480
is, it's just some form of love
that we are here to learn from those

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:48.980
relationships, because they have--
they come as part of our teaching-karma.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:53.580
You know, I always see it like, the
ancients called it-- this life a Lila.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.940
And I always see these-- a game,
a drama or a theatre.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.020
And, it's almost like, before you come in,

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.840
you're given this little envelope,
and in there, you open up the envelope

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:05.900
and in there is like,
'Okay, here's your script

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.130
and here are-- ' and there's going
to be some things that show up.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.440
And these are the things you're going

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:13.480
to learn this-- you know, you've
chosen it at some level.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:21.500
And so that changes the way that we
kind of see it-- behave, doesn't it?

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.500
Yeah.
I think so.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.650
I'm sure if you had personal experience

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.280
of that in your life, in your
emotional life, I mean that's--

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:34.160
Yeah.
And one little-- one more step.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.820
It's not simply the envelope
that was given you.

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.580
But you were given

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:44.760
three envelopes and you chose the one
that you felt was most suited for your

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:47.660
evolution at this particular
point in history.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:52.960
And so it's your choice
to engage these challenges.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:54.760
And

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.800
yeah-- and when we engage our life

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.740
in that way,
it's taking full responsibility

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:04.440
for the circumstances
in which we find ourselves in.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:10.560
It allows us to engage the challenges
with more patience,

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:14.740
and with more dedication,
and with more of the long term.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:17.120
Because we know we're not-- if this is

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.240
something that if we don't deal with it
now, it's not going to go away.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.040
It's just going to come
back in another form.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.180
So let's get it done now.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.940
Let's deal with it now.

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:29.174
And it also allows you to build on things,

00:44:29.374 --> 00:44:34.480
because I think
our understanding of reincarnation is

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:38.980
being very informed by the therapists
working heroically in past-life therapy.

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:41.280
But if you only pay attention to those

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:45.680
cases, it can tend to create
an understanding of reincarnation that is

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.960
tilted towards failures
coming forward that we--

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:50.760
Traumas.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.140
Traumas, yeah.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.320
But just like the school system around us
has many faults,

00:44:56.350 --> 00:45:00.740
but most of the kids learn and most
of the kids pass every year.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:06.440
And I think most people rise to the karma,
the challenge of their life.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.760
And that means every lifetime we're not

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.210
simply dealing with leftover
issues from the past.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.400
We're building on assets, we're spending

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.640
assets, and investing in greater
fruition in the future.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:23.900
And so it helps us handle
the challenging circumstances.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.620
But it also helps us embrace

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:31.760
the positive circumstances of our life,
the hidden talent which comes forward

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:37.980
unannounced, the partnership which emerges
that we can feel such a deep kinship

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:42.920
with this person, that we can go
forward and do something new with.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.780
Yeah.

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:53.540
And you kind of triggered a memory of mine
about-- from Sri Aurobindo, you know,

00:45:53.570 --> 00:46:01.960
who spoke incredibly clearly
with his penetrating mind about

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:06.820
the complexity of karma,
and how we-- you know, because we

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:10.660
probably need to sort of probably discuss
karma a little bit, and how

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:15.240
we misunderstand it so easily
by trying to oversimplify it.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.040
And, actually,

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:24.240
when you look at the universe with all its
multiple dimensions and the quantum field,

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:29.740
and there's these force fields
operating at different levels.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:32.760
But there's this karmic force that's

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:38.760
equalising and balancing, or
that has a tendency towards balance,

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:43.760
we could say, and it's-- and allowing us
to go through this educational process.

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:46.460
But everything at different levels is

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:51.820
influenced by these strands
of the karmic force.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:54.520
And that karmic force seems to have-- it's

00:46:54.550 --> 00:47:00.460
like the idea I said about unseen grace,
if you are able to fully embrace it

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:05.960
in your life, then you get a grace
through going-- through unwrapping it.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.140
But you've got to kind of have the courage

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:13.700
face it fully, and really take it
in and let it-- you know,

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:18.640
whatever the suffering is,
transform it, transmute it.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:21.420
So it doesn't-- transmutation of karma

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:27.120
play a huge part in this
reincarnative theology.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:29.340
If we just look around us.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.320
It's the web of cause and effect.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.320
Everything is cause and effect.

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.280
We live in a continuous web of cause

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.940
and effect. The air we breathe,
the weather patterns, our biology,

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:43.720
what we ate, the purity of what we ate,
everything is this flow of cause

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:47.260
and effect, the universe, the movement
of the planets, the solar system.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:49.680
We live in a continuous web of cause

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:55.920
and effect. And
here we're simply focusing on that portion

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:59.340
of the web of cause and effect,
which influences the

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:03.200
human-- the development of the soul,
influences our human psychophysical

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:07.820
development, which is a subset
of this much larger cause and effect.

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:10.060
And, in that context,

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:18.780
I think we've had a tendency, I think, to
narrow our discussion of Karma.

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:21.080
Usually, many of the teachers will talk

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:25.420
about karma, and they're only talking
about that portion of the karma,

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:30.280
which immediately impinges upon our
spiritual maturity. Where they were making

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.340
progress, becoming a more
spiritually mature person.

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:39.440
But a lot of karma, probably the bulk of
karma, is just amoral cause and effect.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:41.680
You have a habit, you practise something,

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:45.000
it becomes a skill, that skill
carries over into another life.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:49.560
You have an automobile accident,
you develop a trauma of a particular

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:52.400
circumstance, that carries
over into another life.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:56.800
It's not necessarily
about your spiritual development.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:00.140
It's just cause and effect.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.440
Yeah, circumstantial.
Yeah.

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.560
And so when-- as you open up

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:06.440
to the conditioning,
that's kind of etching itself in your

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:10.700
life, and you lift it out,
engage it, lift it out.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:14.700
Then that-- the well-spring
of your life becomes freer.

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:15.800
It becomes clearer.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:17.760
And

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.340
you're not stepping out of the web

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:24.020
of cause and effect,
but you're stepping into a greater freedom

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:27.520
within the web-work of cause
and effect that surrounds you.

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:33.420
You have greater capacity to make
increasingly free choices.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.960
Greater capacity to choose.

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:38.620
Ask yourself, 'Well, what do I want?

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:44.780
What would I like to have?'
Instead of a compulsion of,

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.800
you know, grabbing.

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.080
You know, it's tempting,

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:52.400
isn't it? For some people to kind of say,
'Well, karma and reincarnation,' then

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.720
there's this sort of like, 'Well,
that person over there was born disabled.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.240
Does that mean they've done something
terrible in their last life?' And there's

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:01.740
that whole
real sort of oversimplification--

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:08.160
Over, yeah.
Of a very complex kind of arena where

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.340
-- you know, we don't-- unless you can
plug right into the soul-quality

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:18.960
inside that person, inside that being,
you don't really know

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.600
what-- you know, they could be that hidden
Saint that has deliberately taken

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:30.760
on that incredibly challenging role,
to polish one particular virtue,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.740
you know, or skill,

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.169
over the period of one lifetime.

00:50:35.369 --> 00:50:38.720
And equally I guess, like,
very short incarnations.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.740
That's-- I don't think you and I talked
about those, but I'd love to hear what you

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.540
-- you know, like a child that comes
in for a very short time and then leaves.

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:51.660
That also has implications for
the healing of the whole, doesn't it?

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.200
Because why does a child come

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.920
in for a short time,
or a baby is born very-- for a very short

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.880
period of time and then
there's-- leaves this grief behind it.

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:03.980
But then there's this feeling that it's
also still part of your life.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.400
Yeah.

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.720
Let's explore that, I mean we haven't-- we
can go and--

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.720
We haven't talked about that, yeah.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.480
You know it's a-- we can recognise
the principle of cause and effect.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.420
We can recognise the principle
of karma-vipaka, cause and effect.

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:25.480
But then we can get-- so many
teachers I think sometimes get

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:30.000
-- or all of us, we think we
can determine cause and effect.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.960
We think we can understand it when really

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:34.680
we're just touching the wrapping
on the package.

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:39.180
We're just really touching the surface,
and the safest position I think really is

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:42.100
recognise that we're looking
at a deep, deep mystery here.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:45.620
And you're-- it would be foolish to try

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:51.740
to judge anybody's karma that's
just a-- that's a wasted exercise.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:56.020
Better to stick with the karma that you
can penetrate within your own life.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:52:00.720
And you're right, because we don't know,
we really don't know what's happening when

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:04.740
we see cause and effect
operating around us.

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:07.360
When you-- I would tell my students,

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:13.940
when you see great suffering,
you're either seeing a sinner or a Saint.

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:18.320
And you can never know which it is,
so best not to make any judgments at all.

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.920
And I think there are many hidden Saints,

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:27.520
many more hidden Saints who are
taking on a lot of cause and effect,

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:34.000
either from their own larger soul stream,
or from even a collective soul stream.

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:36.960
So they're actually focusing in their

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:42.820
body, in their psyche,
what we might call negative karma,

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:47.100
negative cause and effect,
for the uplift of the whole.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:53.040
And that type of generosity
and compassion, we see it around us all

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.560
the time in good parents,
and good mothers, and good fathers.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.680
They would be-- do anything
for their children.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:03.210
And I think souls
at that deeper level do that too.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.720
So we can't judge.

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:08.980
We really just
couldn't judge, it's a waste of effort.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:10.320
No. I read this book.

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.840
I think I told you about this book, and

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:17.980
anyone-- it's a recommendation called
'Sand Talk', and it's by

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:25.060
an Aboriginal from Australia, or part
-Aboriginal, and really intelligent man.

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:28.520
And he tells the story of when he went

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:37.340
to talk to one of the elders about,
you know, the problems of, you know, the

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:41.420
indigenous people,
particularly the men who had kind of

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:45.260
just got-- gone down the role
of alcoholic, the way of alcoholism.

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:47.760
And were eating really terrible food, and,

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.560
like, were overweight and obese,
and these terrible problems.

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:52.600
And he was, like, really concerned about

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:57.210
them, and the old elder just said,
'Yeah, they're the warriors.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:02.760
You know, they are taking on the karmic,
you know they are warrior spirits in our

00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:08.240
tribe, in our lineage. And they're holding
this kind of negativity in their bodies.

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:11.120
And one day they will

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.500
become-- they will move
from warrior to healer.

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:14.660
And that's the path.

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:17.308
That's the kind of evolutionary pathway.'

00:54:17.508 --> 00:54:20.500
But it was a beautiful,
it really, like, it really

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:25.180
stuck with this young man as he was
exploring like, 'Wow,' that's a really

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:30.100
kind of powerful, empowering
way to see someone

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:33.997
dealing with, like, a cultural problem.

00:54:34.197 --> 00:54:38.460
You know or a societal,
you know, difficulty

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:40.987
that's more collective,
you know, that we see a lot.

00:54:41.187 --> 00:54:44.520
You know, collective
karma is a-- you know, we're touching on here as well.

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.040
Yeah, it's a very, very deep-- those deep
currents that run underneath,

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:56.370
that requires us to open to a much deeper,
expanded spiritual story. And

00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:03.020
because we often think of reincarnation
and karma in a very individualistic,

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:08.760
atomistic fashion where we're-- you know,
the individual soul is evolving themselves

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:13.380
over the skilful use of choice
in the context of karma.

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:20.366
And if we start to sink into a larger
understanding, a deeper understanding,

00:55:20.566 --> 00:55:27.780
then we recognise that each individual
is a fractal point within a unified field.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:32.260
And that there's a-- these deep currents
that are running within

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:37.210
the unconscious of humanity, or the
soul-field of humanity,

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:42.000
and that we are all players
on a larger evolutionary dynamic.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:48.940
Then it just opens up a deeper
understanding of what's taking place here.

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:51.260
And I know that we've sort of tagged this

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:56.700
for one of our topics for our
second discussion, but it's-- yeah.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:59.920
Well we'll plant the seed now.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:08.360
When you go into that kind of world view,
the perfection of the choreography of what

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:12.040
you're explaining is just
mind blowing, isn't it?

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:17.240
It's mind blowing in terms
of the interconnectivity of soul groups,

00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:20.520
and these fractals,
and these patternings of humans.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.880
And

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:26.580
this is why one of the great insights
that I got from your

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:30.840
uni-- 'Mind of the Universe' book,
because you describe this really well.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.000
It's a paradox, I think.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:34.740
And maybe it's one of the last things we

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:40.500
can just discuss here today because it's
so important, I find, and it's the paradox

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:46.580
of being an individual soul and yet
being everything at the same time.

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:52.240
So how does that paradox-- how
do we-- how does that hold up?

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:56.760
You described it beautifully
in your book as, I think you said,

00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.120
'the

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.880
soul was

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.400
open on all sides'.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:09.520
I think that was the expression you used,
which I really liked, open on all sides.

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:17.210
It's so, like, part of the ocean
and yet still a focalised drop.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.500
'Time and awareness', also, you named it.

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:24.400
Yeah it seems common-sensical that you

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.200
can't be both apart
and the whole at the same time.

00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:30.200
Those are mutual, exclusive categories.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:35.210
And even, you know, great spiritual
teachers - the Vedantic tradition

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:39.860
in Hinduism and other spiritual systems
have said, 'The goal of life

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:44.840
is to abandon your individuality
- dissolve that and allow yourself to be

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:48.742
absorbed into the totality
and know the bliss of absorption.'

00:57:48.942 --> 00:57:53.440
So that means all the individual
capacity which we are developing over all

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:57.260
these incarnations in this
view ends in extinction.

00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:59.420
And it's kind of wasted.

00:57:59.450 --> 00:58:00.800
And I think it's wasted.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.140
And I think that's-- it's
an inadequate world view.

00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:08.640
And what has emerged in my spiritual path
and in my psychedelic path is a very

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:11.210
different kind of world view,
that I think we share.

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.020
And that is

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:19.320
that we are moving into higher and higher,
more sophisticated forms of individuality.

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:23.520
That individuality is one
of the great gift of creation.

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:28.940
It's something that the divine
wants to encourage in its creation.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:32.550
And-- but at early stages of individuality,

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:38.960
we experience our individuality cut off
from the larger texture of surrounds.

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:41.660
So it's us against them,
or us and the whole.

00:58:41.690 --> 00:58:44.420
But when individuality

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:49.040
matures into a richer expression,
into what I would call the birth

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:53.700
of the diamond soul,
then there is both a sense of being

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:59.360
a specific defined individuality emerging
out of the specific historical lineage.

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:05.720
And yet at the same time, profoundly open
to the larger patterns of existence,

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:10.240
open to each other and compassionate
heart, open to other human beings

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:14.520
with whom we have such deep
histories with, and open

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:20.660
to-- in a sense that the intelligence
of the universe, open to the

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:24.480
perceptions and the influence
of ideas that flow into us.

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:28.820
And this communion with the universe.

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:34.640
Which-- and I actually believe
that you have to have developed a very,

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:40.040
very strong individuality to withstand
the intensity of the communion that's

00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:44.680
available to us when we enter into
communion with the one, with the whole.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.640
It is as if, if

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.520
we didn't-- if we weren't really,

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:54.400
really diamond hard and focused and clear,
when we encountered the love

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:59.080
of the universe for us,
it would just shatter us.

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.460
We have to be strong in order to actually

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:05.700
participate in the deeper
levels of communion.

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:11.120
And I think you know that-- that's such
an empowering vision, so empowering.

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.740
And it's also

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:18.180
a-- you know, I think it opens this
question of our notion of enlightenment,

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:22.080
our notion of divinity,
we have to kind of go on expanding

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:25.060
that, because it's just
a notion that we've inherited.

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:29.320
And even though it's been useful to get us

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:33.040
to where we are,
we have to just go on expanding it.

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:39.660
And, for me, what
is kind of missing more in the current,

01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:44.700
you know, modalities is creativity.

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.560
That whole idea of it coming to an end

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:54.720
and then going out into the wonderful
absorption of the whole, you know,

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.480
by maintaining the individuality

01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:02.080
at the same time, what you are maintaining
is creativity, creativity itself.

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:06.580
Because then you are like a shard
of the divine creative essence.

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:13.200
And it's like you said in your book,
'Go out and create my children.'

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.600
You know, and if there were
a divinity, let's just say,

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.340
and it wanted to have children,

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:27.380
then the thing it would want for its
children is to be free, right?

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:32.180
And to go out and create,
and to become gods within God.

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:38.700
That's the vision I hold, that we become
creator gods within the wider God.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.360
Yes. Lovely expression!
You know, small 'g' in a big 'G'.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.194
Gods within God,

01:01:44.394 --> 01:01:48.280
yeah. The creative spark
within the fire of creation.

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:49.580
Yes.

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:51.640
I agree with that.
I share that.

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:54.320
And it changes everything.

01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:56.940
It changes how we greet the children

01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:01.720
who are born into our families, because
we know that they're not coming from us.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:03.380
They're coming to us.

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:07.840
It changes how we see old people and how
we see little people,

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:12.080
because young people are not necessarily
young in terms of their soul-age.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:16.080
Old people are not necessarily
old in terms of their soul-age.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:19.300
It just opens up a much larger tapestry,

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:23.840
and it gives us
permission to recognise the deep

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:29.360
aspirations that we have towards
greatness, towards great creativity,

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:33.520
towards the great love,
towards great spiritual fulfilment.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:37.920
Things that we may or may not finish
and get through in this lifetime.

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:39.960
But we can move toward them.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.660
It's much more, in some respect,

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:47.120
sophisticated spirituality,
isn't it? It's more nuanced.

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:52.280
It requires a subtler
kind of understanding intellectually - I

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:56.780
would say intellectually but through a
subtler intelligence to understand it.

01:02:56.810 --> 01:03:01.020
It's not this sort of, you know,
here's a law of karma.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:02.660
It governs everything.

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:03.860
You know, bang!

01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:04.980
It's not that simple.

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:06.480
It's like Aurobindo says,

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:10.280
'There are layers and layers
of understanding and subtlety and nuance.'

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:13.120
It's like a-- I'm a lover of tea,
you know, fine tea.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:16.280
And when you find something like that,

01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:21.500
and you can be anything, you can be
a chess player, and you find the subtlest

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:25.600
nuances in the thing you're
really understanding.

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:29.020
The layers, and layers, and layers
as you become more attuned to it.

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:31.080
And I think that's what we are.

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:34.140
We are becoming more, and more tuned, the

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:39.780
more evolved that individual soul-essence
becomes. Then

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:43.940
the more subtle we can-- the more we can
understand, you know, these nuances.

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:49.660
And then we're kind of-- I don't know
-- that we're really inspired

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:54.640
by the-- empowered, as well,
by the creative current.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.700
I mean,

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:59.520
maybe we can leave this to the next one,
but people always talk about past lives.

01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:04.340
And my part of my teaching is like,
I'm interested in future-lives as well.

01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:08.400
And because when you expand your sense

01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:13.720
of time broadly enough, you know, really,
like, really don't hold back anything.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.560
You don't need to just look backwards.

01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:19.840
You can also remember forwards, because

01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:22.960
there's this feeling of memory
has to go back.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:25.720
But memory, also, for me,
is like, it travels forwards.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:29.380
And that's what we call revelation.

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:35.440
So revelations can come backwards and
forwards through time into this essence.

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:38.600
And this essence can be hugely expanded

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:42.900
by those revelations,
and more focused than ever

01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:46.380
in the present, you know,
in the beauty of the present moment.

01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:50.400
So, yeah, I think that's
the thought I'd like to end on.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.600
But

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.780
is there any, like-- do you
want to close this off?

01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:58.460
That's a really good thought
and a good spot to end on.

01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:02.860
To me, the principle of accumulation is

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:06.680
one of the fundamental principles I bring
to understanding what's happening

01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:10.760
in creation,
that the universe is accumulating.

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:12.600
It's learning.

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.240
It's a self-learning system.

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:16.520
And so we are constantly learning.

01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:17.860
We can't help but learn.

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:19.800
Even if we do a mediocre job in our

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.040
lifetime, we're still
learning in that lifetime.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.040
And if we do a better job, we're learning.

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:26.460
And as we learn, we activate.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:32.400
In one sense, I think we are learning
to be geniuses in every area of life.

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:34.880
A genius at chess,

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:40.040
a genius at relationships, a genius
in all the different areas of life.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:46.980
And it's as if each lifetime is a petal
in a flower, the soul is the flower.

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:48.482
And their-- if you just--

01:05:48.682 --> 01:05:52.840
I meditate sometimes on a flower
and imagine each hundred-year-lifetime is

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:58.940
a pistil, and a stamen,
and a petal in this magnificent flower.

01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:02.400
And that's, you know-- to
be a genius at life,

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:07.620
to really to be completely unfolded, and
taking advantage of the opportunity

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:11.210
that we've been given to grow
and become more than we've been.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:15.920
And, again,
so many-- even though many cultures have

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:20.100
understood reincarnation, I
don't think they've grasped it fully.

01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:25.240
They haven't really seen the
full potential of the concept.

01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:29.440
They've really seen it within an early
limitation of it.

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:32.940
And on the future,
we're going to talk about time more,

01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:36.960
I know, as we go on, but let me
just leave with the thought

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:41.160
that Robert Monroe, the great out-of-body
researcher and the founder

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.280
of the Monroe Institute
of Applied Sciences,

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:48.480
his book 'Far Journeys' / 'Ultimate
Journey', he said he reached a point

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:53.060
in his explorations out-of-body,
where he discovered he realised that you

01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:58.140
don't necessarily have to incarnate
in the next century.

01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:01.580
That incarnation isn't
necessarily historically linear.

01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:06.740
You could have former lives that were
actually lived in future time.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.880
So

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.740
that, isn't that-- that just,
like, 'Oh man,' that really--

01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:14.760
I'm going to have to unpick
that one a little bit.

01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:16.980
Yeah, that really challenges things.

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:20.210
In addition to intuiting

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:26.380
the future which is not yet,
and bringing the not yet into the now,

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:29.200
I wonder sometimes whether some of us have

01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:37.460
sampled that future time, and are
inculcating the awareness in the now.

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:43.700
That's what I would call a current
of involution as opposed to evolution.

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:46.780
There is a spiritual force coming down,

01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:52.280
and there is
an evolution-- evolving force going up,

01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:56.460
if you want to do it up and down,
but, you know, it's like a funnel.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:59.280
Yeah,
Sri Aurobindo. I love you quoting Sri Aurobindo

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.960
because he's one of my heroes
too, and he says all that clearly.

01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:04.500
And I agree.
Yeah.

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:08.560
Great.
Well, what a wonderful beginning

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.540
Chris. Thank you so much.
Yeah, I look forward to where we go next.

01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:11.673
Yeah, me too, yeah.

01:08:11.873 --> 01:08:12.780
Take care.

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:13.840
Take care Richard.

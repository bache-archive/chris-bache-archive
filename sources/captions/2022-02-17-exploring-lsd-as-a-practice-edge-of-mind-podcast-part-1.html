      <p>everybody andrew holicic here and i simply cannot contain my excitement about my guest for today dr christopher beige and so with uh a brief introduction we're going to launch in to what i believe will be quite a revelatory and i hope provocative conversation so chris phd is professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at youngstown youngstown state university where he taught for 33 years he is also adjunct faculty at the california institute of medical studies emeritus fellow at the institute of melodic sciences and on the advisory board of growth legacy training chris's passion has been the study of the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness especially psychedelic states an award-winning teacher and international speaker chris has written four books life cycles a study of reincarnation in light of contemporary consciousness research dark knight early dawn a pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness the living classroom and exploration of collective fields of consciousness and teaching and lsd in the mind of the universe the story of his 20-year journey with lsd chris is a father of three of adriana practitioner and lives in weaverville north carolina with his wife christina hardy oh my gosh chris where do we start right first of all thank you my dear friend for for taking time out of your busy schedule to talk with us it's a pleasure really i've been looking forward to this one for a while and so oh my gosh just some preparatory comments before we launch in um [Music] i have read a fair amount um over my years i consider myself bit of a an academic i love to read i love to devour books and i have to say i have never read anything like your last book lsd and the mind of the universe and so out of all the books that you've written this is the one i really want to focus on because it's no exaggeration to say that it really stretched my mind open challenged me and maybe we can talk about some of the areas where i was challenged created both tremendous resonance with my own path and also some dissonance and so that's a great way to make modern music right so maybe maybe we can create a symphony of sanity with with uh some questions to you um of which there is no shortage but one kind of preparatory comment um there's a term by the eco philosopher timothy morton that i really quite like he talks about hyper objects and he refers to this in relationship to climate change when you have something that is just so enormous yeah that is really difficult to wrap your mind around it it just defies description it's literally mind-bending mind stretching and then maybe even mind-blowing yeah and it's no exaggeration the your book in your journey is a hyper object to me um and i can't tell you how it's impacted me and how i want to really get into some of the nitty-gritty of what you went through but in order to give our listeners uh even a rough idea of what we're going to be talking about perhaps give us a a long elevator pitch okay so this is a we have a thousand floors to ascend right so this is a long elevator pitch share with us if you would um a little bit about this book um before we get into the weeds and and i start exploring particular problems with you yeah well i know it's a radical book and i think we are at a pivot point in history and i think that psychedelics represent a major transition point a true historical before and after point with respect to philosophy not just psychology it generates not only a new therapeutic protocol for healing the personal psyche but literally a new way of doing philosophy it's not really new because it goes back to the illusionian mysteries and the ayahuasca traditions in brazil but i got involved in it right out of graduate school i had just finished my phd from brown university i went to work in ohio at youngstown state i was looking around for where to begin where to continue my research i was a pretty deeply convinced agnostic at the time and i encountered realms of the human unconscious stan gross first book and that was a turning point in my life quickly followed by his methodology book lsd psychotherapy this was 1978 when i began graduate school and i saw the significance of his work for philosophy for my tradition which was philosophy of religion and i i knew that i needed to do this work that this would the people making the most substantive contributions to my discipline in the future would be people writing out of an experiential basis not simply an intellectual basis so i began to work privately um i split my life into two on my day job i was a traditional academic you know teaching courses grading papers going to meetings and all that and in my private life i began a 20-year journey working following stan groff's protocol i ended up working with high doses of lsd for reasons i described in the book this is a very aggressive protocol it's not a protocol that i would recommend today at the end of the journey but i basically did 73 high-dose lsd sessions let me say that each session was completely isolated i was separated from the world i was in what i call the psychedelic kiva a very protected environment separate from the world lying down with the sitter my sitter was a clinical psychologist who also happened to be my wife through all of my sessions uh wearing eye shades and with headphones listening to very carefully selected music to support the deepening of the process so that's where i began i worked for four years i stopped for six years again for reasons that i give in the book and then i resume for another 10 years and the method the the psychedelic method as a philosophical method involves systematically expanding the boundaries of one's consciousness and let me say that we understand that psychedelics in general and lsd in particular repre is an amplifier of consciousness it doesn't give you any specific experiences it amplifies your consciousness makes you hypersensitive for a number of hours at a time how you use that hypersensitivity very much influences what emerges over a long period of time if you go to a concert or you just sit down chat with friends you're going to have a certain level of experience but if you approach these hours in a contemplative manner if you approach them as an opportunity to go deep within your consciousness totally internalize isolating yourself from the world a journey begins it's a journey that has many levels because as we confront all the things that a hypersensitive mind throws up to us to confront and it usually starts with all the fears all the things we're ashamed of all the things we're unhappy about those are the early confrontations that lead to a the healing process but if you keep that up it keeps going deeper and deeper and deeper if you navigate this uh this journey carefully i always recorded my sessions within 24 hours and and that's really important because the more careful you are in recording your session and pondering them the clearer the deeper your next session is likely to be so there's a circle of learning that's involved so for 20 years i kept up this systematic practice and then i waited i stopped it i went from 79 to 99 and then i didn't write lsd in the in the universe i didn't publish it until 20 years later in 2019 i spent many years analyzing my experiences pondering them trying to sort them out before i was ready to really um publicly uh release this hidden side of my life my students never learned about my psychedelic work i kept a firewall between my public life and my private life in this regard and it's only after i retired from the university that i've really been willing to go public on this side of my life amazing even there there's so much to talk about let me just if i might ping one question for you just briefly i am a musician my first degree is actually in classical piano and so just briefly why why music what was the role of music and how did it help you how did you choose it i don't want to spend a ton of time on this yeah but but i am interested uh where where did that inspiration come from and how did how did it end up supporting your journey there's early research done on how music influences psychedelic sessions um i have references to that to them those sources in my work basically it creates a a field an ambiance that supports you letting go of your current physical reality relaxing and yielding to this uprushing of material that comes from the unconscious there are about five stages in the psychedelic session as the energy is building as it's peaking and as you're coming down it's hours you know it's eight hours of the day and you have to choose music to support each stage of that process so the music would be very aggressive and very long chordal sequences with powerful crescendos in the early stages long expansive passages in the middle stages gradually tapering off into quieter and quieter and gentler music at the end after after only a year or so i basically stopped using classical music which is more commonly used i shifted to using a lot of indigenous music because i found it to be more powerfully evocative it helped me go into let go of my conventional reality and enter into unusual reality well that's really interesting chris because it um in the inner yogas of contract buddhism which i know you're a student of the vajrayana yeah as you know the the subtle body is actually the kind of frequency of the the domain that is literally quite in resonance with sound and so when we're actually touched by music it's really our subtle body that is touched and this is really interesting to me because when you talk about this journey which in one way and i'd be curious to see if this resonates with you i i i really appreciated your frequent allusions to the work of carl jung and um i don't remember you saying this overtly but the process of individuation how it is the bringing the unconscious processes into the light of conscious awareness is what in fact constitutes one vector of awakening and so the reason this is interesting to me is that the subtle body is is also connected to the unconscious mind and so in a certain way um and let me see if this is landing with you when you're working with this type of music it's almost as if you're creating a tuning fork an invitational harmonic in external auditory mechanisms or mediums that therefore could perhaps evoke correlative inner qualities that help you in fact bring these processes into light of consciousness is it fair to say something like that i think that's fair you know basically i think that's a good description the subtle body is very actively involved in the psychedelic process when you open up into deeper states of consciousness i learned that deeper states of consciousness are higher levels of energy and so it places enormous demands on your physical body but particularly their subtle energy body and so um it's it's very the subtle energy body is very much involved it's a very you're moving into highly stimulated states which are not simply psychologically stimulating but they're energetically subtle energetically stimulating and physically stimulating yeah that really makes so much sense to me but i want to put an exclamation point and return to something that you intimated that you also ping on later in your book connected to this kind of amplification using these agents as means to heighten awareness and amplifying the mind and what you said at the end really struck me because in fact i was a student of uh shogun trump a statement that i always took from him to be pejorative negative that lsd is super samsara i originally heard that as a negative your twist on it was fantastically alchemical or tantric because now you put a positive spin on it that in a very beautiful way the super samsara gives you the opportunity to bring these unconscious processes into the light of awareness and therefore i think that the word you use is is confront even confrontation the word you can say inner jihad right to wrestle with these inner dimensions as a way again in the alchemical or contract spirit to transform these super samsara into nirvana through proper relationship is that is that one way to talk about what you experience as well it is i want to i want to tag two items there the first one uh again it all depends on how you meet this super samsara sansara is very addictive it's very distracting it's very alluring and if you increase the the your sensitivity to samsara it can take you on a journey that just will just distract you and lead you and uh it really doesn't take you anywhere except through into more samsara but if you use this opportunity in a true contemplative fashion to look deeply at the samsara that's there then you you find that you the samsara will fall apart you would really take the samsaric tendencies to their roots and when you take them to their roots they become uprooted and you begin to move into deeper levels deeper levels of samsara but then eventually into the levels that go beyond samsara into extra samsaric levels of reality into the bardo but then eventually into extrasome sorry levels of reality now i wanna the second point i wanna mention is people use psychedelics for many different purposes some for recreation some to hyper stimulate creativity but three basic purposes are therapeutic healing which is the dominant way that people are using psychedelics today in the psychedelic renaissance to heal the wounds of life of the personal psyche second for spiritual realization to accelerate one's awakening to accelerate the immune ones awareness of nirvana are entering into the condition of nirvana and this is why i had started this is what got me started like many people in the late 70s into the psychedelic work but eventually and very quickly really that agenda fell away in my practice partly because of the very powerful protocol that i adopted personal enlightenment fell away as not a significant part of my journey it came back around in the end and it was always there but it wasn't the primary modality collective awakening became very important that is working on behalf of the human family the bodhisattva vow in a sense came through very strongly but eventually my work settled into a third agenda which i would call cosmological exploration the the what my work became was a long journey into what i think of as the consciousness of the universe or the consciousness of the creative intelligence that's behind the universe and within the universe and you don't need to explore all those deep pathways in order to awaken spiritually you don't need to go into archetypal reality you don't need to go back to the birth of the universe in order to awaken to the truth of your essential nature as the buddhist would say or to your christ consciousness as the christians would say and so i wanted to differentiate cosmological exploration from the project of spiritual awakening because if we hold cosmological exploration to the measures or criteria of success of spiritual awakening i think i think we're going to miss the mark of what's actually taking place in the journey oh my gosh chris you're going to the deep end of the pool yeah wow so let's unpack this because i think this is really interesting this is super important in my opinion because it begs a number of questions one is the relationship between excuse me the individual and the collective the individual and the cosmos and and therefore deep as a scholar of religion and philosophy deep questions about the nature of mind and reality that um i guess to paraphrase it i mean there's so many ways to get into this but one one question that comes to mind is is it in fact the mind that's in the universe or the universe that's in the mind in other words what exactly is the relationship between the individual and the cosmic and is in fact part of what i hear is a dissonance potential dissonance for me is a is a subtle um cosmological dualism that there therefore seems to intimidate a difference between the individual and the cosmic that there's still some sense of separation implied there so let maybe help me understand that tease that apart for me because if i notice in one of your footnotes you talk that if you were to pin yourself into a corner philosophically you would you would define yourself as a modest and so how does monism play into this if in fact you're intimating of subtle dualism uh it's only a functional dualism which all monastic traditions recognize um fun at cora i'm a monist at heart and this comes it's not a philosophical position it's a it's an experiential position um the deeper one goes into one's own consciousness eventually come to that point where where let me let me back up and start again contemporary thought scientific thought tends to see the physical world as the only world that exists and they tend to see the physical world as operating by mechanistic processes that there is not consciousness in atomic in chemical processes and that consciousness somehow pops into existence at some point in the evolutionary process now there are lots of philosophical reasons for challenging the adequacy of that understanding of consciousness and i align with those philosophers who are pan psychists who believe that consciousness or the what you might think of as ur consciousness a core origin consciousness is present in physical reality or energetic reality from the very start and that conscious consciousness isn't added later but consciousness is part of the emerging universe from the big bang forward so that just marked that okay experientially when one when one shatters one's personal mind when when one reaches the limits where your personal history can no longer contain what's happening in your mind and when you've excavated through the various levels of your personal unconscious one drops into a larger field of consciousness part of that one of the part of the field you drop into is the field of your species mind and here's the common ground with carl jung the collective psyche but if you keep working and dropping and dropping and dropping you deep it drop into deeper and deeper larger and larger levels of consciousness until eventually you're in very familiar very territory that's very familiar to the mystics when they are talking about god consciousness are talking about all is one the experience over and over again is that the entire universe both its physical manifestation and it's the mind that underlies this manifestation is fundamentally a single organism and that all life takes place within this single singularity in all life is a manifestation of an emergence of the singularity in diversity and when we first began to discover this underlying reality what i would call the mother universe that underlies the daughter universe of the physical world during the axial age you know about three to five thousand years ago it was so what we encountered when we began to get have the the meditation techniques or the psychedelic techniques in the early hindu soma to drop into this reality it was so intoxicating and so ecstasy filled that we developed an interpretation of life that said that the purpose the purpose of life was to get back to that that there is nothing worth holding on to in physical reality there is nothing worth holding on to in individuality what you really want to do is take the drop and put it back into the ocean you want to dissolve ego and end up in back into the oneness and i understand that but i think it's a fundamentally flawed cosmology now that we're beginning to understand how old the universe how big it is how intelligent it is how how long it's been working to bring forward the more evolved forms of life that it has to think that after 13.7 billion years of evolution when just a few thousand years ago we've become self-conscious enough to be able to penetrate our individual consciousness and discover this underlying cosm cosmic consciousness which holds the entire universe just when we discover that then we want to dissolve and disappear out of existence all together to go home makes no sense i don't think that's and what i've learned or what i've been taught in my sessions is that the universe wants to support individuality not the prism not not the individuality that's imprisoned within solitary egoic awareness but a robust individuality of what we might call the soul which is open and porous and in constant exchange with the larger rhythms of life this is the both and position that when one awakens spiritually one literally becomes more of an individual than you were before you awakened you know so there's a so there is a i think that when we go deep we not only discover the oneness and we discover that that oneness is the essence of our individual being classic is problem the essence of the individual is the essence of the totality but now we discover that brahman delights in manifesting atman and in growing atman and in atman waking up to its own true nature and then that waking up is just a stage in a larger evolutionary process of empowerment so that we literally learn to become more and more and more of a conscious synthesis of individuality and spiritual totality oh chris oh my gosh i can hardly contain myself here i mean talk about diamonds from heaven i mean this is your journey you're not johnny appleseed you're you're johnny diamond siege your wife is throwing diamonds but but let me just maybe this is an issue of semantics and and the nuance of talking yeah what a challenge when you start talking about um nature of mind and reality using dualistic mechanisms you're headed into trouble so but help me understand a couple of things when when you talk about um the universe wants to support and and there are other intimations in your in your book that i found very compelling how it is that you felt from day one that there was a larger intelligence that was guiding your journey that you felt held by the beloved and and i remind me to come back to this because i want to share a personal story about my own retreat time where this this came into real dissonance with me um as a as a practicing buddhist because as you know on the buddhist tradition their biggest one of their biggest teachings is on emptiness uh non-theism and that sort of thing and so i'm i'm wrestling a little bit with reconciling things like nothingism and emptiness with what you're talking about so to be a little bit more articulate about this let's be point a little bit more point-blank for my end how do you reconcile mantheism with this notion of universal intelligence which almost seems to intimidate a creator principle a god if we dare say because you almost seem to be implying that there is a divine transhuman intelligence god whatever term you want to depend to it that somehow is in fact your beloved it is holding you guiding you nurturing how do you reconcile that with the teachings on emptiness and non-theism yeah it's really not difficult when you when you move into it um so let's focus on the buddhist teaching of anata no self emptiness of self shunyatta transp which can also be transparent translated transparency i think i really endorse the buddhist position of its radical agnosticism i think it's an anti-theism so basically it's a critique that says every theism which is being proposed or has been proposed has structural flaws to it that it so the concept of god the concept of theism uh is critiqued as being inadequate and in its place buddhism proposes a pure process understanding of reality that everything is dynamic everything is constantly changing everything is fluid everything is in process there is nothing which holds its existence by itself you only exist in the interplay of the whole ocean of causality of karmic forces cosmic down to species down to individual it's all an open system and when you when you wake up to your essential nature you don't you don't wake up to a separate thing you wake up to a fluid process and you breathe now the fluid process of existence i take that to heart and that resonates with my experience in that every i experienced myself as constantly being guided and instructed and tutored in my psychedelic sessions but the nature of that consciousness that held me and broke me down and and opened me and then broke me down some more the nature of that consciousness never revealed itself as a being as a person as a personality and the very structure of what it was that i was engaging kept expanding and changing now in psychedelic states you don't learn or you learn by becoming what it is that you're trying to learn about you don't take the ego there and have an experience of something you literally shatter and you dissolve and become this so my experience was that when i began to become aware of this this other that was holding me and guiding me and i began to ask it who are you what are you i experienced a death which then dissolved me into a deeper level of reality where i discovered that i was this was myself it was a deeper level of quote myself not my personal self capital m yeah and this repeated itself over and over and over for hours on this one particular session until eventually it brought me into the realization that it's an endless progression it's it's a seamless consciousness within this vast consciousness we are an individual consciousness confronting an infinite consciousness how we experience ourselves at the moment of contact as we dissolve into it influence what arises out of this infinite consciousness and that's that awareness that this consciousness that i was engaging and discovered myself to be part of was truly infinite and open-ended and that i reached a point 15 years into the journey where i discovered i would never reach the end of it it was an infinite progression no matter how many years i did this work there was always more to discover so that means and that to me resonates very deeply with the buddhist position on uh its critique of theism its critique of gods that have physical forms or the critique of gods that are come out of human history and that are we can understand to be partial approximations attempts to understand something which are partially adequate and radically inadequate at the same time you know so when you move beyond individual consciousness and move into the collective psyche and begin to engage some of the dynamics of the collective psyche part of what you engage are all the stories that we've been telling ourselves for tens of thousands of years all the values that have been involved in these stories which have been reinforcing themselves on all these cultural traditions and there comes a point where you die out of the collective psyche just as earlier you had died out of your personal psyche and when you die out of the collective psyche you move into a states of awareness which are trans species which are go far beyond the entire human history and at that point you're moving into states of awareness that are radically radically beyond and clearer than any states of consciousness that take place within the collective psyche and you just you realize that all the stories of our religions are part of the collective psyche story and that there are realities are far far beyond any of those realities and i think that buddhism is pointing to that phenomena when it says it's it's fundamentally agnostic it says you shouldn't restrict yourself to any limiting belief about god however you can experience the reality that we're pointing to you know we can experience this reality but our understanding of it will always be partial and fragmented oh my goodness so jeez every every one of these little snippets we can run off for a couple hours on this yeah there are a couple things here that really stood out for me chris and again there's there's these are really seed syllables for massive arenas for conversation but one is is what you talk about so beautifully in your book and i have not read living classroom yet but i i literally just got it in the mail and that is this radical revolutionary new pedagogical approach which you talk about and i love it this this transition from kind of newtonian atomistic pedagogy individuality separate from others to a kind of a quantum entangled pedagogy where using the mixing metaphor is the connective tissue of consciousness that you're really you're learning by becoming i mean what a fantastic thing to say which by the way has resonance in both the hindu and buddhist traditions through what my languaging is the gnostic pedagogical approach of hearing contemplating meditating which is ingest digest metabolize until the teachings actually are purified filtered from conceptual defilements into full somatic embalment embodiment and there that's where true knowing comes from and so i love that aspect of your journey that that it introduces a type of pedagogy that is completely resonant with the classic uh wisdom traditions you experience this through your journey i also want to come back to and this is key to me and this was a really really big experience for me when i did my three year retreat where i experienced what you're referring to for the first time in my life and i wrestled with it chris because it really at that time it wasn't dissonance with my unders obviously a limited understanding of emptiness and not non-theism where i did feel um i was being held and loved by something bigger than me and this really um created a rub for me because it was like hey wait a second i i thought there was no externality i thought it was all scallops you know it's not solid cystic but it's just mind only so how how can there be an external agency without capitulating to the god principle and and so what i want to share with you that again your book was such an inspiration for me is that in a very real way when i was doing these guru yogas and devotional practices properly my mind broke i died to a limited self-sense i had you know we can come back to this in a little bit there's just tremendous hardship and pain before that breakthrough occurred and then the minute that happened i felt this complete container mandala holding environment of love and dare i say and this is in quotations an external agency that was in fact holding me and then what became unbelievably interesting to me chris was in a certain way in the third year of my retreat i lost something i lost some of these initial qualities and so at first it was like wait a second i i where where did my magical nature of mine go and and i was i really entered kind of a dark night of the soul within my three-year retreat and a llama came in and said something that just floored me that um it was a female llama that said the dakinis can bestow awakening and they can take it away and and i said what what like that was like oh you know it was like a big bong just in my head but it was so true it felt like somehow it had been taken away and it took me decades chris to finally understand the really brutal painful powerful lesson that was developing in my retreat and you mentioned this a little bit in the very last chapter of your book which i thought was just absolutely genius that i was getting stuck in a kind of almost spiritual bypassing or transcendentalism in the negative sense that i was dissolving into these completely formless realms where i became the universe and and i realized on one level when this agency for lack of a better term took it away the and this is my thought bubble probably akin to some of the thought bubbles that entered you it was like the command was you will find me in form or you will not find me at all in other words it was almost as if don't get stuck on this formless stuff don't get stuck in the transcendental aspect come back to the earth come back to the imminent come back into body and that turned out to be one of the most radically challenging and eventually over 20 years of trying to incorporate that revelatory experiences of the retreat was that no it's not about this ascent into this fundamental godhead that's just half the journey the other half the the involutionary half is taking that and bringing it riveting it um molding it back into the earth and so um i want to pause just to share that story with you because when you share that in your book it was like oh my gosh this is exactly resonant with what happened in my own experience so i want to return to you if you don't mind help me further understand and this will help many of my listeners who are buddhists who really work in the realm of non-theism and emptiness the so-called agency the beloved that in fact can embrace that we can call on that we can work with it that we really are not alone we can take refuge in these greater forces to help us along our path so sorry for the long-winded interjection but i wanted to describe it because i appreciate it very powerful my own experience not just a theoretical thing this was a big deal in my own practice life yeah you know um maybe it's a footnote to my earlier comment to bridge into this new wing i think sri aurobindo's critique of buddhism is correct in that he he criticizes buddhism for not sufficiently confronting the fact of existence the the extraordinary power and majesty of existence in in rejecting anything static and anything in form in its agnosticism in its anti-theism and it's i'm not taught teaching all of that is well and good but he says we have to come to terms with the fact of the magnitude and the genius and the majesty of the universe of which we are apart now buddhism may say well thank you very much we don't need that what we really need is freedom from our suffering i'll take the freedom from suffering and i'm not going to engage in the metaphysical quote speculation and arbendo's response is it's not an either or and it's a certain kind of a capitulation to not confront some of the magnitude of the breath of life and i think that now to move more towards what you were describing when we have these breakthroughs when we do the work and we go through the purification processes and and we face our shortcomings and and we let go and we let go and we immerse ourselves deeper and deeper and then when we have these melting experiences where as you say we are embraced we are held by orders of of of genius and orders of love beyond anything we had ever experienced before and one can go deeper into that there's there's i've learned that there's so many levels of oneness and there's even levels of of the void of the fertile void though that seems like a contradiction there are levels of that and you can go deeper and deeper into that and it feels initially like an external or an other because it wasn't there before or we didn't experience it before but we do now and it's it clearly is not inside of us it feels outside of us because it's holding us but the more sorry i'm having something peeping off back here that's okay it's all good the more you go back and forth into that condition and back out again and into it and press it of course the more you realize that you're just waking up to your own nature you're weak because your nature and this universal nature is the same nature that our essential nature is this vast expanse this love that floods us from outside is actually a love which is welling up also from with inside the challenges is stabilizing those insights and and bringing them into our daily experience now i think this is a this is a challenge of all spiritual practice of course we go on these long retreats we get into subtle subtle territories we come back to the honking horns and it's just it's so difficult to hold on and to integrate day-to-day and this is particularly the case i think in psychedelic practice whether you're using psychedelics as a spiritual practice or whether you're using psychedelics as i did as a measure aiming at cosmological exploration because in my experience in what i did i think i pushed myself far far deeper into the consciousness of the universe than i could ever ever internalize and stabilize in this lifetime and i came to realize during my time after that i came off the mountain after i stopped my work when i was beginning to kind of just come off the mountain come away from that long period of practice that i had i had created an imbalance an unwitting imbalance i thought that because i had integrated each session thoroughly and carefully and conscientiously that i could step back from my sessions and i could take all these blessings with me and i learned that uh i had basically leaned so heavily into transcendence that i had sort of lost my foothold in imminence and i knew from my experiences that the entire universe was the body of divine are the body of this infinite consciousness i knew that i was never outside of divine reality inside physical reality but i could not hold that awareness yet inside physical reality i know that there are beings who do the great beings are always one's guides in these things but i had and it's kind of like you i think what what i i was kind of kicked off of the path kicked off of the mountain by the sessions themselves i did not know i was ending them they were being ended but there came i had these last sessions which basically let me know that it was time to end and one of the things i learned in the process of ending is that i had to not expand my consciousness i had to not alter my consciousness in any way if the states of being that i had experienced in my sessions were ever going to come and awaken fully inside my historical existence so i had to sit with the shell of my historical existence if i was ever going to fully integrate these vast bliss domains of ecstatic presence and i think i i think i did go farther than was good for me and i i have been in a completely different but equally important process since i stopped my sessions the way the sessions put it or the way my meditation put it is there is the uh the dying of uh discovering and then the dying of keeping and i had done the dying of discovery but now i had to do the dying of keeping and that's a different process yeah wow i mean you're stopping my mind with every one of these so many things here but a couple things so much about this is mind-bending it it's really mental yoga stretching almost to the breaking point and so a couple questions here is and i wrestle with this i mean the integrity of your being chris your presence the clarity of your writing the elegance of your scholasticism your academic predispositions and the like i have to say have been incredibly important for me to substantiate the veracity of your journey and i see it with the mobility of simply the way you're presenting yourself it's like this is the real deal but it is such a mind stretch and so a couple of things along this beautiful challenge of stretching into the notion of i love your nomenclature here psychedelic practice i've never heard that before so talk to us a little bit about this revolutionary notion greed you know the skids have been greased by michael pollan james kingsland stan groth these amazing predecessors the shoulders upon which you now stand where you can now um silently but radically proclaim the validity of entheogen psychedelics as path so yeah talk a little bit more about the practice of psychedelics um how to work this is as a path and then to come back to before i forget parenthetically the the importance of integration and the danger of disintegration in other words were you ever afraid of going insane that you were stretched beyond your capacities to contain and instead of stretching you snap so again there's two big noodles thrown there the first noodles yeah the first and i think in many ways probably the most important is talk to us about psychedelics as practice and path and then to come back maybe a little bit about the process of integration versus disintegration sanity versus insanity yeah well you know in different interviews that i've done i make the point that i've never tripped people say you've done 73 trips i said no i've never tripped uh i've done sessions these are therapeutically focused sessions but actually i i'm in my own mind i think of the japanese term sashim the sashin is a meditation retreat it's a period of time set aside for spiritual intense spiritual practice so when i just talk about lsd sessions i could be talking about lsd sashim it is a period of time set aside for uh therapeutic work for spiritual work for cosmological work uh and there are certain just as in a sashim your daily life changes you change your schedule you change your eating you change your sleeping patterns you change your rhythm in order to focus and intensify this practice just as you did when you did your three-year retreat everything changes around this long period of sustained introspection the same is true in the psychedelic process the the critical the underbelly of using psychedelics as part of a practice of transformation an organized practice of of transformation the underbelly is that it's temporary you only have these states for a few hours at a time and even if you use them diligently you still only have them for a few hours of a time at a time which is really the major reason why i stopped it it became too painful for me to keep coming back from these states until eventually i made a deal with my beloved my name for this intelligence whatever it is that it would not bring me back into these dimensions again until i could stay it became it was just too painful to come and go um but before you get to that point you can do a lot of cleaning you can you do a lot of healing and you would you can do a lot of good for other people in that what happened in my work after about two and a half years when i went through this what stan calls the perinatal process and all you go through this reliving with your birth confronting all the fears of death confronting the fundamental existential crisis of whether there is any meaning in existence eventually going to a complete shattering of your individual egoic reality i thought oh that's great i've gone through an ego death it was a shattering experience things are going to open up now i'm going to go into clean sailing not what happened what happens that everything cranked up all over again the suffering got worse and it expanded for two years of practice into larger and larger levels thousands hundreds of thousands of people thousands and thousands of years i had entered the hill realms and i and at first i thought this is like a deeper level of ego death but eventually i came to understand that no this was not about me at all this was not about fundamentally my personal transformation or my personal awakening or even my personal healing this was about trying to heal some aspect of the collective psyche that there is an organizational structure a consciousness that that is our species consciousness and all the wounds of history that are left unresolved are not only left unresolved at an individual soul level but they are left unresolved at the species level so all the wars we've fought all the terrible things we've done to each other all the trauma to the extent that that trauma is not healed it it resides as unfinished business within the collective psyche and every spiritual practitioner who goes deeply enough in whatever methodology they're using is given often an invitation if they choose to exercise it to lift some of that suffering not out of their personal life but to lift some of that suffering out of the collective psyche and for reasons that i think are sole choice that became a large part of my work and i think there's nothing really special here i mean this is what any mother who sees a child suffering is going to do if she can do something to try to help that child's suffering to alleviate it any father worth assault is going to try to help a suffering child if we are given the opportunity we're going to try to help other people who are in pain this is just the normal workings of life so to me in fact it became a mystery to me why the collective suffering stopped why i wasn't allowed to stay in there anymore when clearly there's continuing collective suffering in the human psyche why was i taken into deeper levels beyond that levels which were very difficult very challenging but they were not involved with collective pain uh i'm losing the the second part of your question that you would ask yeah no happy happy to throw it back up because there's again there's so much richness coming out um that's returning to to this notion of uh we've circumambulated this but haven't really directed uh talked about the place of fear and role of integration versus disintegration did you ever actually fear um especially coming back to the so-called real world for your sanity i mean did you ever feel you're going to become so unhinged because let me just say this very briefly chris one of the things that was profoundly resonant with with your work and this is what just blew me away this kind of on one level i've come to see psychedelics is a type of tantra and by this what i mean is and this has been a radical change in my more conservative nature being more traditionalist and paying homage again there's tremendous genius to the power of tradition but there are also some near enemies ossification um refining even the tradition itself losing tributaries of new information and growth yeah and so i used to be really somewhat disdainful of of these um uh kind of psychedelic approaches is chemical mysticism in the pejorative sense these kind of cheap fixes but i've really changed my tune and that i now see them as a type of tantra by that what i mean is that in tantra body is as important as mind and now we're talking about body very subtle body we're talking about chemical body we're talking about body at the level of of neurochemistry basically and so i think again within the context of psychedelics as practice and path it actually can fit in an expanded rubric of tantra where body in this case chemistry is as important as the mind that is evoked in this kind of neuropharma um from neurophenomenological way to use the neural end to bring about these phenomenal states yeah and so with that in mind yeah the question was the role of fear here and integration versus disintegration and how that relates to your ability to contain this information you uh i had i did come into places to go through a death rebirth cycle is always an ordeal at one level or another it always involves a surrender to the unknown it always involves yielding to a certain fear that's holding your system locked in place and there were places where at advanced stages of the game that i truly did fear for my sanity or at least i knew that i was going someplace that was completely beyond anything which i could hold on to i could not hold on to sanity as i had known it and it was like going over a waterfall and you just but once you go through that once you go over that waterfall and you experience that death and you experience waking up in a new reality as a new being a new kind of being not only a new and improved you but a different kind of being where for hours at a time you can experience the universe as it experiences itself completely beyond any human right frame of reference once you experience it that is the nature of the cycle and this is one of the the great gifts that i got from stan groth was the absolute conviction that if you let these experiences take you wherever they want to take you even though you don't understand them even though you don't understand why it's happening this way and it's extremely painful if you surrender completely it will always take you through a crisis and it'll catch you on the other side and it will receive you and there there is a blessing waiting for you on that other side and for me coming back from a session it's nev i've i have no trauma from any of my psychedelic history i can listen to the music i used and even the most horrifying aspects of the journey and i love it i'm completely comfortable with it i can talk about any of the difficult portions without any resonating any trauma because when you take it all the way through you complete the cycle things get bad they get worse they get worse they get very very bad but if you let surrender it'll take you through to a completion into ecstasy and then what you bring back is this entire cycle you bring back the knowledge that things get bad but then things get great and that's the rhythm of death and rebirth that is the spiral of death and rebirth now that doesn't mean and i thought as long as that was going on i was peaches that you know that if i was holding everything in balance what i did find however is that other thing we talked about you can go so far into the ecstasy you can go so deep into transcendence that literally learning how to live with your memories becomes a major challenge so as a spiritual practice this practice is different from classical spiritual practices which are much more emphasizing kind of holding on to everything relatively speaking holding on to where you go in smaller increments i have an i have an understanding of how the universe works but i don't live within that reality on a 24 7 basis the great beings live within that reality on a 24 7 basis so being able to i'm speaking out of my memory and it's good to have memories of these realities i mean i really think that changed my life but it's one thing to be speaking out of memory it's another thing to be speaking out of an immediate present right here living experience of this reality yeah and learning you can internalize so many profound memories that it literally becomes challenging to live with those memories they haunt you for the rest of your life and they haunt you in a good way they're not they don't haunt you in any negative way you literally are haunted by the beauty of the universe all right and so you just you try to live it an embodiment as best as you can um yeah do you think do you think chris one of the things that really struck me was what you just paraphrased and i have to say in this part of the book i i struggled with this part of this part of the book when you were talking about just all the pain all the hardship all the dot the death the the unbelievably wrenching section about the the dying children was it was almost too much and so yeah i i hung in there and i'm glad i did in a certain way almost metaphoric if you're hanging in there but is it possible that that perhaps the what was being invited was developing a one taste relationship to both the heaven and the hell that there would in fact be no preference and no because that's what they say allegedly the very highest stages before the 11th boomi the highest um kind of membrane barrier before awakening is no preference whatsoever for samsara nor nirvana discovering the inseparability so do you think on one level that the agency was somehow eliciting the teaching lesson of great equanimity that in fact relate to the agony in the same way you relate to the ecstasy to realize that there's fundamentally no preference for either that that that may have been what was being suggested there does that resonate with you i understand the teaching and that teaching does come up and reflect certain aspects of the journey i'm not sure that it reflects this particular aspect uh in a in a satisfying way i have a different way of understanding because you're talking here about the ocean of what i call the ocean of suffering and um you know one of the things i describe in the book is insights that came much later in the session that i don't think everybody has to go into something like the ocean of suffering i don't think everybody has to go into the hill realms or spend as long in the hell realms as i spent there i mean i don't think people need to be afraid of going through what i went through as kind of a necessary part of any kind of spiritual journey or cosmological exploration i think that this was something that my chose my soul chose to do before i was born it it manifested so quickly in my sessions after a couple of years and it was such a tenacious and sustained part of my journey that i came to understand that this was literally a soul's choice and and i i say this without pride at all because i think there are many many many beings in the world today who have made the same choice i think we are living in a critical time in history we are living in a time when the sins of the fathers literally are just pouring out of us and i i don't i quote the biblical passage not to put this all on men but that really the limitations of our up to now standard of our evolutionary standard are just pouring out of us because we are being challenged to move into our next evolutionary step not only as individuals but as the species that the creative intelligence of the universe is trying to awaken not only individual spiritual practitioners but the game is collective now it's desperately trying to awaken the entire human species and the the hill realms that one are literally manifesting on earth as part of this collective detoxification process and i think there are many beings who are have taken the bodhisattva vow into their life and are working to alleviate suffering collectively socially politically and also cycle spiritually because i think this century is different than earlier centuries because there's a boiling taking place there's a there's a there's a churning which is taking place deep within and so i assumed that i knew what i was getting into and i volunteered for this work and i know that it's a hard chapter to read even though i cut it down to the minimal form it's difficult material uh and yet i've had so many people write me and say i know exactly what you're talking about because i've been i've been going through these experiences for years or i went through them and i didn't understand them you've helped me understand them some well but i think it's it's not an unusual experience um once we understand that what's taking place here is a collective dynamic it's something that we as an individual may have started but the universe uses our individual initiative to accomplish something of its purpose of its agenda and its agenda is to heal the human species in order to clear out the dross that is holding us back to make more room for the infusion of grace our energy our awareness that is coming to carry humanity through this crisis that we are coming into we literally cannot afford to be a planet that's run by egos anymore yeah for sure we're just killing the planet we need to be a planet that's r run by awakened souls and by that i mean beings who have a a conscious awareness of their history so that they know that they are not simply egos separate private cells that they have a an awakened soul consciousness where they know themselves to be spiritual beings in dynamic relationship with other spiritual beings including non-human beings in this world you know animal kingdom and when we wake up in that way and we discover how old we are and how many generations we've been doing this and we discover the breadth of our human of our relationships with other beings then naturally we make different choices as we make more inclusive choices we make choices for the long term we make choices on that serves the good of all and right now i think we desperately need to be making choices that are inclusive and work for the good of all yeah that's really beautiful with your permission and if you don't want to go here that's fine i want to turn again i have to contain both my enthusiasm and the energy of like oh my gosh we need to talk about that we need to talk about that so i'm letting so much slide that it it's fantastic but with your kind permission um i want to turn to the this issue of the the scientific and academic elephant in the room how do we know if anything any of this is actually true how do we know um issues of rapid replicability i mean how do we know if if what you're seeing is idiosyncratic to your own biochemistry that this and again in the best sense of the word not pejorative this is your trip yeah and and how how do we know that if if a thousand other people did exactly what you did that they could even come close to replicating your insights or would they in fact have their own particular biological historical phenomenological whatever matrix whereby they would see and write um a different journey a different book through 20 years of exploration so the issue here is the problem of proof and universality what would happen if a thousand people did exactly what you did and they came up with a thousand different visions i mean how certain are you that what you're experiencing is actually true yeah or simply your enculturation your your own unique biochemistry and all the histories that bring about the narrative that you're sharing with us so are you okay going in this direction absolutely that's a really important question i mean that's like a foundational question because if if this is only echoes from my own personal psyche or even echoes from the collective psyche then it has a certain kind of epistemic value but it doesn't really have sufficient epistemic value that we that warrants our attention and i i discussed this all the way back in uh dark night early dawn in the first chapter where i'm outlining what it me this phil psychedelic philosophy and there's a section there called the epistemic warrant of psychedelic experience where i flesh out this question and look at what the issues are involved in this in questioning whether these experiences truly do have epistemic value so that's i just point there also ken ring and i have had a dialogue about this uh ken his good friend wonderful researcher near-death episode i've used his books for years in my classes he challenged me on the same questions and we did a dialogue eventually we published it in uh i'm blanking on where it is it should i should have this at the tip of my tongue yeah it's online uh it's quite the essay is our deep psychedelic experience is trustable yeah and um if it were just my experiences that would be one thing but here's i think the great value of stan groff's work where stan groff has collected psychedelic experiences from hundreds if not thousands of people over decades and he's integrated them into a certain model of what happens at different stages of the journey my experiences fit squarely within the broader phenomenological discussion of experiences that he has already outlined and so i think that he provides in a sense a broad epistemic warrant for look taking seriously my maybe a little unusually intense or maybe a little unusually deep my experiences but there's not too much new here when you look at the full breadth of experiences that he's reported in his many many books culminating in his great masterwork of the way of the psychonaut so there's a deep you know overlap there another point i think i'm thinking of michael saban who was a cardiologist in the early days of the near-death episode movement and he was very upset that people were talking about coming back from a cardiac arrest and talking about spiritual realities he didn't believe in any of that stuff and he was going to systematically disprove it and uh he eventually wrote a book in which he came to the conclusion this stuff is real and you differentiate between what he calls the local event and the transcendent event that when somebody has is in surgery or has a cardiac arrest they get out of they have a sensation of getting out of their body and they can experience what's going on in the local arena the surgical theater the waiting room down the hall the hospital what's going on in the parking lot outside and then they go into the light and they they leave physical reality and they go into a transcendental reality he says we can't evaluate the transcendent experience that they have but we can evaluate the accuracy of their local experience and that's what he tries to do whether what they think they experience locally is in fact verified verifiable in that world and he he provided evidence that in fact it was now that doesn't prove that the transcendent experience is true but it certainly increases the credibility that if it's the local experience is true the transcendent experiences gets a little bit more little boost of credibility the same thing happens in psychedelic experiences many psychedelic experiences are such that they can be verified information about the conditions of birth or circumstances of birth the things that people learn that they really we can reasonably exclude the possibility that they had learned through natural means and yet it turns out that these things can be validated that plays here the other part though is i think um cross-validation other people having similar experience communal confirmation exactly now what we find is this when people start working with psychedelics if you took a hundred people from a hundred different backgrounds different socio-cultural backgrounds different trainings and whatnot they would have very different experiences because psychedelics or lsd is an amplifier it doesn't take you to a particular experience it amplifies your mind and because we have different histories we come in contact with different experiences however stan reports that when people go through the perinatal death rebirth process our experiences get very very concentrated and very standardized we begin to deal with issues which are not idiosyncratic but are universal fundamental existential issues and that when people navigate the death rebirth experience every person that he is experienced who goes through that process comes back with a an understanding of spiritual reality which is fundamentally compatible with each other that there is a spiritual world that was waiting for us and receives us from then it's a matter of evaluating our individual explorations of that spiritual world now what i did in uh my first in my first book on psychedelics near darknet early dawn i put together three areas of inquiry psychedelic research near-death episode research and out-of-body research particularly the work of robert monroe founder of the monroe institute of applied science author of three books exploring the out-of-body state and i asked whether these cosmologies that emerged from these separate bodies of exploration autobody research near-death episode research psychedelic research are there cosmological visions diverging or are they converging and once you look at them carefully they are converging they are clearly converging so that's addressing the question are are these experiences trustworthy now in my dialogue with ken ring i present other reasons why i think they're trustworthy and that is for every time i had my own cultural expectations fulfilled because i'm educated in world religions i'm educated in comparative spirituality i have an understanding of certain of these things but for every time i've had them confirmed i've also had more experiences that that shatter my expectations i learned things i was not expecting i i learned an understanding of reincarnation how reincarnation works and where it's taking us that i was not expecting at all i wasn't expecting anything about the birth of the future human there was nothing about my conditioning which led me to think that humanity was coming into this crossroads there were so many things that i was shown so consistently that were far and beyond anything that i had personally expected that i think one can reasonably conclude that this is a confrontation with truly an independent reality and i mean independent i have to qualify that but a reality that it was not simply echoing back to me my own expectations and if you study the work of other people who push deeply into these conditions into these states i think we find a fundamental convergence which doesn't mean we're seeing the exact same thing but the issue is do our do our visions overlap are they coherent with each other do they overlap now clearly we're only at the very early stages of this inquiry what's important is not any one person's experience what's important is when we get if we were to be able to get a standardized protocol take 100 people a thousand people with some type of standardized protocol with very very different backgrounds and put them through the same regimen of internal introspective work then we get all of their testimony all of their experiences put them all on the table and begin to look at what is it that's consistent and what is idiosyncratic that's where where we're going we're just are not there yet we're only at the very early stages so i have no doubt that some of the things may be somewhat idiosyncratic to me but i think that when we get to that point where we have hundreds of people putting their testimony forward we're going to find much more consistency and overlap than we find divergence oh my goodness so so so many things here as well what a beautiful mr crystal really the difference between correspondence epistemology and coherence epistemology i mean the truth is born of coherence is the type of knowing that you're alluding to here but this begs the question of um aspirations around this and so pardon the tongue-in-cheek reference here but i was this came to me out of who knows where where you you know where do you see yourself in 20 years do you see yourself and again if you don't want to go here fine but um how do you see yourself are you a shaman for our age um do you see yourself uh and this is where the the play on word comes in not not establishing a uh the church of lds but the church of lsd right so do you see yourself not the latter day saints but you know lsd so do you see yourself do you see yourself um and i think you understand the heart of my question founding a church where in fact you know you you have a place where you can you now can create as a visionary as a revolutionary a holding environment a mandala container that can allow future psychonauts to actually embrace this as path because otherwise where is this going to go are you just a unique and really interesting blip or is are you portending the possibility of really creating a tradition of psychonauts using rigorous to whatever extent they can methodologies frameworks um i think you see where i'm coming from here you know what what's next in terms of people say somebody comes to you and says chris i'm so blown away by your book i want to take psychedelics as a practice i want to create this as a path what do i do where do i go well the first thing i tell that person always is please don't do what i did um do it gently be gentler be more careful uh i think i'm a symptom of a cultural pivot that we're making i don't think i'm important and as we make this cultural pivot i think i will just sort of disappear under the wave of history as a somewhat early explorer but i think we are making a pivot that's going to include and is embracing uh the value of psychedelics now right now you know we basically did about 25 years of this work and then in 1970 6970 it was all made illegal then we went into this long drive period until 2014 when scientific american published an editorial basically on the front page of the saying that it's time to let scientists determine not politicians determine whether psychedelics have therapeutic value so right now this is tremendous renaissance taking place universities all over the world are studying psychedelics they're establishing centers for studying psychedelics a tremendous explosion we're starting where we started back in the 1950s exploring these potentials for healing the personal psyche we're looking at post-traumatic stress healing addiction healing death anxiety healing depression we really focus on using these substances in therapeutic applications and under controlled scientific conditions and this is and that's perfectly where we ought to be we need to now that we've started this inquiry again we need to be very rigorous establish the protocols do the documentation look at the brainwave pictures so on and so forth sooner or later however we're going to discover the same thing we discovered far back and i'm not talking about the the popular 60s psychedelic movement though that too but the serious researchers the stan groff and that early generations ralph messner that generation of researchers discovered that these substances have philosophical value not just psychotherapeutic value they give us anti insights into the structure of the deep psyche they can even give us insights into the structure of the cosmos into the structural the cosmology of the mind and if we take phds who have people who have phds in physics and astronomers they can literally come back with deeper insights into the realities that they are that they're educated to understand i often have wished that i had phds in astronomy and physics because then i would be able to understand so much more than i was able to understand give in the background that i had in humanities we're making this pivot i think that just as psychotherapists are creating all sorts of creative protocols for exploiting the therapeutic potential of these substances it's only going to be a matter of time before we develop philosophical protocols which for systematically exploring these states of consciousness going into them in a rigorous manner coming back recording them evaluating them looking at our experiences in the in a social context for social validation or asking that question embodying putting our experiences in the context of other bodies of knowledge looking at how these experiences correlate to quantum physics for example or correlate to super string theory i think this is this is not me i'm i'm going to be gone 20 years hell i won't be around in 20 years i don't think i'll be around nearly that long i'll be gone and actually in two i i should say it took me a long time to even be willing to share these experiences because i know how upsetting or controversial they are i i literally thought of writing the book and letting it be published posthumously yeah exactly because i didn't want to deal with the fall out of it and i sort of haven't with wolfgang paulie in his conversation with carl jung right he didn't want any of that revealed until after he died but anyway i'm sorry i didn't mean to cut yeah and i just i thought but you know the mother told me said no you can't do that she said uh she said this is we need all oars in the water uh she said you didn't give yourself these visions we gave you those visions and they were never given to you for your private edification you were holding these visions and trust and that she wanted me to share them not because it's not important that they're my visions she wanted me to share them because they would support other people in their spiritual practice other people in their social work to help us through this very very intense time of history that we're coming into all hands on deck and so i did the book and i don't have any i don't have any agenda i think what's what's clear is that there is a social pivot taking place and that's what's important as we move forward collectively the work which is being done in graduate programs in medical schools all over the country that's what's important i think i'm a little bit ahead of the curve in terms of the philosophical discovery only because of the very very intense methodology that i used but i don't think i'm really that far ahead of the curve uh the there is a a professor from southern methodist university called bill barnard who's written two fantastic books one on william james and one on henri berkson a fine academic bill barnard and he's publishing a book from columbia university press this year called liquid light which basically is a philosopher's reflections on his extended experiences with ayahuasca and living with the sante dame community in brazil beautiful book magnificent book and symptomatic one more academic who's willing to go public on their psychedelic experiences and not simply recording them and saying oh this is you know what's important but evaluating them critically digesting them and offering them as part of an ongoing historical discussion so we're making this pivot it's it's happening and it's it's radically brave chris i want to acknowledge your bravery on this and again this is a stretch for for me because i'm being introduced over the last couple years to how conservative i am on some levels i always thought myself as this liberal far out kind of guy but i realized in my own way i had my i wouldn't say blind spots but natures of of being conservative that that really now being challenged stretched open and going wow this is fantastic and one of these is the the just the generous courage of writing a book like this because you know this from the traditional admonitions he who knows does not speak he who speaks does not know and so here you are you're speaking all over the place and i i used to really um question that and then you know the the beautiful book by media rinpoche if you haven't read it in love with the world amongst journey through the barna's life and death yeah it's an amazing journey of his intimate sharing that is profoundly inspiring your book vi in certain sense violates the code of secrecy but i think we're living in in unusual times that require unusual slash extreme measures and so i for one really applaud your courage that you are you are stretching the boundaries in so many levels in terms of pedagogy radical innovations and path and also courage and sharing and so you're about to say something i want to return to what you're about to say but i i i really deeply thank you for that because you know the tradition took uh said sharing experiences inappropriately and that's the key is like being in a dark cave with a candle and giving your candle away you're left in the dark opportunity is transformed into obstacle and so i i this is both an applause for what you're doing and perhaps a commentary elicited from you in terms of inviting more and more of the sharing so that people can realize there is a course of sanity coming out you know radical innovative ways of learning so yeah i had to really face resistance around that too because in buddhism traditionally you don't talk about your experiences you know you really don't talk about it it can become an encumbrance on you to talk about your experiences and um but you know i'm a teacher i love to teach i was designed to teach i'm a yakker i i i love to learn yeah you know i just that's what i love to do and as i said at the in that coming off the mountain chapter it wasn't simply the imbalance of toward transcendence which made me sick coming off the mountain it was the silence that i had to live with because as a philosopher of religion i had had the most powerful philosophical experiences of my life and i wasn't allowed to talk about them i wasn't allowed to share with them i wasn't allowed to do my job which and to do my job as an academic because of our phobia our laws around psychedelics and that holding that information literally makes you sick inside it you know i wasn't allowed to be who i truly am and writing the book was part of my own self-healing and beginning to speak about it as part of my own self-healing and at the same time having said that i have no agenda whatsoever i i'm not i have no pr i'm not trying to persuade anybody i i don't have an axe to grind i've got nothing to sell i'm i'm an old man you know i'm 72 years old the end of the diving board is getting close thank goodness this being that i am is so ephemeral is so short-lived i have i have no attachment to it and certainly no attachment of using it as a model of anything but i love to teach and i hope that the experiences will be useful to other people even if they never take any psychedelics whatsoever i hope that the vision of the universe and the the vision of the intelligence of the universe will resonate deeply with the people's inner experiences and their cognitive experiences as science becomes more aggressive in pushing its own boundaries but i hope it will speak to people whether or not they ever take any psychedelics um because i think we are at a pivot point we are just we're coming out of this terrible period of history where we believe that there's no intelligence to the universe it's all an accident that it's all a mechanistic rule of the genetic dice and there's no real intelligence to the existential circumstances that we confront and i think this is being exploded and we're waking up and suddenly where it's like a veil is being lifted we're waking up to a world in which reincarnation is a fundamental fact of life it's a fact of nature we're waking up to uh two truly an emergent intelligence in the universe which everywhere we look whether it's in the solar system in galaxies in the genetic code everywhere we look we are seeing orders and orders and orders of intelligence and this is simply accelerating that immersion into that intelligence uh and that opens up a whole new i think this is a pivot point that we're coming into and you know it couldn't happen a minute too soon because we are about to go extinct if we don't change it's it really reminds me uh chris of what the the ecology scientists talk about is punctuated equilibrium you know being similar similar similar similar similar and then they sudden flip yeah so in a certain way it's like what you said so beautifully in the book that gestation takes a long time birth happens quickly and so when i look at the 50 000 foot view what i'm seeing here is exactly what you're intimating that that correlative like the taoists say correlated with the dark is the emergence of light and in direct proportion to the insanity are voices of sanity coming in and so if we can relate it's like they say in tantra hell is paradise that the greater the obstacle the greater the opportunity in voices like yours and others that are actually coming up in this ocean of tremendous dark age talk about the kali yuga yeah we lend credibility to this co-emergent principle that if we simply look properly voices like yours and and others we're you're just part of a chorus of sanity coming up just of course and if we see that then we then we can it's all about right view isn't it like the buddhists say that if we simply have the right view that the greater the obstacle degree the opportunity then what you're talking about is adding to that kind of view and so i i don't want to draw too much of your time my friend i could talk to you for the rest of this day but with your permission there's just a few more things that oh my gosh i have to ask you sure one is and this is a little bit i mean it's philosophical but it's interesting for most people and i think this is for you as well when when we say oh that's just theoretical that's philosophical well maybe so simply because it's not your experience yet but when it becomes your experience it's no longer theory it's no longer philosophy it's your reality and so one of the things that you talk about that that again challenges both hindu and buddhist approaches to teleology purpose on one level as you know the tibetans talk about lila the world is just play um the tibetans talk about rolpa just this divine play and dance without directionality without purpose and so is it simply a matter of stepping out of binary modes of thinking that is either that or the other and switching to more what they call a dialethism this this the ability to hold um different views concurrently i think jung talked about this as well so talk to us a little bit about um the emerging human which implies purpose teleology ends the omega point i mean does that fit into your both your experience and your understanding of what you went through you know i i think when uh some the great masters talk about life is leela life is play creation is leela it's a dance i don't think they're saying of course in any frivolous way but i think what they're saying is not necessarily that life doesn't have an intelligence that is expressing itself in purposeful activity but they're saying that life isn't generated out of compulsion life is not generated out of necessity that life comes out of the fullness of being it comes out of the excess of being it doesn't come out of a deficit of being and that there's an exuberant quality to life and we express this exuberant quality in this metaphor of a dance because dance is not compelled we dance out of joy we dance out of an excess we don't dance out of necessity i think the i think when i you know the theme of the future human the emergence of the future human was a completely unexpected uh theme in my work and it was one of the most consistent themes of the work and it became the context within which everything else took place and it eventually became the context in which i understood my entire incarnation to be taking place it started in the 23rd session and it the last time i encountered it was in the 70th session it was a consistent thing and it is and here i would just suspend any theistic notions of mechanistic intention or purposeful intent or manipulative intent i i don't think in those categories uh i i would hold on to an emergent understanding of a cosmology that there is an innate quality which is emerging we go through these punctuated equilibriums these these crisis points and that there is a a genius at work in this which i don't begin to understand the you know how this works what i will report is that in my sessions when i dissolved into this larger intelligence which existentially i was part of but cosmologically was much larger than anything i could relate to personally it was it told me a story over and over again and it laid it out systematically layer by layer without contradiction over years that humanity was coming to a turning point humanity was approaching a critical time in its evolutionary journey a true before and after time that there that the the the karma of of millennia was kind of rushing into this valley it's like multiple rivers pouring into a canyon there's nowhere for us to go except up this is a critical time and that and it is a time in some way foreseen by the great seers of history by the great saints by the great spiritual geniuses of of history the by the great incarnations the great prophets uh the great awakened ones that they that they have seen this kind of coming forward it's a vision which is shared by indigenous peoples that we are coming into this time and then 55 sessions 15 years or so into the work now i have to back a bit time became very porous to me in my work i mean i was taken beyond linear time multiple times in many different modalities into what i call deep time deep time is not eternity it's not it's not timelessness it's experiencing different spans of time from within a different frame of reference and i was taken into deep time and i was taken into it not as chris beige because chris bash had been dissolved long before and i had been dissolved into the human unconscious into the human species mind and i don't know whether it was because of the work that i had given in the ocean of suffering whatever it was i was taken into the future and experienced what i saw what i experienced as the death and rebirth of humanity as the human species a cataclysmic period of history in which humanity was literally just broken down we lost control we were we were put through a crushing historical process where all the all the assumptions of the past broke down we were literally brought to our knees we were reduced in the end to the challenge of mere survival it's just we were stripped down it was a terribly excruciating experience but when it was at its worst when it was at its peak it was like a hurricane that passes over a pacific island suddenly i began to experience it things were beginning to get better things were beginning we there were many many people that died but many survived and the storm began to pass we began to pick ourselves up we began to reconnect and as we did when we did we discovered that we had been changed this crisis had changed us at our core we began to enact a a living intelligence an aliveness that we had discovered in the worst of this crisis it was like this crisis opened up our hearts and made us a more compassionate species and it opened up our mind making us a more intelligent species able to integrate and access information from the intelligence of the universe itself as we began to reconnect with each other we began there was a snowballing effect so that just as there had been a breaking down and breaking down and breaking down there was an acceleration of creativity an acceleration of the actualization of values that we had discovered in the worst of this crisis where everything felt new everything there was a new set of values a new set of ideas a new political reality emerged a new social reality emerged later i was given more instructions on the mech some of the mechanisms that are involved and instructions and teachings on that this is a shift which is taking place at the center of the collective psyche without going into too many layers of the discussion now this is not simply a shift in the political arena or the social arena or economic arena it is a shift in the core substructure of the human psyche a shift in the architecture of the collective psyche and we've been just as we collect all our experiences over many incarnations at the soul level the human species has been collecting and integrating its experiences at the collective level at the unconscious collective psyche level and what's happening now is that we are pivoted we're poised to make a pivot in the collective psyche and that after we make this pivot all human beings born will be operating within the context of a literally of a different collective psyche and i think we see the prototype of this psyche in christ in buddha in muhammad in these awakened beings who we have been trying to emulate for generations and generations beings with expanded hearts with expanded compassion with expanded deeper insights into the universe whose they speak differently they don't work the way ordinary people work they are different kinds of being and i think we are becoming a different kind of being at least that's the consistent message that comes through my work over and over again it's literally breathtaking chris a few uh with your confirmation i have to bring you back at some point yeah because you haven't i wouldn't say we haven't gotten to the goodies oh my gosh it's been so rich but your chapter on the diamond luminosity blew my socks off your chapter on coming from down from the mountain was brought me to tears i have to bring you back to talk about that because i don't want to dilute the impact of what you're saying by trying to do a shotgun of i mean how do you distill 20 years of unbelievable insight to even two hours of conversation and so to whatever extent i've been able to i wanted to concentrate on a couple heart essence points add a little water to them so we could understand them without capitulating to my near frenetic predisposition to like oh my gosh i have to talk to him about this right we'd be going you're doing a great job you're hitting really important topics we'd be going at this mock one but i wanted there's a couple things before we close for today that i want to return to that that i think are somewhat important at least they are to me um and two things here one is your journey seems to imply or a type of um attainment in other words we you're alluding to extraordinary states and i'm not contesting that at all but i'm wondering if if the languaging the branding so some of the things that that occurred to me using somewhat marketing methods is one thing that needs to happen is this whole thing needs to be rebranded this whole lsd thing the branding thing is is really so contaminated with histories that we need to rebrand it as anthogenic practice or whatever but the other thing that needs perhaps to be rebranded and this is just me i'm curious how this lands with you is there seems to be this intimation that you have a left conventional reality at one level you have and attain these states they're extraordinary but is is it in fact chris just as viable if not more so to say that this is the extraordinary state in other words this is the non-ordinary state samsara and that what you're actually doing in your journey is is and this is a narrative that keeps coming over and over i loved it the narrative of opening receiving surrendering and and maybe for next time not only opening the uh the mind but just as much again in terms of languaging the unbelievable importance of opening the body and so as a consequence of opening and you mentioned this so many times i was curious how how often you said this dropping you open you drop so it's not a journey of ascent so much as it is awaking down into really what are ordinary states that that when you relax properly and have the capacity to be so open what you're talking about is completely ordinary that you're not really going anywhere you're simply relaxing deeply into the right here and out and so the reason i say this chris is because one thing that that i think could be a little bit intimidating for people is oh my gosh i can never do that i could never attain that that's so far removed i think if if you look at it in this different way and i'm curious if this lands with you it empowers the immediacy of what you're talking about that that fundamentally this is the nature of the mind this is the nature of the human and even trans human condition and so talk to us a little bit about the the almost the false note the false notion of path because even the notion of path needs to be rebranded here because that implies you need to go somewhere else and then the very striving you actually ironically leave what you're trying to attain yeah really a whole notion of like you attain enlightenment that's actually an oxymoron you cannot attain enlightenment they're mutually exclusive terms so a lot of noodles against the wall but i think important ones because it also ties into the last thing i wanted to say here is you you also use the phrase a number of times of coming and going in other words you enter the state you left it you entered it you left it that also means a return to some kind of source so i'm wondering about the relationship here again i know i'm tossing a lot out the relationship between source and essence in the relationship of all this to recognition it is in fact recognition not the central message here that if you simply open your mind and heart irrespective of the means meditative pharmacological or whatever if you simply open and recognize everything that seems to be intimated here is oh geez i need to do this 20-year journey to attain this provisionally maybe yes but absolutely no it's right here right now you just need to open your eyes divine eyes and it's been here all along yeah i absolutely agree with you um in fact well let me back up and there's a lot here i'm sorry yeah in the early stages of the journey there is a subjective sense as one moves into psychic level reality and subtle level reality there is a subjective sense of opening becoming larger opening and becoming larger and that's why i think psychedelics were named mind opening it is a sensation of opening the mind late in the journey later at a more advanced stage when i was working at what stan would call causal level reality yeah we can as well yeah everything reversed i had the experience that uh my mind everything was converging i was in very very large states of re consciousness very very high energy but instead of going deeper into those states all everything was converging back to right here right now my my sessions were getting harder to describe because they they were so taking place inside ordinary reality i wasn't being taken outside everything was converging and i began to think oh my god have we really misclassified what these substances are they're not mind openers they're mind concentrators absolutely absolutely and i think what happens is at different levels of reality the subjective experience changes from opening to a concentration or it may be the case that the consciousness orchestrating my experience was bringing me back into what would more be recognized as a more classical kind of spiritual awakening but the core is that it's really simply the case a sashim is you turn your mind and you focused on the present you you eliminate the outside and you go right here right now and when you do that this purification process happens of course but where you end up at the end is simply where you were in the beginning but with fewer distortions yes elliot yeah and you're just cleaning you're cleaning the macchio you're cleaning the distortions but there's no place to go there's no place else to go to except where you already are and there's nothing to become except what you already are and always have been you don't you know that reality which doesn't begin it doesn't end there's no turning on there's no turning off there is only the relaxing into what has always been right here right now yeah and i think that's that is true on at least it was true in my experience on the psychedelic path i don't think anything that i'm describing is original i think everything that i've described in the book can be found in the spiritual literature of the mystical traditions the contemplative traditions the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic research is not a new cosmology it's an old cosmology it's it's only new in the context of its emergence and it leaves you i say you know in somewhere in the end stages of the book like the only thing which is of value to me in the psychedelic work is purification purification and just purification bri and it because it brings us into a more intimate experience of what already is and by some silly nonsense we keep ourselves out of the joy of this deep and profound reality that is living in us that is us that is expressing itself so i absolutely agree with you yeah it's yeah it's just purifying that's all and again not that this brings validity to what you're saying other than the validity to my world is we come and learn and understand things in terms of other things yeah and a logical knowing and so what brought such deep deep resonance was wow here's an amazing individual who's taken an entirely new path that is so resonant with my path and and again completely aware of the hubris of saying my breath be tokens the truth and therefore yours is true because it relates to mine right this little subtle self-aggrandizement there is actually not so subtle right i think your stuff is true because it resonates with my trip totally aware of that yeah but with that said um there's so many resonances the the notion of purification as you know you're and this is what the question i wanted to ask you um how as we start to close up for today one of the the chapters or sections that really spoke to me of course um somewhat um preview by what i just said was your interjection of the path of vajrayana that and how that is now perhaps create creating a again a holding environment to support augment transition in more and this i you understand hopefully the question in more organic means more phenomenological versus neurological means so-called traditional methods um yeah and so as we start to wrap up for today because i want to give people something to take home like how can they use this work with this and i have one follow-up there but what has been the role and continues to be the role of both meditation and the vajrayana to augment support enhance stabilize what you've gone through well one of the gifts that came out of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation of the power and effectiveness of classic spiritual contemplative practices and including the vajrayana practices uh by becoming sort of temporarily more aware i was able to appreciate more deeply how these practices were affecting my body and how they were affecting my mind even though and they also helped me manage some of the challenges that i was running into because remember i wasn't doing this or i didn't end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening though that was always there in the background but i was doing it to explore the universe as a philosopher hungary to explore the nature of reality but the vajrayana practices helped me manage the excess of energy that was having with being flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe that was like in between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence there was this vadriana practice space that of course taught me that these power these practices are much more powerful than i had appreciated or i might have appreciated just from working with them from my ordinary time space consciousness i also came to appreciate that these practices are empowered by the morphic fields which have been generated by thousands and thousands of beings doing these practices for hundreds and hundreds of years the power of transmission the lung when a practice is given it's not just to maintain the formal purity the practice but there truly is an energetic transmission and the power of this practice draws upon the cumulative power that is set in motion by thousands of beings using these practices over many many years now i don't know whether to describe myself as a vajrayana practitioner today [Music] because while i do practice and i do meditate um the focus of my practice is different and in some ways the focus of my practice is actually speaking there is a way in which wow when i speak about these things i remember them when i remember them they become actualized within me when they become actualized within me my mind shifts my body shifts everything shifts inside of me and so actually for me this wonderful discussion that we've been having and i really really appreciate the the the deep engaged quality of the questions you've been asking me and where you've been taking us for me this is like a spiritual practice for me your questions give me the opportunity to open in ways that i wouldn't ordinary i wouldn't be open in today otherwise in that context uh as part of my ongoing effort to simply to be useful to the universe i practice i do my practices but i don't practice with the intention of trying to accomplish something and i don't practice with the intention of changing what's going to happen to me when i die now it may be arrogant to say this but i just report that i have a sense of what's going to open to me when i die because i've been there i've been there in different ways been there done that right and the universe has has made promises to me and i don't think the promises are false i think they're just very matter-of-fact and so i don't practice in order to change what's going to happen to me when i die i practice to change how i am right now and to try to be of more use to people right now so to kind of declare my system to clear my system uh to remember yeah and i used my psychedelic memories in my vajrayana practice you know in vajrayana you there's the samaya saatva and the jananasatha the the being of practice which attracts the being of reality and so we do these visualizations and exercises and mudras in order to create something which is an approximation of an eternal principle by virtue of which we draw that principle into our being well i use my memories as samaya saatva in the creation of samayasatva in order to open the channels to the jananasatha of these principles in reality you know and that to me is just this is a this is a natural process so it i do the vajrayana practices but i do them with my own particular kind of twist and understandably it's hard to find a teacher who is comfortable with somebody who's owns the psychedelic history the way mine yeah and maybe maybe that needs to um change and adapt i mean and who are we to say that talk about the arrogance of that because as you know chris and i'm so glad to hear you say this there actually have been in the wisdom traditions admonitions a warning against originality that's very interesting to me that that originality is somewhat suspicious and i i i find that a very interesting statement on one level yes it it it abides by the elegance the beauty of the tradition and the one level the sort of irreducible irreducibility of the awaken mind that's already been discovered and i think if it's a related to properly that can prevent rogue um messiahs on the like but on another level if we don't evolve we're going to go extinct if we don't bring we meaning the wisdom traditions as a representative of if we don't bring new tributaries of upaya skillful means cultural adaptations to perennial traditions then i think it's not going to be applicable to the modern age and it's just going to be relegated to the dusty dispense in in dust bins in in old stale churches but um well just a couple of things here before we we close because i don't want to take more advantage of your time but we started with this notion or i did with this notion of hyper objects um top uh issues topics phenomena that are so big it's hard to wrap one's mind around that that you know i always say stretching is good for growth this has been a journey of a mental yoga yeah and i'm wondering if is it too ostentatious to talk about and i so appreciate your your humility your modesty but there's also tremendous power that you're releasing that you are a shaman to that you are expressing and i so appreciate i've never really related to this is is also speaking as practice dialogue is practice engaging in what we're doing here is path that's really beautiful but would you say or is it fair to say that you're also pointing towards and this connects to your book the living classroom hyper pedagogy are you in fact intimating a possibility for accelerated forms of learning and i resonate with this deeply because when i explore what i call the nocturnal meditations dream yoga and the like one of the reasons i'm so passionate about these practices is because they are a revolution in pedagogy it's a way to use the mind and the nocturnal arena to really accelerate learning because you're working with these foundational dimensions and so is it fair to say based on what your experience that what you're also pointing to are possibilities for hyper-pedagogical approaches where we can in fact accelerate our evolution if it's held within the right view within the right setting setting with on the right container that we can really ramp things up in a healthy way with a but again with the bodhisattva ideal and the motivations and all the parameters of safety and security because the faster you go this is the net the essence of the majoriana it's a jet versus a car jets can crash cars are safer but they're slower is that a fair thing to say that if we relate to this properly what you're also pointing out here is not only just hyper objects but hyper pedagogical approaches i think so yeah you know in the living classroom i don't mention psychedelics at all i wanted this book to be about fields of consciousness and the effects of feels on learning and the the accelerating effect of focused intentionality and energetic transmission that takes place in the classroom or in any group context and i don't talk about psychedelics at all but the back story to that book is this i was doing my private psychedelic so-called private psychedelic practice i was opening up into the ocean of suffering i was going into these very very deep collective states of consciousness and eventually into deeper you know transcendent states of consciousness i never talked to my students about it but i found that my students began to be impacted by my work in very precise ways when i was going through certain thresholds they began to go through certain spiritual thresholds and it began to happen when i was lecturing nothing to do with psychedelics just lecturing on world religions just something and i would be looking for some example to use to make a point and i experienced a door open in the back of my mind the way it first happened and this little piece of paper slipped into it i read the piece of paper and it was an idea of something to use and i i tried it and when i tried it all of a sudden the energy in the room shifted and everything became more animated and i began to work consciously with these kind of subtle suggestions that would pop into my mind from seemingly nowhere and then a few years down the road students started to come to me and they said at the end of class you know it's strange that you said what you said today or gave this example because this is exactly what happened to me this week or this is exactly what happened to my mother and at first i dismissed it i thought okay but it kept happening and it kept happening and the deeper my psychedelic practice went it began to happen more but it also began to touch deeper areas of their life it was as if their soul was slipping messages to my soul which was slipping it to me leading me to say things that were giving them information or touching very intimate places in their life that i had no way of personally knowing about experiences that places that they needed healing are information that they needed to take the next step in their learning and this was became such a characteristic part of my teaching so many people were being moved in ways that were beyond my conscious intention and even beyond my awareness when it was happening and a pivot point came when i i looked at my class one day while i was lecturing and i looked up and i saw a half dozen ten people in the room with very quietly tears rolling down their face and i realized i've got to understand what's happening i i really have to understand this and that's the entire book living classroom was downloaded in 10 minutes in one session the entire just dropped right in and i've been wrestling with this idea that but it gave me all the information i need to understand two basic points but all of the both of them hinge around the fundamental reality that consciousness has an atomic quality a separate quality and it has a quantum quality so there is individual awareness and individual awareness is true they don't know what i know they're here to get what i know we give a test and i can test whether they have it you know that kind of stuff but there's a quantum reality that my individual experience is grounded in a quantum in a an expansive field of consciousness and they are grounded in this expansive field of consciousness and that activates potentials which are entirely natural it's like throwing a stone into the water into a lake and the ripple spread out when one person does deep clarifying work it triggers clarification in the consciousness of people that they have karmic connection to it's a simple simple natural phenomenon so i think what i eventually wrote down and and clarified was what would it be like if we taught consciously in a transpersonal pedagogy or in an integral pedagogy or in a pedagogy that recognized the the innate interconnectivity of consciousness which doesn't mean that we abandon the individual strategies that we know and work so well but we incorporate using strategies of focused intentionality of uh of conscious of conscious engagement that goes beyond classical teaching so that for example you know should as soon adriana practice it's a purification practice yep and i'd learned should and i was doing should for my spiritual practice i began before class even began when i would get a roster of the students for my class i would start incorporating this roster in my should practice i would literally pray for my students using this particular vehicle i would pray for them and i pray for them through the entire course for their well-being not i don't try to it's not my job to think i know what's right for them or what they should be doing or anything like that i simply pray for their well-being i think the more we kind of activate these latent potentials in groups the more we accelerate learning and i found it's not only the there's not only a collective field in the room but there is a class field but even deeper than that is the course field that there is a learning and empowerment that takes place over years so that the students you have the individual mind situated within a class mine situated within a coarse mind this is an absolute once you see it once you understand it you begin to recognize it happening in all sorts of different contexts in different places so if there is a hyper object the hyper object is simply the connective tissue of mind it's that we are always always inherently connected and we simply become conscious of that and become responsible to it yeah in whatever we're doing yeah and again it's back to that narrative of making unconscious process these processes and making unconscious processes conscious because if you can do that then you can increase levels of communication elicitation evocative um whatever to then then really heighten that what is what is already again it's already there so why not take advantage of it why not engage it why not make it bring it into conscious awareness pay allegiance to it surrender to it and therefore enhance it accelerate it in and of itself and so chris i i want to pay homage to your time just a few last things the famous last words wait a second one more thing it'll be midnight oh wait chris one more thing this is fun i i mean i literally i could talk to you for the entire day but to wrap it up for now um people are what you're releasing here is a pandora's box of both wisdom and potential neurosis and by this what i mean is um i wonder if you worry about what you've released here because here's here's a little bit of where i want to close with this is i can i'm definitely here or imagine listeners going this is for me i i this is my path i want to do this and and and they may see this as a quick fix as a lazy man's approach and of course your book shows this is not for the feeble-minded or the feeble-hearted you have to this is jihad this is inner dharma combat you have to really go to work here so what would you say like dharmic surgeons general's warning these teachings are hazardous to your egoic health right so i want to throw a little bit of a caveat to listeners who go oh heck i don't need to go into retreat i don't need to do a three-year retreat i can just pop these pills and and i'm going to attain these states and i knew there was a quick silver bullet this is it so you understand it's a slightly extreme rendering of this but people climb under these sorts of things and they're going to run into them run with them with wrong motivation with wrong intent so talk to us as we close here several things um and this also ties into my experience i have not done this yet but i've talked to people who've done ios good retreats in costa rica they go down there they have these mind-blowing experiences over four or five uh planned medicine trips and then they leave and then they they tell me i know these people they go it was great but i don't feel supported they don't follow up with me i'm left completely to my own devices i am like what do i do with that yeah so as we close for today again lots of noodles because this topic is just so rich talk to us about like if someone came to you [Music] would you act as an advisor or are there advisors they can be drawn to do you take responsibility for this pandora's box of wisdom that you're releasing what are the shadow sides of doing this without proper sentence setting and so i know i'm trying to close but i can't help myself i think this is important we have to throw some uh caveats out there for those who may be thinking that ah this is the long-awaited spiritual silver bullet i'll just pop these things and i'm good to go yeah boy no silver bullet there are there are no shortcuts in this particular match that's what i've learned there are no shortcuts there are intensifications of practice but there's no getting around the fundamental laws of spiritual reality you know that there's just no getting around them and the early idea that psychedelics represented an easy path uh it just turned out to be facile and not true in fact my concern is just the opposite my concern is that if you use these substances even conscientiously they are they can be so intense that uh it's too demanding a path it's it's just too demanding you have to really really be wise in the in the handling of it um [Music] i'm i was very concerned in sharing this material because it would break my heart if someone were to read my book and then jump into some type of use of psychedelics and injure themselves and it's easy to injure yourselves because you you open you can open so deeply so quickly that you really can't handle everything that comes at you and you can you can disrupt a healthy psyche in ways that can be permanently crippling it it would break my heart if somebody did that and i i did a lot of practice a spiritual practice around that particular issue what we're learning is that breaking through breaking the boundaries of the personal psyche going into deeper states of consciousness is really not that difficult it's it's really not that hard we're beginning to see more and more attention being given to integration the the requirements of integration what constitutes a healthy practice and i offer myself as an example of someone whose practice was not entirely healthy i would think i went too deep and it's cost me years of of kind of i won't say distress but years of having to manage the joy that i had temporary that i knew on a temporary basis so and in it one of the reasons i left the suffering i you know i didn't blunt the suffering in the book there were people who were advising me don't put that in because people are not going to get scared they're not going to understand it one of the reasons i put it in just because it was true and i promised to give it an accurate account but i put it in partly because i wanted people to be able to understand how this stuff works how understands it they are amplifiers amplifiers brings up our garbage it brings up our trash we have to confront that garbage confront that trash but even when we do that and do that well we still have to manage the the wisdom of integration there is a book that was just published this past year in england it's inner tradition press psychedelics and psychotherapy and the focus of this book is really on integration and i have an essay in there with other people my essay is called the challenge of integrating an extreme psychedelic journey not simply in a psychedelic session but an extreme psychedelic journey i think we need more essays like that we need more discussions about what is good what does healthy psychedelic practice look like what are the symptoms of imbalance in psychedelic practice what is the symptom of too much people chasing new experiences before they've integrated the experiences that they've had i've seen many students suffering they've literally fried themselves and their energy feels very fried they've gone back to the well too many times they've plugged into the universe at too high a level and they haven't stayed grounded they're they they feel kind of crispy they have paid a price and some people truly have paid a price of uh dysphoria and various types of imbalance psychological imbalance from entering into these states so the problem is you see that our culture doesn't have a wisdom in the use of psychedelics some indigenous cultures do the shamanic cultures do have that wisdom we have to learn from them how to use these practices wisely right now we're using these practices within a therapeutic arena and we we're drawing upon our therapeutic wisdom of how to integrate these healing practices well but as we go deeper we have to go beyond therapeutic wisdom we have to go into shamanic wisdom we have to go into the sage tradition wisdoms to really learn how to integrate these practices well having deep experiences turns out is not that difficult and it's not necessarily very beneficial it doesn't have a long lasting effect julianna of norwich english mystic had one she was on her deathbed she was dying she had a near-death experience she had an experience of the love of christ and she had an experience of of the feminine god she spent the rest of her life meditating on it and she unpacked one experience in her book the revelations of divine love it takes years to unpack the full potential that's unleashed in even one experience so it would there we have a lot to learn hopefully we will be wiser in this century with psychedelics than we were in the last century in the 1960s where we did a lot of psychedelics we had a lot of experiences a lot of breakthroughs a lot of cat some casualties not as many as popular press would have us believe but did we change people's lives profoundly and permanently some yes but not as many as we thought would we would i think we need to really be wise and grounded in our reappropriation of psychedelics do you worry about what you've released i mean one one thing that comes to mind here is i i spent a lot of time in the himalayas i've trekked above everest base camp i've seen a lot of high altitude sickness and and so on one level that's what this is like it's like i've seen this where when you're climbing to everest you've got to spend two days in namche bazaar for instance at 12 000 feet to acclimatize and the people that don't that don't acclimatize and go up they're the ones that get high altitude cerebral or pulmonary edema and run into very serious problems and then the way they have to cure it as you know you get a headache you stop you go back down you retreat to an altitude where the symptoms were not there and then you slowly work your way up otherwise the high altitude sickness your lust for the summit will kill you so do you sometimes worry chris about again what you release because on one level this ties in so beautifully i think to what we said it when i said the outside because that's why it's beautiful because i said it is this is a form of tantra and it's interesting yes i i just wrote an article for tarka is the west ready for tantra and as a form of tantra as you know there are practices that are prescription strength tumo uh dark retreat there are practices that are does not design for public consumption because they're too powerful you're you're you're dealing with thermonuclear power as it's embodied in your subtle body and so you what you're talking about here is the danger of what's called salon practice in our yoga practice where the the condensed um impact of your entire cosmic history is encountered in your body and subtle body and so when you're doing something like this as the danger with doing inner yogas and this is what your book screamed out to me i said oh my gosh chris is doing inner yoga here and this is why not only is he opening his mind he's opening his body and as the channels wins chakras are open and released whoa if you can't ride that wind you're going to be blown away by that wind and so i see this as a absolutely confluent with these prescription strength contract practices yeah if you're not done with the proper motivation proper sentence setting really intelligently they're not going to light you up they're going to burn you up and so again lots of things being thrown out there but i think this is really important especially in the impatient west where people people are going to go i'm just going to run with this yeah do you worry about you worry about what you've been there so to speak or worry about it uh i made first of all that i do worry about it um [Music] it's i'm glad we're talking about it i hope i get opportunities to talk more about it it needs to be discussed the relationship between this high potency psychedelic as a spiritual practice but also as a in this you know initiatory practice and the practices that you're talking about as initiatory practices they can burn you up uh i got rather well singed and you know had to manage them have had to manage them yeah the other side of it is the mother asked me she said you know we did not give you these visions for you we gave them for the people she said let them see me through your eyes just just let me see let them see me through your eyes as you have seen me and it's like i am not important what's important is what was shown me and i i hope that by sharing that cleanly and honestly it will help people in their own spiritual development that is my fundamental conviction my fundamental motivation as a philosopher i trust my students to deal with the information that i make available to them even when it jars their system even when it upsets their cultural worldview i work with them to make sure that they don't get pushed too hard that they integrate them this is something that's a little different this isn't a way i've said something i've not set it in motion it's happening all around me i'm simply one voice which is part of a psychedelic revolution it's just one voice trying to bring some clarity on one certain set of issues i should also mention that i made a choice a long time ago uh not to function as a therapist not to function as a clinician but to function as an explorer i do not work with other people i do not work as a therapist i do not take people in psychedelic sessions i don't do that work that's a different set of skills it requires training that i don't have i work with people who are training to be those people and there are lots and lots of places where people are training to work as psychedelic elders and as psychedelic therapists and i'm in conversations with some of these training groups i'll be doing one this coming weekend in fact but i i've made a choice to really work as an explorer and to bring a report back and to support other people who are working as clinicians who are really trying to help people use this material wisely now as i said i think right now we're learning the wisdom in the therapeutic context we still have to learn that wisdom incorporate that wisdom into the shamanic the shamanic wisdom and to support integrate the wisdom that comes from the sage tradition different levels of depth i just trust that we will find that wisdom i hope there are not casualties or not too many casualties along the way in that process i do worry about it i trust i just in the end i have to trust that we will find the wisdom to do this now my sense is we're going there no matter what psychedelics are here they're not going away they didn't go away during the 40 years of prohibition they're not going away now what we need to do is accelerate and deepen our understanding of how to what they are how they work and how to work with them well what they do and don't give us and in my book i've really tried to emphasize the underbelly of psychedelics that they are temporary that my chapter on methodology is the path of temporary immersion that's not the same as the path of contemplative immersion you really have to work with those limitations and understand them to work with them safely and they are powerful and i i really mean it i don't recommend that people work with high doses of lsd as consistently and methodically as i did i wouldn't do it that way again i would be gentler with myself i would open up smaller windows gentler substances lower doses precisely because of the challenge of sustaining the impact how these experiences impact you not only in the days immediately following your session but in the years following your session yeah you know so interesting uh chris you talked earlier about um and this is a wonderful definition of a translation of shannata emptiness is translucency transparency and one on one level you are the exemplar of that transparency there's no difference between the inner and outer with you and and to me it's really quite beautiful to see and i also have to share a little bit of the magic that i'm feeling um even in the conversation itself that that and i hope my listeners take this in the right way some of these questions are not coming from me i i can tell when i'm asking a question but i can also tell when these questions aren't coming for me and so this next one did not come from me um and i hope it's okay to ask this in relationship to the beloved to the mother um do you ever feel and do you ever feel that you were brought into this world on behalf of the mother to act as her child luminosity to act as that voice i mean do you ever um look at your trajectory as actually being a kind of avatar of the mother itself that you were brought to again this idea of of purpose and and divine purpose and teleology does that does that speak to you around this or do you feel this is a little bit more sort of serendipitous uh i mean another way you could say this in my languaging is to what degree is karma predispose you towards this but more specifically using your languaging do you think the beloved sent her child into this world right now we're getting really christian here man right yeah tongue and cheek aside i think you i hope you see where i'm coming from i think that before i answer the specific i want to answer the general i think that many of us at first i i believe that we all knew what we were getting into before we incarnated we have choices to make and we choose our incarnation now we may not choose it if we're if we're kindergarteners we don't let them choose their curriculum but by the time you're in high school and college and graduate school you're choosing your curriculum and i think that this is true about reincarnation too we choose our incarnation we choose the form of it we choose the timing of it we choose the place of it we knew at a time when we knew more than we know now what we're getting into we said yes to the options of of this incarnation so i think this is the lives that we are living are for the most part for the vast majority i think are chosen lives okay and i think this is true for me and i don't think i certainly don't think i'm a you know an ishtar for the for the mother but i have always considered myself in service of the mother i'm in it's in my astrological chart it's in my constitutional chart i i wanted to be you know my first vocation in life was to be a priest i woke up when i woke up at five or six years old i wanted to be a priest and i was raised catholic and that's how it expressed itself um but that fell away but the desire to serve the desire to know and to serve was always there as it is for many of us and so i also learned along the way uh not in my psychedelic work but actually in some hypnotic work i was doing in past life therapy work that i have history with psychedelics i have native american history with psychedelics it's what made me comfortable with this mode of spiritual practice so i i believe that i was born to do what i did and that's that's not inflationary that's just it's just very simple this this is what i did what came naturally to him uh and it's no big deal it's just what is uh i love to teach just so happened that it took a little bit of a twist and i'll add one other little small piece there's been great benefit to me in this in that i also learned that i have had a number of lives where i paid a price for speaking i was tortured and killed for speaking out and so i i was internalized i i brought that resistance in this lifetime and it's not been easy from the first time i wrote on reincarnation i had to overcome great resistance but what i found was that by overcoming that resistance and speaking the truth as best as i could understand it it always worked out well it always i was always richly rewarded for the process so there's been soul learning for me and rising to the challenge of doing this it's not been easy to write about psychedelics in our particular culture but look at the the friendships that it's given me the context it has given me the opportunities to be with people has been very rewarding and i think i think there are a lot lots and lots and lots of people who are like me like yourself who have deep deep spiritual hunger spiritual drive and they they do it and as they get into it they're not holding this just for themselves they are truly bodhisattvas they're doing this practice for everybody first thing you do in a practice awaken bodhichitta and the last thing you do in your practice is you distribute the merit you know this is this is just the nature of reality this is just the very simple process of waking up to the true condition which is a shared existence that we all that we all embody yeah breathtaking breathtaking chris really um how can people learn more about you again i'm going to i'm probably going to say one more thing and we're going to be here until midnight um but how can people learn more about you um what are you currently working on how can we support you part part of what we do my aspiration is cross-pollination is bringing bringing this chorus of sanity so that we can increase connectivity enhance the connective tissue um strengthen it and into whatever degree possible at whatever levels of reality overt or covert support each other so how can my community learn more about you support you in your journey and what are you currently working on that we can look forward yeah well it's very kind of you uh to ask that i just finished uh teaching a seven-week course at the shift network which is basically a seven week course built around lsd in the mind of the universe and that course is now um is available and people can get that course and download it and there's an hour lecture followed by half an hour q a and you know there's material there and there's also readings there that they can go into uh i have a website chrisbash.com it's unfinished but it's there and if you want to get access to some of my talks or some of the things i've written they're there uh i don't do a bulletin um i am right now uh still absorbing uh the feedback from the course i did with the shift network i probably will do some more teaching with them uh i will probably be having conversations like we're having now for people who want to have the kind of conversations that flow out of critical psychedelic practice and with a spiritual twist to it i look forward when covid allows us to gather together in groups to do retreats i happen to live outside of asheville where there are lots of retreat centers around here and i hope that there'll come a time when people can gather we can gather physically for long weekend or week-long retreats where we can just enter into the discussion uh more deeply i don't have any immediate plans for that i'm just i live kind of in a responsorial mode uh you wanted to have a conversation i'm delighted to have this conversation but i just ought to wait until things come to me uh and we'll take it from there beautiful beautiful well chris i just like with your book you're i'm left with just this um perfume this this sense of awe and wonder it it really the magic and mystery of the entire affair the the surrender to some whatever you want a pen hyper object i mean that's a silly not a silly word but a shrink wrap word for the inf ability the the elegance the beauty the magic of this world and your your presence really embodies to me and that's why so much i wanted to do this not just merely audit audit um with audit auditory means but also visual means is you're doing something right right you're doing something right and your your mere presence conveys the the kind of authenticity if i may be so presumptuous of what you've done and what you've elected to be is your path and we are the beneficiaries of your the diamonds that you're throwing across this planet and so on behalf of my community really thank you for taking time out of your busy life to spend um some time with us and i'm just left somewhat breathless um taking the insights that you shared it's really truly deeply inspiring and i don't paper these words out lightly it's really mind-bending mind-blowing and what a tremendous gift your courage and your beauty has brought to this world so deep deep thanks my friend until until next time i'm really touched andrew thank you very much and um thank you for your work thank you for the goodness that you're spreading for the for the ideas that you're seeding and it's really been an honor to be in conversation with you today thank you my words and maybe we can do it again in this dimension or another so all the best until next time my friend sounds good okay much love</p>

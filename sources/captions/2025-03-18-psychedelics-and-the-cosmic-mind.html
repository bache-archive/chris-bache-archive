<p>Now I'll switch over to the internet video. Welcome, Chris. It's a great joy to have</p>
<p>you with me on New Thinking Allowed today. Thank you, Amy. It's a pleasure to be here. Today,</p>
<p>we're going to discuss your deep exploration of yourself, your own spiritual journey and into</p>
<p>the cosmic mind. When you had 73 LSD sessions between the years of 1979 to 1999, and you</p>
<p>outlined that in your book, LSD in the Mind of the Universe. Before we get into all that you</p>
<p>experienced and what you gleaned and learned from those sessions, can we just begin with</p>
<p>talking a little bit about what you've noticed in the last, oh, I don't know, 10 plus years</p>
<p>or more where it seems that the taboo related to psychedelics seems to be shifting. The</p>
<p>types of psychedelics there are out there and what their uses are for, not each one,</p>
<p>but sort of overall why people do this. And today we're going to focus on</p>
<p>specifically the cosmic exploration of them. Well, as you know, there</p>
<p>is a worldwide renaissance of research taking place in psychedelics.</p>
<p>At the forefront of that research is the focus on therapeutic healing. That's what's bringing</p>
<p>psychedelics back into the intellectual and clinical community. The capacity of these</p>
<p>amplifying substances to bring forward the personal unconscious and to unearth the wounds</p>
<p>of the personal unconscious and to assist and deepen and accelerate people's healings of trauma</p>
<p>and various issues, post-traumatic stress, depression, things like this.</p>
<p>A second use of psychedelics, overlapping but different from therapeutic healing,</p>
<p>is using psychedelics to promote spiritual awakening, an awakening to the true nature,</p>
<p>our deeper nature underneath our personality nature, to deepen our</p>
<p>understanding, our experience of the wisdom of the universe, the intelligence of</p>
<p>the universe, the consciousness of the universe, classic kind of spiritual awakening</p>
<p>to the nature of spiritual reality. And that's why I got started in this work,</p>
<p>really, was to deepen my spiritual awakening. But the protocol that I ended up using was so</p>
<p>strong and so evocative. Within a few years, I was having experiences that went far beyond</p>
<p>anything that could be understood in terms of either therapeutic healing or spiritual</p>
<p>awakening. And I came to understand over time that the project</p>
<p>that I was involved in was cosmological exploration. That</p>
<p>is, a systematic attempt to explore the deep structure of spiritual</p>
<p>reality or the deep structure of the consciousness of the universe</p>
<p>itself. So that's really what my work is about. I'm not a clinician. I am trained as a philosopher</p>
<p>of religion. What interested me from Stan Grof's early work was the capacity of these substances</p>
<p>to lay bare not only the personal issues, but to enter into deep communion with the consciousness</p>
<p>that lies behind existence. Can you share, give us an overview of the</p>
<p>different types of psychedelics? Just to kind of list them off, of course, because</p>
<p>there are many, but we're going to primarily talk about your experience with LSD today. Many</p>
<p>psychedelics. I mean, I guess the primary ones that come to mind are LSD, psilocybin, MDMA,</p>
<p>though that's probably an empathogen more than psychedelic, 5-MeO-DMT, salvia divinorum, San</p>
<p>Pedro. I mean, I think these are the types of psychedelics that most people are familiar</p>
<p>with. There are all sorts of derivatives. MDMA, they're derivatives off of each of</p>
<p>these little tweaks along the way. And we also want to say upfront that you're</p>
<p>not recommending necessarily that people engage in the same process you engaged in</p>
<p>or advocating necessarily for the use of these per se. Is that right? Absolutely.</p>
<p>There are a large percentage of the population who shouldn't be doing psychedelics at all. These</p>
<p>are very powerful amplifiers of consciousness. They have tremendous evocative potential. And</p>
<p>there are persons who should not be venturing into these waters. And no one should be</p>
<p>venturing into these waters without really good, high quality, professional guides accompanying</p>
<p>you to keep you safe as you enter into this territory. Now, the protocol that I chose to work</p>
<p>with was high doses of LSD. I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms. And looking back at it, at</p>
<p>the end of it, I think, what was I thinking? That was ridiculous. But I had a deep hunger to</p>
<p>explore the nature of existence. And working at these high doses took me on an adventure of</p>
<p>a lifetime. But this is very demanding work, which requires a lot of</p>
<p>concentration, a lot of safeguards, and a lot of time to assimilate the experiences</p>
<p>And I really, knowing what I know now, at the end of this journey, I strongly recommend against</p>
<p>using the protocol that I used. If I were doing it over again, I would work with lower doses of</p>
<p>psychedelics. I'd be much gentler on myself. I'd be willing to sort of peel</p>
<p>back the layers of the psyche much more gradually than I did in this work. So</p>
<p>to begin into your journey, what was the impetus for you to embark on this deep exploration with</p>
<p>high doses of LSD? Well, I had just finished my graduate work. I had just started my academic</p>
<p>career. At the time, I was a pretty convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. And then I</p>
<p>met the work of two people. Ian Stevenson, whose work on reincarnation convinced me</p>
<p>that reincarnation was a simple fact of life. And the other one was Stanislav Grof. And I read</p>
<p>his book Realms of the Human Unconscious. I read it in 1978, two years after it had just come out.</p>
<p>And as soon as I read that book, I recognized that Stan's work had tremendous significance, not</p>
<p>only for psychotherapy, but it had tremendous significance for philosophy</p>
<p>of religion, philosophy of consciousness. And I knew that if I was ever</p>
<p>going to make a contribution in this field, I had to undergo my own therapeutic exploration,</p>
<p>my own regimen. So very uncomfortably, I made a decision to break the law in a very, I hope,</p>
<p>disciplined and restrained way. And I began a series of psychedelic sessions, which ended up,</p>
<p>much to my surprise, ended up lasting 20 years. I worked for four years, I stopped for six years,</p>
<p>and then I worked for another 10 years, finishing in 1999. And then I spent 20 years after that,</p>
<p>digesting these experiences, analyzing them, sifting them, sorting them, and then wrote</p>
<p>LSD in the Mind of the Universe in 2019, 20 years after I had stopped my sessions.</p>
<p>Can you give us a sense of what your sessions were like? How you began?</p>
<p>You mentioned that you had a sitter, somebody with you in that process. How did</p>
<p>you choose to set up your set and setting? Well, basically, I followed the protocol</p>
<p>established by Stan, reflected in his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and then</p>
<p>clarified further in his book LSD Psychotherapy, where he lays out all the nuts and bolts of</p>
<p>working in this modality. I was always in a room separated from the world, protected from the</p>
<p>world, no interruptions, by myself with my sitter, who was my wife at the time, who's a clinical</p>
<p>psychologist who studied the psychedelic literature with me. I'm lying down, I'm using</p>
<p>eye shades and headphones, conventional kind of classic psychedelic deep introspection, deep</p>
<p>meditative orientation, very carefully curated music to support the opening and the peaking and</p>
<p>the closing of a session. So the basic idea is to profoundly energize the unconscious and then</p>
<p>to create an environment where the energies rising through your unconscious can be engaged cleanly</p>
<p>and clearly. If you stay in contact with the physical world, if you're in dialogue with friends</p>
<p>or if you're going to a concert, that's all fine and good, but that's just not what this work</p>
<p>is about. It requires a powerful amplification of the unconscious, but then creating a very</p>
<p>carefully controlled environment that allows you to engage what rises conscientiously and most</p>
<p>importantly to follow whatever arises to its very bottom level, to the bottom line, to let it take</p>
<p>you wherever it wants to take you. If I recall correctly, it was typically on Saturdays because</p>
<p>you had a very important day job teaching at a university and I think your sessions lasted about, was it eight hours each</p>
<p>roughly? Yeah, pretty much. I would start in the early morning and I would</p>
<p>finish by nighttime that night, a late afternoon nighttime, so a session would last eight, ten</p>
<p>hours or so of the carryover tail, but basically a good hard eight hours each session. So it's a</p>
<p>major commitment. Eventually I developed spiritual protocols that I would adopt in the weeks leading</p>
<p>up to a session and in the weeks after a session and particularly the day or two before a</p>
<p>session and the day or two after the session. You really have to work with that time and</p>
<p>with the energy that is stirred in you because if you're working with very high doses of a</p>
<p>powerful psychedelic like LSD, it taps into very deep levels of the universe and it takes</p>
<p>your body and mind and subtle energy system a time to process that material and so it's a</p>
<p>major time commitment. It's just not the day of. It's several days before and several days after.</p>
<p>You also took meticulous notes from your sessions as well, which is a lot of what's in your book.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the first step of integration is to create an accurate phenomenological description</p>
<p>of exactly what happens in your sessions because integration is the foundation of your future</p>
<p>sessions. If you don't integrate your sessions thoroughly and conscientiously, then you're</p>
<p>not going to have as likely to have as deep an experience the next session out. So there's a</p>
<p>circle where you open, but then you integrate what you experience, which lays the foundation</p>
<p>for the deeper opening in your next session. Yeah, it seems like they built upon each other. In my experience, they did. Again, I kind of</p>
<p>standardized my sessions as much as possible, eliminating as many variables. I always was</p>
<p>using the same substance, the same dose, the same set and setting, the same sitter,</p>
<p>even in the same part of the country. If you change those variables, it changes the</p>
<p>subtlety of the interface between your mind and the universe's mind that you're engaging.</p>
<p>So by trying to standardize those variables, you create an environment of sustained</p>
<p>communion or dialogue with this deeper consciousness. And by creating that sustained</p>
<p>clear contact point, my experience was that the universe or the consciousness, whatever</p>
<p>it was that I was engaging, that consciousness took me deeper and deeper in a systematic fashion.</p>
<p>It was like taking a series of graduate courses in consciousness. It was a tremendous, rigorous,</p>
<p>systematic expansion of my frame of reality. Why did you choose this path versus, for example,</p>
<p>sitting in meditation or some other spiritual path that can lead you deeper into these realms?</p>
<p>Well, I had been meditating since college. I was familiar with meditation. I'd meditated in a</p>
<p>couple of different traditions by that time. And I'm a professor of religious studies, so</p>
<p>I had a good solid grounding in the world's spiritual traditions. I taught courses in</p>
<p>psychology of religion and transpersonal studies and comparative mysticism. So I understood the</p>
<p>world of meditation and contemplative practice. I started by thinking that these sessions would</p>
<p>basically help me break through some of the obstacles that had risen in my contemplative</p>
<p>practice. What I found, however, was that this was a protocol of</p>
<p>spiritual exploration took me deeper than I had ever imagined</p>
<p>being possible when I began this work. And once I was into it a couple of years,</p>
<p>I had developed an aptitude for working in these states. And I never stopped meditating. I was</p>
<p>always meditating through this time. I was always doing yoga and various spiritual practices. In</p>
<p>fact, I think that the deeper you want to go in working with psychedelics, the more important</p>
<p>it is to have a daily spiritual practice that helps anchor you and helps you absorb the</p>
<p>experiences that you unleash with psychedelics. It was a different protocol. It gave me access</p>
<p>to states of consciousness that you can reach with meditation, but only with lifetimes,</p>
<p>not just one lifetime, but many lifetimes of meditation. So I differentiate between</p>
<p>what I call the path of temporary immersion, which is working with psychedelics, as you're</p>
<p>only immersed in these states for hours at a time, versus the path of presence, of contemplative</p>
<p>presence, where it's a slower path, but it tends to produce states of abiding</p>
<p>transparency, whereas the temporary path pushes you deep into these conscious domains,</p>
<p>and then it wears off and you come back. They're complementing approaches,</p>
<p>but they are different. Let's begin with your very first session. Just</p>
<p>to get us started, because I know you've done many of them, to give the listeners, the audience,</p>
<p>the viewers a taste of what your experience was like that led you to keep</p>
<p>wanting to come back for more. Probably the most significant thing</p>
<p>that happened in my first session was that I entered a phase of the work where I</p>
<p>could not remember who I was. I could not remember what I was, what I did for a living. I could</p>
<p>not remember whether I was a man or a woman, even. It was a complete interruption of my stream</p>
<p>of consciousness that was telling me who and what I was. This was a frightening experience, a</p>
<p>jarring experience, but in the end, I learned that it was a very helpful experience because it</p>
<p>showed me that it would be pointless for me to try to stay in control, because if you can't control</p>
<p>your self-knowledge, then that's about as basic as you can get. This session taught me that</p>
<p>in this work, you have to surrender radically to whatever arises. It saved me a lot of time</p>
<p>and energy later when more demanding experiences opened. There's a tendency to sort of want to</p>
<p>maintain control, to hold on to reality as you know it. In this type of work, you have to let go</p>
<p>of reality as you know it. You have to completely surrender and go where it wants to take you. That</p>
<p>was just the first lesson that basically said, don't waste time trying to maintain control.</p>
<p>Before we go further into some of your sessions and giving us a taste of your experiences and</p>
<p>what you learned, have you come to understand the physiology of what LSD is doing on the</p>
<p>human physiology, the nervous system? Of course, a lot of people think about connect consciousness</p>
<p>with the brain, which of course, it's more than that. However, I recently spoke with Jill Bolte</p>
<p>Taylor, who is a neuroanatomist from Harvard. She wrote a well-known book, Her Stroke of</p>
<p>Insight, where she had a stroke. She had an eight-year journey of recovery back, but she</p>
<p>described that our personal sense of identity is just the size of a peanut in our brains. I</p>
<p>follow the discussion of the scientists about what is biochemistry of LSD and how it affects</p>
<p>brain structure and default mode network interruption and those type of discussions,</p>
<p>but I'm not really drawn to that conversation. I'm not primarily a scientist in training. I</p>
<p>basically have taken more of a psychological approach to understanding that</p>
<p>these substances, whatever their mechanism, they amplify consciousness.</p>
<p>They hypersensitize consciousness and they allow you to experience dimensions of your mind and</p>
<p>of reality beyond your mind, which usually were kept in a space-time kind of focus</p>
<p>where we don't experience these subtler textures. Right. Where we can feel trapped inside our bodies</p>
<p>or in what most people consider is primarily the materialistic world, which we know is</p>
<p>there's much more than that, which is what we're talking about today.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah. That's the real draw to me. I basically work within the frame of reference</p>
<p>that I had acquired from Stan Grof and some of the other earlier researchers using a description</p>
<p>of the dynamic qualities of psychedelic consciousness or the consciousness that arises</p>
<p>with psychedelics. I'll let the science guys sort out the physiology of it.</p>
<p>I know that that's interesting and I find that often the physiological</p>
<p>discussion is carried out within reductive metaphysical assumptions, which really is</p>
<p>not helping our conversation right now. You mean the conversation in general.</p>
<p>We're having a good conversation, right? I mean, particularly the attempts to sort of</p>
<p>understand, to correlate what's happening in the brain physiologically with the states</p>
<p>of consciousness that one is experiencing, but often these discussions take place within</p>
<p>a certain set of metaphysical assumptions, and too often those metaphysical assumptions</p>
<p>tend to be reductive. They tend to sort of lean in the direction of thinking that physical</p>
<p>reality is the dominant and determining reality of one's experience. But when you actually look</p>
<p>at the experiences that emerge in psychedelics, that restrictive metaphysical</p>
<p>framework is shattered. Yeah. Well, I just want to touch</p>
<p>on it for now and primarily because there may be those listening thinking, well,</p>
<p>this is just your brain on drugs and it's causing the whole chemical reaction. That's been discussed</p>
<p>with near-death experiencers and so forth, but research has shown that there's more going</p>
<p>on with that. So I definitely understand what you're saying and we can get into the</p>
<p>veracity or the trusting of these experiences a little later in our conversation. Can you</p>
<p>take us more into some of your experiences with your sessions with LSD to give us</p>
<p>a taste of what that was like for you? That's a hard question. I mean, let's give a</p>
<p>context. Some very influential books were written based on a very limited number of psychedelic</p>
<p>experiences. So Aldous Huxley wrote his very important, beautiful book, The Doors of</p>
<p>Perception, after only one mescaline experience. Houston Smith wrote his book, his</p>
<p>Collected Reflections on Psychedelics, Cleansing the Doors of Perception, after only</p>
<p>taking LSD six times over the course of his lifetime. Michael Pollan wrote his book, which</p>
<p>is a very important, very helpful book, but after only a handful of psychedelic experiences. So the</p>
<p>challenge that anyone faces coming into my work are the challenges that I have conveying my</p>
<p>experiences is just how long the journey was, how many layers of consciousness opened in that</p>
<p>journey. It's not simply a matter of opening 73 times to the same interface, is that there is a</p>
<p>cycle of death and rebirth that reproduces itself so that death breaks you free of one level of</p>
<p>reality, physical reality, in the beginning. It enters, takes you into a non-physical,</p>
<p>spiritual reality, and you work there for a while, but if you work consistently, eventually</p>
<p>you'll go through another death and rebirth that will take you into another level of</p>
<p>reality where you have to learn the whole rules of that level of reality, which then</p>
<p>will be followed taking you into another level. So the problem I have with answering your</p>
<p>question is so many levels of reality. If I focused on any one, I'd be leaving out so many others. So</p>
<p>let me just say this in the beginning. When I was looking over the whole of my sessions</p>
<p>and putting them together in order to write this storyline of what happened on those sessions,</p>
<p>I eventually differentiated or distinguished five different broad categories that my sessions</p>
<p>fell into. First, having to do with personal mind, your personal unconscious, your personal story.</p>
<p>Second, collective mind, which has to do with the collective psyche, the psyche of humanity,</p>
<p>the species mind. The third, archetypal mind, which in my case, I'm primarily addressing</p>
<p>not archetypes in the Jungian sense, but archetypes more in the Platonic sense of the</p>
<p>levels, dimensions of reality, which lie outside time and space and outside the collective</p>
<p>psyche. Causal levels of reality are the level of oneness, the level where</p>
<p>oneness becomes the dominant reality. And then beyond that, diamond luminosity, a</p>
<p>particularly clear dimension of light that I encountered and worked with in the last five</p>
<p>years of my work. So all of my experiences, I can kind of lay them out as a sequential</p>
<p>journey, starting at the level of personal mind, moving into the level of collective mind,</p>
<p>archetypal mind, so on and so forth. Well, I would love to discuss each of those</p>
<p>levels you went into. What I recall reading in your book that seemed to be common themes of</p>
<p>your sessions were that it was, like you said earlier, a letting go and that there was, it</p>
<p>seemed a lot of pain and suffering to actually reach to these deeper levels of consciousness.</p>
<p>Can you share what that was like for you? In the early stage, and when I was working at</p>
<p>the level of personal mind, that the pain and suffering came in the form of what Stan Grof</p>
<p>has very well discussed and presented in his discussion of the perinatal level</p>
<p>of consciousness. Basically, sometimes reliving your birth,</p>
<p>but confronting the fundamental existential questions that dominate life and physical reality.</p>
<p>Is there any meaning in the universe? Is there any order, any design to it, any intelligence of it?</p>
<p>Because at just the physical level, everything we love, everything we know will be destroyed at</p>
<p>death. Is there any reality beyond death? I mean, that's, and therefore you, you have to face the</p>
<p>deepest levels of metaphysical angst in order to move through this until eventually your identity</p>
<p>is just crushed and shattered. That's easier for some people to undergo</p>
<p>than it is for other people, but you have to surrender your time-space identity</p>
<p>in order to gain access to the next level of reality. At that next level of reality, I</p>
<p>continue to have a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence. It</p>
<p>was so deep and it lasted so long and it seemed to encompass so many hundreds of thousands</p>
<p>of persons in so many thousands of years that I eventually came to the</p>
<p>decision that this was not some, didn't represent a deepening or</p>
<p>cleansing or healing of my personal psyche. That what was being healed</p>
<p>here was some aspect of the collective psyche of humanity itself, that something was</p>
<p>using my sessions in order to set in motion a reconciliation and a healing of levels of pain</p>
<p>that were fundamentally collective, not personal. And then more levels of death and rebirth</p>
<p>where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. But the</p>
<p>basic principle is pretty simple. If you want to experience oneness with God or if</p>
<p>you want to experience a deep experience of the nature of the mind of the universe, the problem</p>
<p>is our historical consciousness is just too small. If you want to literally experience it, I mean</p>
<p>it's one thing to think about it, but to actually immerse yourself in the communion with these</p>
<p>levels of reality, your small identity has to be surrendered and you have to flow, be willing</p>
<p>to flow into a larger level of identity. So eventually you're going into levels of reality</p>
<p>where it would be a misrepresentation to think that Chris Bache went and had those experiences.</p>
<p>Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved in order for these levels of</p>
<p>consciousness to manifest inside Chris Bache's awareness. But the fact that I remember those</p>
<p>experiences doesn't mean that my personality identity was present when those experiences were</p>
<p>being had. It's kind of like you have to lose yourself, enter into communion with the universe,</p>
<p>and then when you come back you gather your and then my personality synthesizes them,</p>
<p>digests them, trying to integrate them. But it's a pulsing. You learn to sort of</p>
<p>surrender completely, open, breathe deeply, you receive teachings, then</p>
<p>you bring it all back in, and then you try to integrate it and consolidate</p>
<p>it. What are some of the teachings you received? That the universe is a manifestation of a single</p>
<p>consciousness, a massive consciousness, beyond anything that we've ever begun to grasp</p>
<p>in our Western religious and philosophical traditions, that creation is an</p>
<p>intentional act. It is an act … I hate to use the word design because those</p>
<p>theories are problematic, but there is an intelligence manifesting itself in time and</p>
<p>space that we are part of this intelligence, that our nature is of the same nature as its</p>
<p>nature. So this is an ancient idea. Atman is Brahman. The essence of the individual is the</p>
<p>essence of the totality. That reincarnation is simply a fact of life. I don't think we get</p>
<p>anywhere in trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life, unless we</p>
<p>understand that our current life is just the most recent in many, many repeating cycles of</p>
<p>life and death. That there is an underlying logic to the circumstances within which we find</p>
<p>ourselves. The Buddhists and the Hindus talk about karma, that there is a deeper</p>
<p>intentionality working itself out in the circumstances of</p>
<p>our existence, and that… our evolutionary existence, is not simply driven</p>
<p>by blind chance and mechanical processes, which are purely mechanical, but that there</p>
<p>is a deeper intelligence manifesting itself in the circumstances of our life, in</p>
<p>the challenges that we are facing, and inviting us to become more by the end</p>
<p>of our life than we were in the beginning. So just a few touch points. Yeah, yeah. Going</p>
<p>back to your experiences in these sessions, it seems that death and rebirth and a</p>
<p>purification process happened in many, if not all, of your sessions. Yeah. What did</p>
<p>you come to understand was the reason for that? First, the general structure of the</p>
<p>sessions as I experienced them is that every session, there's a sort of a rhythm</p>
<p>of a cycle with variations, but basically, the first early hours of a session are spent</p>
<p>in some type of deep purification process, deep confrontation. And then if you surrender to</p>
<p>that process and let it take you, it reaches a culmination point. There is a surrender, a death</p>
<p>rebirth process in which you are then spun into transpersonal ecstatic places for the remainder</p>
<p>of the session. And then that runs its course. And then the next session, however many months</p>
<p>between, and I was doing about five sessions a year on average, starts you right back into</p>
<p>the purification part and carrying you then forward into the ecstatic portion. So the purpose</p>
<p>of the purification and the purpose of the death is simply cleaning, just cleaning,</p>
<p>cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. When you eventually come to have deep experience</p>
<p>of the fundamental identity of your nature and the divine nature, or the infinite nature,</p>
<p>that you are the infinite, then it gives you a different perspective on what it is that was</p>
<p>present preventing you all those years from realizing that. what was keeping you from it. And</p>
<p>it's this tight conditioning of the psyche. It's the type conditioning which is associated with</p>
<p>your time-space consciousness. And that has to be softened, it has to be released, it has to be let go in order to</p>
<p>move into these expansive places. So the death rebirth cycle is actually a</p>
<p>purification cycle. In fact, I learned that death is actually an intense stage of</p>
<p>purification. Once you've died many times, you learn that truly it's impossible to die. What</p>
<p>you are can die. The structure of your life can die. Reality as you have known it can die. But the</p>
<p>phoenix always rises. The essence of the person always emerges in a different reality</p>
<p>with new potentials, with new capacities, but it's impossible to die. And the reason</p>
<p>we can't die is, I think, because our nature is the nature of the divine. So the form can die,</p>
<p>but the essence cannot die. Once you know that, then I began to understand that the experience</p>
<p>of death, which kept coming up in my sessions, was actually an experience, an</p>
<p>advanced experience of purification. When purification reaches a critical portion,</p>
<p>position, so that it begins to dissolve the fundamental structures of what you had known</p>
<p>as real, then you have reached the death point, the death and rebirth point. And death has come</p>
<p>back to grace you again. So from my perspective, experiencing death in a psychedelic session</p>
<p>or to experience horrendous suffering or pain is actually an exciting stage in the work. It's</p>
<p>not something to be avoided. A lot of people worry about, oh, I don't want to have a bad session. We</p>
<p>got to do everything we can to avoid having a bad session. But I think that's a</p>
<p>radical misunderstanding of the depth of consciousness and the power that</p>
<p>technique gives you. In my experience, you begin to understand that</p>
<p>the deeper the purification, the deeper the ecstatic immersion, so that you</p>
<p>begin to welcome the purification. You begin to welcome the challenges that you face. You begin</p>
<p>to welcome the bad sessions in order to actualize a higher, more intimate experience with the</p>
<p>divine consciousness. Now, that's assuming that you're working in a completely controlled</p>
<p>environment. You have done all the homework. You've done your preparation. You can have a bad</p>
<p>session for a lot of bad reasons. You can be in the wrong place, the wrong time, not preparing</p>
<p>yourself, wrong set and setting. Those can give you bad sessions, which are not of the quality</p>
<p>that I'm talking about. Yeah, I will share that when I was in high school, a group of friends</p>
<p>wanted to do LSD or acid as it was called as well. And I did not partake. However, I was the sitter</p>
<p>and my role was to make sure that everybody did have a good experience, which actually</p>
<p>the few times that that happened was always the case. But, I know you mentioned that a bad trip is not necessarily a bad trip. Yeah.</p>
<p>So you suggest that that's part of the process, but one needs to be… have done the preparation</p>
<p>ahead of time to know what they're getting into. Yeah, I mean, psychedelics amplify consciousness</p>
<p>and most people will take us like… I don't want to overgeneralize… Some people take a psychedelic</p>
<p>and what they're looking for is a good afternoon, a little more openness to the life of the</p>
<p>universe, a little more openness to the love that's in the universe. And they maintain the</p>
<p>fundamental parameters of their personality, get softer and expansive and let some of</p>
<p>these experiences in, which is perfectly fine. But if you want to go into a deep dive, if you</p>
<p>want to explore the deep structure of existence, if you want to transcend space, transcend</p>
<p>time, move into the deep future, that requires a more carefully</p>
<p>laid out strategy in working with these states. So I'm not suggesting</p>
<p>that the way I work with these states is the only way, beneficial way to work with these states is</p>
<p>simply for me as a philosopher, I was looking for depth of immersion, depth of understanding</p>
<p>that takes some serious work. So while we're on the topic of this death and rebirth,</p>
<p>surrendering, purification, can you share with us what is it that dies and reborn? I know you</p>
<p>outline in your book a few different areas that you've come to understand. Yeah, well basically</p>
<p>this became a real intellectual issue for me. I mean, when you experience dying and being reborn</p>
<p>through multiple levels of reality, it then becomes a question, what</p>
<p>is it that's actually dying? You may have deep and profound experiences of</p>
<p>dying years after you've gone through ego death, and it's not simply the ego dying over and over</p>
<p>and over again. It's a different kind of death. So at the appendix in LSD and the Mind of the</p>
<p>Universe, I have an appendix on what dies and is reborn, and I suggest four levels of maybe</p>
<p>beginning to address that question. One of them is what dies is our personal ego. Second is</p>
<p>what dies is some aspect of the collective ego, of the collective psyche. Third, what dies is what</p>
<p>I call the shamanic persona, complicated concept, but when you've been on the journey for a long</p>
<p>time, when you move into psychedelic space, you resume your psychedelic persona, you</p>
<p>resume your shamanic persona. It's like, as a friend of mine said, you</p>
<p>walk with the old ones once again. You've made the transition often enough that</p>
<p>your shamanic persona is the living integration of all of your psychedelic experiences up to</p>
<p>that point in time. So let's say, in this case, 20 sessions in, working at the level of the</p>
<p>collective psyche into what I call the ocean of suffering, you stabilize a psychedelic</p>
<p>identity, a shamanic persona that integrates all the experiences that you have had of</p>
<p>transpersonal states of consciousness beyond your physical consciousness. If you are going to</p>
<p>go into yet a still deeper level of consciousness beyond where you had lived before, then that</p>
<p>shamanic persona has to die. It has to surrender in order for a new category instead</p>
<p>of a category of experiences to emerge and for a still deeper shamanic persona to</p>
<p>emerge. And so I think in some advanced sessions, what is dying is the previous identity</p>
<p>or the identity which we had developed from sustained psychedelic experiences over</p>
<p>many years. So that's I think the third thing is I would suggest it's what I call the shamanic</p>
<p>persona or the shamanic self is dying. It's not the egoic self. It's your psychedelic self,</p>
<p>which is dying. And then at a more subtle level, I think what is dying is actually some</p>
<p>dimension of consciousness itself. And this gets harder to discuss because it requires a more</p>
<p>subtle level of understanding. But basically, sometimes in my late work, when I was working</p>
<p>at very deep levels of consciousness, when I was working in deep levels of divine communion, I had</p>
<p>the experience that the divine level that I was experiencing came itself into a crescendo which</p>
<p>opened up a higher level of divine communion than had been actualized up to this point in</p>
<p>time. Sri Aurobindo says when he's talking in his metaphysical system, he says, looking down,</p>
<p>the divine sees all the levels of reality that it's manifested, but it's a one-way mirror.</p>
<p>So the divine looking down sees everything. But we, who are the divine looking up, tend to</p>
<p>see only the level that we are at. So it's a one-way mirror. And that means even at deep, deep</p>
<p>levels, so we'd say there are aspects of divine consciousness which cannot see or experience</p>
<p>into still deeper levels of divine consciousness. And somehow, when we do this work, we actually can</p>
<p>facilitate a communion which takes place between two different levels of divine consciousness, far</p>
<p>beyond space-time, far beyond personal reality. And there is a celebratory joy that takes place</p>
<p>when the divine wakes up to a still deeper level of the divine. There is a communion that takes</p>
<p>place. There is a joyful celebration when the higher is able to infuse itself more deeply into</p>
<p>the lower. And so I think that one of the things, one way of thinking about what dies in very</p>
<p>advanced stages is some aspect of divine consciousness itself. And yet, according</p>
<p>to your experiences, that death then precipitates a rebirth, typically. Did you</p>
<p>discover that with consciousness itself as well? Yes. Or the divine itself? Yeah, I mean,</p>
<p>it's, again, it's complicated because we're rushing into an area where angels fear to</p>
<p>tread. Right, we're trying to put language to an experience that many, sometimes, for</p>
<p>example, with near-death experiencers, they'll say it's ineffable. So I</p>
<p>understand there's a language barrier. Well, there is a language barrier, but for me,</p>
<p>the biggest issue is not the language barrier. It is to lay the foundation, to lay the</p>
<p>prerequisites, to put things in place so that you people can understand the language that</p>
<p>you want to use to describe these phenomena. And it's not ordinary day language. It's not</p>
<p>everyday experience. It requires kind of a conceptual reframe, a conceptual understanding,</p>
<p>so that you can describe certain things that lie far beyond our ordinary, sensate experience.</p>
<p>But in some ways, it's not that different from what a near-death episode person experiences. In</p>
<p>fact, I find, I feel the greatest correspondence and collegiality with people who have had</p>
<p>deep near-death episode experiences because deep NDEs are the experiences of the closest</p>
<p>correlate to my experience with deep psychedelic work. I think if you work with psychedelics</p>
<p>in a focused way over long periods of time, you can access the same dimensions of</p>
<p>consciousness that someone accesses with an NDE, a near-death experience. The difference is that</p>
<p>where for most people, the NDE-er experiences this only once in their life. With sustained</p>
<p>psychedelics, you can go back multiple times into this territory. And because you can go back</p>
<p>multiple times, you're taught there are more nuances that are brought out in terms of how</p>
<p>this all works in the interplay of consciousness. Can you help expand the conceptual framework</p>
<p>for us a little bit about what that experience has been like for you? Let me narrow it into</p>
<p>one particular, just to take one example. When I was into the work now, I guess, four or</p>
<p>five years into the work, and I began to get systematic access to archetypal reality, and I</p>
<p>began to have experiences. Every time I went into my session, I entered a level of reality that I</p>
<p>knew was more real than space-time. It was the primary reality. Space-time was the secondary</p>
<p>reality. I had encounters with vast beings that I could not comprehend. I could not wrap my mind</p>
<p>around them. But I knew that these were the beings who were responsible for creating space-time and</p>
<p>creating fundamental conditions within space-time. But to have access to these realities,</p>
<p>everything that I had known about human history, about human thought, everything about the history</p>
<p>of humanity had to fall away because the entire collective psyche had to fall away in order</p>
<p>to enter into levels of consciousness that humanity as a whole has not had access to or</p>
<p>has not experienced. Very few number of people have access to these deep dimensions of</p>
<p>reality. But even in archetypal reality, you're dealing with very profound levels of</p>
<p>consciousness, but there is still dualism there. There is still a sense of self and other,</p>
<p>archetype and self, different archetypes. There is a dualistic quality to it. When I went</p>
<p>beyond archetypal reality into causal reality, that's the signature of causal reality that all</p>
<p>dualisms dissolve so that you begin to experience the world in whatever aspect you're experiencing</p>
<p>it. You're experiencing the world as a unified, single entity, a single consciousness.</p>
<p>I think it was Plotinus who says, the world breathes as one. And that's the</p>
<p>experience there, that there is a radical transparency that opens where you are</p>
<p>fundamentally encountering the wholeness of life that doesn't negate differentiation. In fact, it</p>
<p>affirms differentiation, but that differentiation is experienced as different manifestations</p>
<p>of this single, integrated, whole, undivided reality that we call God or we call the divine</p>
<p>or the one. That's a different category of experience altogether from archetypal reality.</p>
<p>Can you share a little bit more about why it's termed archetypal reality or that layer for</p>
<p>those who maybe aren't familiar with archetypes? I use the term archetype in two senses here.</p>
<p>One is Jung talked about archetypes as the primary themes, the repetitive themes of human</p>
<p>experience that become concretized in forms, old man, old woman, trickster,</p>
<p>jokester, those clacks of shadow. And then, so I think of them as kind of</p>
<p>archetypal in the sense of the primary, the dominant themes of the</p>
<p>collective psyche. I see. The second way in which archetypes</p>
<p>is used is in the Platonic tradition, where Plato talks about the discovery of a level</p>
<p>of reality that lies beyond time-space altogether. And I experience both. I experience Plato's</p>
<p>sense of archetypes. I experience that reality, but not in the way that Plato describes it. Plato</p>
<p>thinks of archetypes as eternal principles within an eternal being. So they are the unchanging</p>
<p>prototypes that are used in creation, and they exist within the mind of an unchanging divine,</p>
<p>unchanging infinite being. That's not how I experience those archetypes. I experience them</p>
<p>as living entities, but living on a vast scale of time and space, far beyond anything that we</p>
<p>know inside time and space. But what is shared is that for something to manifest inside time</p>
<p>and space, it comes out of the oneness through these fundamental intermediate structures,</p>
<p>which are very profound, super-intelligent, super-powerful structures, and then focusing</p>
<p>this energy down into concretizing it, concretizing it, into eventually manifesting</p>
<p>in space-time reality as we know it. When I experience the collective psyche, and</p>
<p>I experience a lower level of archetypes, in Jung's sense of archetypes, it was similar to</p>
<p>Jung's sense in that there were these archetypal themes within humanity, but I did not experience</p>
<p>what Jung experienced as archetypes. I didn't have the experience of wise old man, wise old woman,</p>
<p>things like this. It's not that I don't think those exist. What I experienced was humanity as</p>
<p>a single organism, over and over and over again, as a single organism, and that there</p>
<p>were metameridians within humanity that wove all of our individual lives into</p>
<p>the life of the human species as a whole. So I learned that our minds are woven into the</p>
<p>collective mind. They are aspects. They are seed crystals within the collective mind. Even our</p>
<p>bodies and the diseases that we have to manage are all part of the body of humanity</p>
<p>evolving itself over long periods of time. So it was archetypal in the sense of</p>
<p>trans-individual motifs within the human psyche, but it wasn't quite the way Jung</p>
<p>conceptualized it. So basically, archetypes in this way reflect the insight</p>
<p>that there are dominant structures that are supra-personal. They go beyond the</p>
<p>functioning of individual beings, and then in platonic sense, there are</p>
<p>metaphysical archetypes that basically inform manifestation of time and space itself.</p>
<p>So at the causal level, you mentioned this is where you connect with the divine intelligence,</p>
<p>what we perceive as God. I imagine there may be people listening wondering,</p>
<p>did you discover that there is a God? I generally tend not to like to use God language,</p>
<p>though I do. The reason I don't like to use God language is because as someone who knows the</p>
<p>history of world religions pretty well, I also know all the theologies that have gone into</p>
<p>God language, and all the cultural limitations that go into it, and all the abuse that went into</p>
<p>it, and all the crimes and the horrible things that have been done in the name of God. And</p>
<p>certainly, I'm not talking about God in anything like that. And so I would use the word the divine</p>
<p>instead of God, but that's really that's just an end run, because even the concept of the divine</p>
<p>carries into it certain carryovers from our time-space experience. And so on the one hand,</p>
<p>I want to affirm the idea that there is this profound generative intelligence</p>
<p>manifesting as time and space, that time and space is not something</p>
<p>which is independent of the divine, but it is a classic Hindu thinking, it is</p>
<p>the manifestation of the body of the divine. So in that way, I want to affirm a</p>
<p>very wide vision of the divine, of God. But because I've gone so deeply into the future,</p>
<p>and so deeply beyond space and time so many times, my understanding or my feeling</p>
<p>for this cosmic principle, I can't fit it inside the theologies of the</p>
<p>religions of the world. It's just it's much larger than that. And so on the one hand, okay,</p>
<p>I can call it God, but then I have to qualify that it's not this, it's not that, it's not what</p>
<p>you mean by God here, it's not what you mean by God there. Right, like a lot of people think of,</p>
<p>at least in the monotheistic traditions, think of individual or a being that were made in the form</p>
<p>of, right? And that's what I think people are maybe curious about is what you discovered as</p>
<p>far as, you know, did you connect with a being or beings or angels or other divine entities? And if</p>
<p>you could share a little bit about what that realm was like. In all the years when I was doing this</p>
<p>work and all the work I did, I never encountered a being, a divine beings that I'm God, you know,</p>
<p>this is what I am. It wasn't like that. It was like, I would go deeper into a level of</p>
<p>consciousness and I would experience a communion with this consciousness. And this consciousness</p>
<p>would teach me, it knew me, it would teach me and show me things and it would crush me and</p>
<p>then bring me forward into still deeper levels. And I would go into those deeper levels and I</p>
<p>would enter into communion with those levels and I internalized the energy of those</p>
<p>levels and I was with this consciousness. But it never crystallized into a specific form. I</p>
<p>always felt its presence. It guided my sessions. I could enter into dialogue with it. I</p>
<p>could enter into communion with it. It would dissolve me into</p>
<p>itself. But it never crystallized into what you might call a</p>
<p>personality of God or a person of God. And it just kept getting larger and larger,</p>
<p>deeper and deeper, more and more vast. And I think that many of our theologies of God</p>
<p>or our thinking about God is really based upon what I would call the early</p>
<p>encounters with an infinite intelligence. That this infinite intelligence</p>
<p>is far larger, far too large to ever be concretized in the historical</p>
<p>lineages that we recognize in the world traditions. It's infinite in itself.</p>
<p>In fact, when I was in the deepest level of consciousness that I ever went into when I was in</p>
<p>the diamond luminosity work, and that's the work that occupied me for the last five years, when I</p>
<p>was as deep into the diamond luminosity as I had ever entered and I was far beyond time-space</p>
<p>reality, I was dissolved into the luminous, you might say the body of the divine, all of</p>
<p>a sudden my visual field turned 90 degrees, a window opened up, and I saw reality far, far in</p>
<p>the distance. And I saw a light in that reality, and a beam of light came out of that reality</p>
<p>and hit me. And I was in the diamond luminosity condition. But this light was so powerful,</p>
<p>it shattered my mind. And it took me minutes to recover from this. And that's when I began to</p>
<p>realize it's an infinite progression. The divine is truly an infinite reality. Even using this</p>
<p>powerful method, I would never get to the end of this reality. And that's one of the reasons</p>
<p>why I would be much gentler with myself if I were doing this again today. Because I discovered,</p>
<p>see, when I began this work, I thought that the purpose was to reach a state of consciousness, to</p>
<p>reach enlightenment, or to reach oneness with God, or to dissolve into the primal void. And I had</p>
<p>known oneness with God at many different levels, and I had entered into the primal void several</p>
<p>times, and I'd learned that there were different depths of the primal void. And so now I began to</p>
<p>understand that it's not about getting to some end state, which is going to magically transform</p>
<p>your life. It's a matter of opening up and letting the love and intelligence of the universe or the</p>
<p>divine into you as much as you can bring it in, as much as you can hold on to it, as much as</p>
<p>you can distill into the fabric of your living existence, your earthly existence. It's not about</p>
<p>getting to some end point. It's about deepening the ongoing communion that exists between</p>
<p>ourselves inside time and space and this larger spiritual reality. Very beautiful. Can you</p>
<p>share more with us about the diamond luminosity? Light surfaces many times in our psychedelic</p>
<p>work. I mean, every time you go through a death rebirth experience, very</p>
<p>typically people encounter the light, many forms of light. And I had</p>
<p>encountered this light at many different levels along the journey. After I'd gone through ego</p>
<p>death, after I'd gone through the ocean of suffering work, after I'd gone through archetypal</p>
<p>reality, after I'd gone into the causal level reality, about 15 years into my work, when I had</p>
<p>been given so many spiritual treasures, I felt completely existentially satisfied. I mean, I just</p>
<p>I had been to experience radical Śūnyatā, emptiness of self, oneness of all existence</p>
<p>had been offered so many treasures. And then I went through yet another</p>
<p>cycle of death and rebirth. And I accessed a level of light, a dimension</p>
<p>of light, that was so pure and so clear, it absolutely stunned me. And it became my sole</p>
<p>objective in the rest of my psychedelic work to return to this reality. Because once you</p>
<p>touch what I'm calling the diamond luminosity, once you touch it, it's a reality which is so</p>
<p>far beyond anything that I had ever touched in any of my earlier work, that I just lost interest</p>
<p>in archetypal reality, I lost interest in causal reality, I wanted to get back into this level of</p>
<p>reality. It's so pure, it's just breathtakingly magnificently pure, and the levels of ecstasy</p>
<p>associated with it are just staggering. And in the next five years of work, in 26 sessions,</p>
<p>which is one third of my entire journey, I only got access to this level of reality four times.</p>
<p>So in between those four sessions were lots of purification, more purification at a very</p>
<p>deep level, more learning, more teaching, but accessing this reality four times. And</p>
<p>I think as I look at the world's literature, the spiritual literature, and Buddhist literature</p>
<p>is probably the tradition that I know the best, they call this level of reality Dharmakāya, the clear light of absolute</p>
<p>reality. So it is considered in their tradition, the absolute foundational</p>
<p>reality of time and space, all time and space reality, all the galaxies, all the big bang emerge</p>
<p>out of this crystalline light, which is a pre samsaric, it's what we would</p>
<p>call an extra samsaric reality. It's outside of the cycle of space and</p>
<p>time. So it's outside of physical reality, and it's also outside of the bardos of postmortem</p>
<p>existence. It's outside of the entire system. Once you touch it, you're hopelessly in love with it</p>
<p>for the rest of your life. It just is something that illumines everything. I understood what</p>
<p>Buddhist meant when they said, touch it once, it can undo hundreds of years of living in the</p>
<p>shadows of karma. Because it has such a penetrating transformative</p>
<p>effect, impact, that just to touch it, it changes your whole understanding of</p>
<p>existence, and your whole experience of what it means to be alive. Is this also what</p>
<p>you refer to in your book as the beloved? Well, you know, everybody has to find a word to</p>
<p>describe this transcendent reality. We can talk about God, or we can talk about the divine. Some</p>
<p>people call it the absolute. Daoism calls it the eternal Dao. Jewish mysticism calls it the Ein</p>
<p>Sof, the great nothingness, the great emptiness. I call it my beloved, because in a path of</p>
<p>temporary immersion, you move into intimacy with this reality, and then you come back out of</p>
<p>it. And then you move into intimacy, and you come back out of it, and it becomes like a love</p>
<p>relationship. But it's a love relationship which actually dissolves the bodies of the two</p>
<p>different beings. The communion that arises is it's a deep and profound spiritual communion. And</p>
<p>so I just adopted the vocabulary that felt most natural to me, and I called it my beloved, the</p>
<p>beloved. And so yes, to me, the beloved manifests itself at all sorts of different levels.</p>
<p>It's manifesting itself at the early level, early stages,</p>
<p>the middle stages, and the advanced stages. But in the end,</p>
<p>you recognize that you're always in dialogue with this profound creative intelligence, which</p>
<p>interestingly enough feels more like a she, in my experience, than a he. And I associate the</p>
<p>feminine side of God with the act of creation. And what you might think of as the masculine side</p>
<p>of God, as the radically transcendent aspect of the basic idea is that the primal one divides</p>
<p>into two. One stays outside of space-time, the other manifests space and time, and</p>
<p>manifests all life within space and time. So for me, the beloved is more the feminine</p>
<p>side of the divine, the divine mother. Yes, it seems that light is a theme in your</p>
<p>experiences. And also, how much of a role did or does love play in</p>
<p>these experiences for you? It played, eventually, a very large</p>
<p>role. There were some sessions in which I encountered or was blessed with experiences of</p>
<p>cosmic love. And it's love not like anything I'd ever experienced before. It just absolutely</p>
<p>shatters me and overwhelmed me. I experienced that all of existence was generated not out of</p>
<p>simply a sheer power. Can you think of the power of the Big Bang and everything that emerged</p>
<p>from it? Not only the intelligence there, but that love, a profound cosmic love,</p>
<p>why is it the very act of creation itself? And that's obviously a kind of love that's not</p>
<p>like anything that we know in human parlance. It's not anything nearly that small. But it</p>
<p>is the fiber of the divine itself. And I think as love and oneness are kind of two</p>
<p>different sides of the reality. Because love, if the world is truly one, if it's all one,</p>
<p>love is the emotion of this oneness. Love is the fact of oneness asserting itself in a world of</p>
<p>duality. Yeah, love has been really important, which really surprised me because of the four</p>
<p>yogas in Hinduism, Jñāna, the path of the mind, Rāja, the path of meditation, Karma yoga, Bhakti</p>
<p>yoga, Bhakti yoga, the yoga of loving devotion. It's a form of yoga that I identified with the</p>
<p>least. I've always been more intellectually oriented, meditatively oriented, not Bhakti</p>
<p>oriented. And yet I began to have a series of very profound Bhakti experiences that it's kind</p>
<p>of what led me to talk about the beloved in this very lover kind of context. How much</p>
<p>is love the fabric of the divine? Anything I say at this point, I mean, first</p>
<p>of all, please forgive my hubris at daring to describe the nature of the divine. I mean,</p>
<p>come on, get real. I mean, this is just like... So anything I say is going to be totally</p>
<p>inadequate to the reality itself. So we describe the divine nature as infinite</p>
<p>knowledge, infinite power, infinite love. All of those are equally true, and I'm</p>
<p>sure that there are other qualities which we want to add to that.</p>
<p>But let's start with those three. The challenge, I think, of understanding</p>
<p>the love aspect of the divine is because life as we experience it is an often dirty, nasty, mean,</p>
<p>cruel thing. And so any suggestion that somehow the world as we know it with all of its pain and suffering is somehow a manifestation of a</p>
<p>supremely loving consciousness, it's horrendously difficult to reconcile those. And I understand</p>
<p>that. I mean, as a philosopher of religion, I understand the challenge. And I think the only</p>
<p>way of overcoming that challenge is to really understand the deep structure or the deep</p>
<p>intentionality that's manifesting itself in the creation itself, in our evolving</p>
<p>universe, in the project of the universe. You have to radically expand your time horizon to</p>
<p>understand what's taking place here. You have to understand that the human condition as we</p>
<p>currently know it is just a small dot in a long developmental process that not only has been</p>
<p>going on for 13.7 billion years, but will continue to go on for 13.7 plus more years. So that, as</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo said, we are a transitional species. We are actualizing ourselves within a long</p>
<p>developmental trajectory. And if we think that, well, God must not be real because we could</p>
<p>have done a better job creating the universe. If I had infinite power, I could have certainly</p>
<p>created a better universe than this where children die and all the terrible things that happen to</p>
<p>us. But that assumes that we know what the divine intention is, what the project of existence is.</p>
<p>And I think we are like children in a playpen. We are just beginning to get a grip on the</p>
<p>enormity of the project of existence. We're just beginning, really since Hubble, in modern</p>
<p>theories of cosmology, beginning to understand the size and depth and textures. I think</p>
<p>psychedelics are kind of like the Hubble of psychological insight. They are giving us an</p>
<p>experience of the depth in which consciousness exists. But that just gets us at the beginning</p>
<p>of beginning to comprehend what is the project. What will humanity be five billion years from</p>
<p>now? What will we be a million years from now, or even a hundred thousand years from now?</p>
<p>The divine seems to think on that scale. So we have to radically stretch</p>
<p>ourselves to think on that scale. So the problem of suffering really challenges</p>
<p>our understanding of the role of love, the principle of love in the divine nature. But</p>
<p>once we have an experiential access to some of the deeper trajectories of the divine</p>
<p>intent, then things begin to make more sense. I think the divine is creating a masterpiece.</p>
<p>I mean, I think refined, elevated, potentiated human experience is a masterpiece</p>
<p>of creation that takes thousands, thousands, millions of years, billions of years</p>
<p>to orchestrate and to bring forward, especially since it's not done. We intentionally</p>
<p>cooperate and participate in this creative process. It's not being done to us. It's</p>
<p>something we are carrying forward in the very fiber of our being. But we really have</p>
<p>to kind of grasp the scale of things to even understand our present circumstances.</p>
<p>At the same time, it sounds like you found that the Atman is Brahman, that you found that we are</p>
<p>part of the divine and the divine is part of us. Yeah. And really, there's very little that's</p>
<p>new in any of the experiences that I lay out. The vision of reality, the cosmology that emerges</p>
<p>out of psychedelic work is fundamentally the same as the cosmology that emerges out of deep mystical</p>
<p>spiritual traditions in the very highest and most refined levels of spiritual traditions in the</p>
<p>world. It's not that we're bringing something new to the table, maybe a little bit, but we're</p>
<p>not bringing a whole lot of new to the table. What we have is a different protocol, a different</p>
<p>strategy for accessing these very deep levels of reality, which yield deep insights into the</p>
<p>structure of existence. But you will find the same fundamental cosmology emerging out of</p>
<p>the great spiritual traditions of the world. Since you brought up the</p>
<p>Hubble telescope, and we've primarily been talking about what we consider</p>
<p>just another word as consciousness, what did you discover in our universe, what we consider</p>
<p>as sort of the physical universe, what we consider as space or outer space?</p>
<p>Did you traverse that aspect of experience in your sessions?</p>
<p>I wasn't taken into journeys into our galaxy or journeys into other galaxies.</p>
<p>That just wasn't part of the work for me. Other people may have those experiences or have had</p>
<p>those experiences. So while I was given this particular session called the cosmic tour,</p>
<p>I called it the cosmic tour, where I was taken on this cosmic tour</p>
<p>and shown so many things, much of which I could not reproduce when I</p>
<p>came back into my time-space consciousness, because my time-space consciousness just did</p>
<p>not have the vocabulary, the intellectual tools to articulate those. That's why I've often wished</p>
<p>that I had a PhD in physics and astrophysics, that I would better be able to articulate</p>
<p>some of the experiences that I was given. But I didn't spend a lot of time traveling</p>
<p>within time and space. It was more a matter of going underneath time and space and getting into</p>
<p>the underlying deep structure that informs time and space and our experience in time and space.</p>
<p>I feel like I recall in your book that you were shown that the universe, I think you've already</p>
<p>said this, goes on and on essentially. Is that right? Do I recall that correctly? Yeah.</p>
<p>Basically, there are two different models of the universe. One is that it'll keep expanding</p>
<p>forever. And the other is that we reach a point where there's a maximum expansion, and then</p>
<p>it begins a contraction. So is it a pulsating universe, expanding and contracting, and then</p>
<p>re-expanding? Or is it an infinitely expanding universe? I don't really have an</p>
<p>answer to that particular question, but clearly the universe is</p>
<p>just, it's on a tear. It's on a tear. It's going on for billions</p>
<p>and billions and billions of years. Now, that's a deflating insight if you think that</p>
<p>a human being is simply a 100-year-old being. If we're simply a 100-year-old being, then we're</p>
<p>basically sand on the beach beside the ocean. We don't really get to participate in that deep</p>
<p>future. But if reincarnation is true, and I think there's plenty of factual evidence that it's true,</p>
<p>if reincarnation is true, and if it's true that our essence is indestructible, and that we take</p>
<p>everything that we've learned and roll it over to continue learning over thousands and thousands</p>
<p>and millions of years, then we get to actually participate in this divine unfolding. It's not</p>
<p>somebody else's future or some other future, but it's our future. We are co-participants,</p>
<p>eternal participants in this eternal process. Mm-hmm. In your experiences, you talked</p>
<p>about the birth of the future human. Yeah. Can you shed a little</p>
<p>light on what that is about? Yeah. Yeah, there's a chapter in the book</p>
<p>called The Birth of the Future Human, and I really think this is maybe the</p>
<p>most important chapter of the book, and it's also the one that</p>
<p>caught me completely by surprise. I wasn't expecting anything like this in my</p>
<p>journey. I thought first it was a personal journey about personal healing,</p>
<p>personal awakening. Then when that expanded, I still thought, okay,</p>
<p>it's a journey about an individual being given experiences that provide insight into the deep</p>
<p>structure underlying our lives. But then about halfway through my work, starting in around 1990</p>
<p>and continuing through 1995, I began to be given a series of visions that were internally consistent,</p>
<p>that were dropped into my sessions talking about humanity's evolutionary destiny,</p>
<p>where humanity was in its evolutionary journey, that we were coming into a</p>
<p>turning point in history, that we were coming into a culmination, a crescendo of the</p>
<p>evolutionary journey that was going to catalyze a transformation inside humanity that would</p>
<p>mark a true before and after moment in time. There was a profound spiritual transformation</p>
<p>that was coming to a crescendo, coming to a head, and this kept repeating itself</p>
<p>in my work in different ways. But I did not know how the universe was ever</p>
<p>going to pull this off. It didn't show me how it was going to happen. Then about a year and</p>
<p>a half later, when I was in the middle of the diamond luminosity work, so I was working</p>
<p>at a very deep level, in one particular day, I was given an experience taken far into</p>
<p>the future. I had died and dissolved into the human psyche. So when I say I was taken</p>
<p>into the future, it's not so much that Chris Bache was taken into the future. It's like, as</p>
<p>the human family, I experienced the human family in a trans-temporal dimension of</p>
<p>time, in a time-expanded state, and I experienced in an accelerated way the</p>
<p>death and rebirth of the entire human family. I experienced a profound geopolitical crisis that</p>
<p>seemed to be being seeded by a cascading series of ecological crises, but I experienced some type</p>
<p>of fundamental loss of control, an unraveling of life at the basic level, a tremendous global</p>
<p>crisis that was so deep and so profound that no one was going to be able to isolate</p>
<p>themselves or protect themselves from it. It was a crisis so deep</p>
<p>it was going to bring humanity to our collective knees.</p>
<p>But just when the crisis reached its peak, I experienced that we moved through it, and then</p>
<p>there was the beginning of a lightning. We made it through this crisis, and when we began to pick</p>
<p>ourselves up in this post-crisis period of history, we've discovered</p>
<p>that we had been profoundly changed. Something happened in this crisis that</p>
<p>opened us up, changed us at the very center of our being. One way of talking about it is that</p>
<p>there was a birth of oneness, that oneness, instead of being a private mystical experience</p>
<p>of a very select few, oneness was born within the human psyche as a whole. We tapped into a certain</p>
<p>depth of our nature that allowed us to become, first of all, it allowed us to become no</p>
<p>longer enemies with all of the human beings, all the divisions of history that have been used</p>
<p>to justify differences of race, differences of class structure, differences of religion, all</p>
<p>those differences which we think of and have used to divide history, national identity, all those</p>
<p>were dissolved, all those were transcended, and we began to experience a fundamental</p>
<p>oneness at the core of our life and all life itself. This led to creativity began to reinforce</p>
<p>itself, and we began to create new social forms, new structures. Eventually, over time, I</p>
<p>came to understand that what this was about was that there was a pressure building</p>
<p>up within the collective psyche, and that this pressure was taking humanity</p>
<p>through a collective death-rebirth process that represented a fundamental irreversible shift</p>
<p>in the collective psyche. I think of it as a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche so</p>
<p>that any child born after we make this transition will be operating within a psychic field which</p>
<p>is fundamentally different, more elevated, more spiritually informed</p>
<p>than we are operating out of now or we've been operating out of the past. This isn't simply a crisis with economic</p>
<p>ramifications or industrial ramifications or political or civic ramifications. It's</p>
<p>a revolution in the fundamental structure of the human psyche. It's a revolution in our</p>
<p>human nature. Now, I think that we have entered this period, this process. I think we're in</p>
<p>the very early stages of it. We're just getting started on it. I think the</p>
<p>21st century will be pivotal in going through this transformative crisis.</p>
<p>I wasn't given a lot of details on names, dates, and places and stuff like that. What I was given</p>
<p>was this core experience of what it's going to feel like for the human</p>
<p>family when they go through a collective dark night of the soul, go through</p>
<p>a collective ordeal that eventually will awaken an underlying revolution in the human psyche,</p>
<p>a spiritual opening of the human psyche. Now, I'm not alone. This is nothing unique to me.</p>
<p>This is an insight that many spiritual teachers have had, many indigenous people</p>
<p>have had. Many psychedelicists have tapped into this understanding.</p>
<p>I think this is the flow of history underneath us that we can tap into in different ways. I think</p>
<p>many of the spiritual mystical traditions have tapped into and begin to</p>
<p>understand some of this dynamic, but I think we're coming into a century</p>
<p>where we are at a critical turning point. I really believe that the 21st century is</p>
<p>pivotal here because if we just look at the scientific data on the ecological crisis,</p>
<p>if we look at what is now an increasingly shared understanding of the depth of</p>
<p>ecological disruption that we're going into and the change of interrupting. Well, I won't</p>
<p>go into the scientific material but clearly we cannot continue on earth operating the</p>
<p>way that we had been operating in the past. We don't have enough resources. Inequality is</p>
<p>just too extreme. I don't think we can continue to govern the earth out of the psychological</p>
<p>structure of the ego. The ego is fundamentally a divided psychic structure. I think the ego</p>
<p>is a beautiful thing. It's a magnificent thing but it fundamentally is cut off from the core of</p>
<p>existence, the foundation of existence and each other. We need to evolve into a higher level of</p>
<p>consciousness which is post-egoic in order to have the wisdom to rise to the challenges that</p>
<p>the ego has created for humanity over its last 1000 year history. And I think we will. I think</p>
<p>we will come through this crisis. I think we're going to go through unbelievable suffering in</p>
<p>the centuries ahead but I do believe that we come through it because that at least has been the</p>
<p>nature of my experience. We do come through this and humanity does make this evolutionary pivot.</p>
<p>Well, I know there's more you can share about this topic and I think we'll do a whole other</p>
<p>conversation about the birth of a future human and also we want to talk more about reincarnation.</p>
<p>Can you share why you stopped these LSD sessions in 1999? Well, I talk about this in the book</p>
<p>in the last chapter coming off the mountain and I basically boil it down to two reasons,</p>
<p>pain and heartache. My subtle energy system, psychedelic states open you up to huge flows of</p>
<p>energy. You're taking in enormous flows of energy. It takes years and years to manage the flows</p>
<p>of energy and I basically realized that I was running so hot that even months after my session</p>
<p>was over, I was permanently uncomfortable in my body because of the quantity of energy that was</p>
<p>running in my subtle energy system, my chi system or my prana. So that was telling me that it was</p>
<p>time to let my body calm down and let that subtle energy system find a new equilibrium point. But</p>
<p>the main reason I stopped was because of heartache because once you dissolve into the divine light,</p>
<p>once you dissolve into diamond luminosity and dissolve into the crystalline nature of</p>
<p>consciousness at this very, very deep level, coming back into time and space is just difficult.</p>
<p>It's very hard. You lose your zest for living inside time and space when you know how much more</p>
<p>is available to you outside of time and space. And going into and coming out of and going into</p>
<p>and coming out of this just became too painful. And so eventually my beloved and I came</p>
<p>to an agreement that I would not return to these states of consciousness</p>
<p>until I could stay with her forever. And that's really what lies behind</p>
<p>my stopping. I just had to stop and for the rest of my life focus on internalizing</p>
<p>the gifts that I had already been given rather than trying to acquire</p>
<p>or be given more gifts. You've been in communication with Stanislav Grof</p>
<p>and Ralph Metzner who are pioneers in this area of psychedelics and psychological</p>
<p>consciousness, cosmic exploration. Have you shared your experiences with them</p>
<p>and what have they shared with you about that? I've been in dialogue with both of them and I have</p>
<p>shared my sessions with Stan and he quotes from some of my sessions scattered throughout his</p>
<p>books. Some of them are anonymous and in some later works they're identified as mine.</p>
<p>And Stan very graciously wrote a beautiful forward to my book Dark Night Early Dawn which</p>
<p>was my first major book on psychedelic work, psychedelic theory. I think that there's a</p>
<p>fundamental, I mean we have different projects, different agendas. I mean Stan is a therapist,</p>
<p>he's a world healer. He has worked with thousands of individuals and collected thousands and</p>
<p>thousands of session experiences and organized them into an understanding</p>
<p>of the vast scope of the landscape that one experiences in these states. My work has been different. I've really been</p>
<p>doing an individual journey penetrating deeper and deeper into the universe. So I see</p>
<p>our work as complementary in that way. But yeah, I've been in dialogue with both</p>
<p>of them. Yeah, I love them both very dearly. Ralph has now transitioned on. I love them dearly.</p>
<p>We've been in dialogue. Ralph gave me feedback on LSD and the Mind of the Universe before I</p>
<p>published it. So yeah, I consider them close colleagues and good friends. So they were</p>
<p>supportive of your process? Yes, yeah. That's wonderful. The last area I want to touch</p>
<p>on with you is that of course people listening, some may think, well how much can we trust</p>
<p>these experiences? And I know that you had a conversation or an interaction with Kenneth</p>
<p>Ring who is the co-founder of the International Association for Near Death Studies. I was</p>
<p>wondering if you could share a little bit about your correspondence with him or what you have to</p>
<p>say about how much we can trust your experiences? Yeah, that's a really important question. I</p>
<p>mean, how do we know that we aren't simply exploring some hidden corner of my</p>
<p>personal unconscious or even some hidden corner of the collective psyche, I</p>
<p>mean, I know I understand how radical the assertions that I'm making, making them sound</p>
<p>almost cavalier. How do we know that we can trust these experiences to be what I'm suggesting that</p>
<p>they are? And Ken Ring and I had a dialogue about this. Ken is a wonderful scholar and he's a good</p>
<p>friend. And so after he had read LSD and the Mind of the Universe, he wrote me and we went back and</p>
<p>forth around precisely this issue. How trustable are these deep psychedelic experiences? How</p>
<p>do we know that they're not better understood as a manifestation of something coming out of</p>
<p>the personal psyche or the collective psyche, that they really have these metaphysical</p>
<p>ontological ramifications that I've been interpreting them to have? And so he and I went</p>
<p>back and forth in an exchange of letters about this. And Ken worked me over pretty hard. I mean,</p>
<p>he was asking hard questions and I loved it. And this was a dialogue that was</p>
<p>worth sharing. So we wrote it up in an essay called Are Deep Psychedelic</p>
<p>Experiences Trustable? And we published it online and it's available. If you just Google that title,</p>
<p>you'll find it. And in it, I try to address that specific issue. And I also bring in</p>
<p>other people's experiences which provide levels of objective verification, because</p>
<p>many psychedelic experiences lead us to have experiences that can be verified</p>
<p>because they relate to something inside time and space. The deeper cosmological experiences</p>
<p>cannot be verified in that way, but the existence of verifiable experiences when they refer to time</p>
<p>and space reality certainly points to the credibility of the deeper</p>
<p>cosmological experiences. So I bring in a lot of evidence in the footnotes</p>
<p>and in the literature that speak to the issue of the trustability of these experiences. I</p>
<p>think most of our doubt about their trustability is completely understandable, but I think it comes</p>
<p>from, first, not having personal experience of these states and trying to understand them within</p>
<p>a metaphysical framework that's based upon time of physical sensation experience, mental</p>
<p>experience, sensate experience. We're trying to understand these things within a framework</p>
<p>which is smaller than we want they need to be. It's just like we had to have tens of thousands</p>
<p>of near-death episodes in print and published before the medical community began to take them</p>
<p>seriously because they didn't want to interpret these as an indication of the existence of</p>
<p>spiritual reality. They wanted to interpret it as something going on inside</p>
<p>the physical process. And I think that's true for psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>too. We need to develop a more sophisticated ontology, metaphysical understanding,</p>
<p>even to have a framework for understanding some of these experiences. And this is why</p>
<p>I didn't rush into print on any of these experiences. I mean, after I stopped my work in</p>
<p>99, I really spent 20 years digesting them, analyzing, looking at other people's experiences,</p>
<p>looking at the other metaphysical systems, and trying to put all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle</p>
<p>together before I published LSD in the Mind of the Universe. So a lot of thought, it's not simply,</p>
<p>here's my experience, you can trust it because I had it. It's not that at all. What we really want</p>
<p>is not just one person's experiences, but we want to have a critical protocol which involves</p>
<p>many people's experiences, putting all of our experiences on the table and finding out which</p>
<p>of these experiences are idiosyncratic and which one of them are common ground.</p>
<p>We haven't really begun that work yet. We're in the early stages of doing that. But psychedelics</p>
<p>are not going to go away. We're going to be using them for decades and hundreds of years to come.</p>
<p>And this challenge of collective verification of the visions that emerge in these states</p>
<p>is just getting started, is just moving forward. It sounds like you're suggesting that</p>
<p>we need more research in this area, which can be tricky because of the taboo and</p>
<p>the legalities around it. Although it seems that with other studies on psilocybin and other</p>
<p>psychedelics that maybe that's beginning to shift. I think it is beginning to shift. I think</p>
<p>what's happening is the psychedelic community is demonstrating with increasing convincing</p>
<p>research that these substances have a tremendous power to heal. And that's what's bringing them</p>
<p>back into public discussion. We're going to find over time that the same amplifying qualities</p>
<p>which allow them to have a therapeutic impact continue. If we continue to apply these</p>
<p>methodologies, they continue to open up deeper and deeper levels of consciousness. And</p>
<p>when we get deep enough, eventually we'll begin to harvest the philosophical and cosmological</p>
<p>significance of these substances. I gave a talk at the Erotas Conference at Oxford last fall,</p>
<p>and I called it Seizing the Philosophical and Cosmological Significance of Psychedelics. We're</p>
<p>not there yet, but I think we're going there. We will get there to move in this direction.</p>
<p>Well, Chris, I know this is a very large topic, and I just want to ask this last question,</p>
<p>and I'm excited we're going to have another conversation. Is there anything you want to share</p>
<p>more today about psychedelics and the cosmic mind? I want to return again to the cautionary</p>
<p>words that we shared in the very beginning. This is deep, challenging, demanding work. You</p>
<p>do not try to climb Mount Everest unless you have all the best equipment and all the best guides</p>
<p>going with you. You do not want to go deep into the psyche unless you have all the best equipment</p>
<p>and the best context for doing this type of work. So I want to affirm that. I want to affirm</p>
<p>the importance of a rigorous protocol. If you want to go deep, you have to have a</p>
<p>particularly rigorous protocol, first just to survive the encounter, but also to take</p>
<p>experiences and distill them into increasingly clear, clear, articulate experiences that are</p>
<p>not lost. Your mind just doesn't swallow them up. You can really bring back the core of the</p>
<p>experience. Once you do that, once you've taken all the cautions, all the precautions, and once</p>
<p>you have spent time doing your due diligence in this, then I think we are at the cusp of</p>
<p>a completely new chapter in philosophy of consciousness, a new chapter in our understanding</p>
<p>what is happening in existence. Why is human existence the way it is? Why is existence the way</p>
<p>it is? What's going on underneath the surface? What is the nature of the intelligence</p>
<p>that's manifesting the body of the universe? What is the nature of the</p>
<p>intelligence manifesting inside our own hearts and mind over time?</p>
<p>This, I think, is the beginning of a whole new chapter of philosophical and</p>
<p>spiritual reflection. In conclusion, I just want to leave with your viewers a sense of</p>
<p>excitement or this tremendous turning point that we are at, this pivot point of this profound</p>
<p>deepening of our understanding of our experience of these deep structures of reality and a</p>
<p>deepening of our understanding of what's taking place behind the scenes and the opportunity</p>
<p>to enter into conscious communion with the of our existence, which was previously maybe</p>
<p>just the privileged domain of very, very advanced meditative and contemplative mystics, but now</p>
<p>we have a new modality that allows even ordinary human beings to have just a touch taste of</p>
<p>these experiences, which can be life-changing. And for people to know the risks and the benefits,</p>
<p>right? Because each person might have a different reaction or response to these kinds of</p>
<p>substances. Yeah, there are screening criteria and more important, more criteria that</p>
<p>would be… which are used in order to make sure people who do this</p>
<p>work are safe and only people who should do this work do do this work.</p>
<p>Chris, thank you so much for being with me today. Thank you so much for going beyond the beyond and</p>
<p>bringing it back for all of us. I really have enjoyed our conversation and I look forward to</p>
<p>our next one. Thank you, Emmy. I have enjoyed our conversation too. Thank you for the work you're</p>
<p>doing. We need all the wisdom we can get in the years ahead. Yes. And for those of you watching</p>
<p>or listening, thank you for being with us because you are the reason that we are here.</p>

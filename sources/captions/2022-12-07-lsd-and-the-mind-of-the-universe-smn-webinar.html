      <p>[Music] and a warm welcome everybody I'm tuning in here from the Catholic area of Southwest France as many of you will know my name is David Larimer I'm the program director of the scientific and medical Network so Chris Chris I've known Chris for a long time and he's he taught for for 33 years at the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University and is also connected with the ciis California Institute of integral studies and neurotic sciences and he's an advisor to the Groff Legacy training which I'm also involved in and he said he writes here that his passion has been the study and the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of Consciousness particularly psychedelic States and I'd like to add a plug as it were for his book that um isn't on this particular theme the living classroom um an exploration of collective fields of Consciousness and teaching and this is particularly fascinating in terms of the the synchronicities that um seem to arise in in Chris's teaching and with his students and and he may refer to that in passing um so his two books that I've read and reviewed and this is the initial one here Dark Knight early door and I think that's exactly where we are collectively at the moment and then his book prize winning book LSD in the mind of the universe and many of you will have read his article in the current issue of Paradigm Explorer so Chris I'm really looking forward to this presentation very warm welcome from us and we can't wait to hear what you have to say thank you David let me shift into screen sharing if I can do this correctly good okay well thank you David and thank you everybody it's an honor and a pleasure to be here with you tonight uh and I really look forward to sharing with you the experiences that I'm reporting in this book LSD in the mind of the universe this evening is a question of whether we can all participate all access the cosmic mind I'm assuming using psychedelics well I believe that we all can but whether we all should is another matter entirely in contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to Mystical experience my concern is that the Psychedelic journey into the cosmic mine is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution an LSD in the mind of the Universe I try to describe as clearly and carefully as I can experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old and this was 1979 to 1999 I spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences digesting them mapping them and pondering their implications I hope that the visions that I brought back from this journey will be useful not only to other Psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves because what's important here is the vision of the cosmos that they contain and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point that we are coming to now I want to say up front before we begin that I'm not sure that what I did was wise I pushed myself very hard on this journey harder than was sometimes good for me and I sincerely do not recommend this protocol to others if I were starting this journey over again I would be gentler with myself I would work with lower Doses and gentler psychedelics but I made it through intact and I would not have missed it for the world I also want to say that I know that what I'm presenting tonight is a radical story I know it raises many questions that we won't get to speak about tonight about the reality of these experiences about how this path compares to other spiritual paths but this radical nature is inescapable I believe that psychedelics represent a genuine turning point in philosophy a true before and after advance they give us more than new insights into Consciousness and more than a new therapeutic method for healing the wounds of the personal psyche as important as these things are the critical use of psychedelics gives us a new philosophical method that has two parts first immersing ourselves into temporary states of hyper aroused Consciousness and second stepping back and critically analyzing our experiences there by moving back and forth between non-ordinary and ordinary States Of Consciousness we can gather and distill new insights into the structure of reality now of course this method is not really new is it it was present in the ellessinian mysteries of ancient Greece and in the Ayahuasca ceremonies of Brazil that date back a thousand years but they are new to us new to our scientific culture and that's the point we are witnessing I think the emergence of a true psychedelic philosophy so let's begin my psychedelic lineage is rooted in the work of stanislav Groff I was a brand new faculty member in 1978 when I first read his book Realms of the human unconscious and my life pivoted that was followed quickly by his book LSD Psychotherapy in 1980 in which he laid out the method for working with these substances now Stan has demonstrated that LSD is a non-specific amplifier and Catalyst of consciousness it does not give us specific experiences rather it hypersensitizes one's Consciousness for six to eight hours at a time everything that follows hinges on how we use these hours now stands work clearly differentiates two different therapeutic modalities cyclitic therapy low-dose therapy and psychedelic therapy high-dose therapy in cyclistic therapy the mind is peeled away layer by layer uncovering the different layers of our shadow and taking us back deeper and deeper into our unconscious and psychedelic therapy this is a very different protocol it was developed and used at Spring Grove Hospital it was limited to three sessions maximum and it was designed to trigger a near-death type experiences among patients who were terminally ill well I thought if you could use this therapy of hide working with high doses safely three times you could use it working safely more than three times so during the years I was doing this work I simply saw myself as doing an extended course of psychedelic therapy but when I came to the end of this journey and was looking back over its length I came to appreciate how radical this undertaking had actually been this went beyond psychedelic therapy as it was originally conceived and practiced and therefore it called for a new term to avoid confusion and so I've named it psychedelic exploration now I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms this is a very high dose level the method is the method of psychedelic therapy complete isolation and complete protection from the outside world trusting your care to a sitter wearing eyes Shades and working with very carefully chosen music to Pace the opening and closing of your session the difference is the high number of sessions in my case 73 times now I think that the stabilization of the protocol in minimizing the variables that I followed in my session contributed to the stability and Clarity of the Psychedelic window that opened in my session so I always follow the same protocol the same sentence setting the same sitter who was my former wife my wife at the time Carol who is a clinical psychologist same substance the same dose level even the same location and the same recording process I think this provided a very stable reception platform that allowed my sessions to develop clearly over time now I did this work as rigorously as I could I kept detailed records making an exhaustive descriptive account within 24 hours of each session I tracked the dates and that's Rick tarnis is a good friend of mine and I've learned as we've all read his book psycheon Cosmos I tracked the astrological variables to see what the interplay was between my experiences and the astrological transits now I want to emphasize that the story that I'm telling in LSD in the mind of the universe is not primarily a personal story it it's primarily a cosmological story the personal is the least important in my experiences after the first 10 sessions or so the portion of the experiences that were relevant to my personal life tended to come up in the beginning and endings of the sessions represented by these small circles that are drawn at the beginning and endings of these sine waves which represents psychedelic sessions when I was coming back leaving and coming back into space-time I often had many insights and many gifts given me about my personal life but when I was in the peak hours of psychedelic arousal I was at the top of these waves and experiencing I was having experiences at far transcended my personal life as represented in these larger circles and that's the story I'm telling in LSD in the mind of the universe that's the philosophically interesting story that is the universal story and it's a story which is basically telling the developmental sequence of experiences over these Hilltop perspectives now there are many ways in which you can use psychedelics let me identify three uses first is using it in a to for therapeutic healing to heal the wounds of our personal psyche this is the dominant form in which psychedelics are being used and studied today second is to use them for Spiritual Awakening to cultivate that radical transparent condition of our being in which we stand completely conscious completely naked and completely receptive to the ever-changing field of experience the third usage is cosmological exploration these are distinct if mutually reinforcing undertakings how you use psychedelics dose levels circumstances set in setting are different in each of these settings and I think it's important to make sure that we don't judge one project by criteria that are relevant to another project okay now in these experiences ah when one works with very high doses of LSD one goes through a series of death rebirth experiences in this image the drop at the center underneath the line represents our egoic Consciousness our private Consciousness everything above the line represents spiritual reality transpersonal consciousness the first death rebirth experience takes place at the interface of our time space Consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness and it's usually referred to as ego death it is the complete destruction of our personal time space identity and the beginning of an opening into spiritual reality but if we continue this process if we press deeper and deeper into spiritual reality we go through more deaths more cycles of death and rebirth at the psychic subtle and causal levels of consciousness to use terms that Stan uses now I have no vested interest in a particular cosmological map that delineates the various strata strata of transpersonal Consciousness here I'm simply trying to make a point that as you go into deeper levels of consciousness you come to certain gateways and at these gateways you must give up everything everything you have known up to this point in time in your journey in order to enter into the new fields of Consciousness that are beginning to open to you Now One does not simply enter into spiritual reality and pluck these experiences from the universe like one plucks an apple from a tree drawing on Jorge ferra's insights in his wonderful book revisiting transpersonal Theory I hold that all psychedelic experience is participatory this means that our being evokes in complex ways that portion of the universe that we encounter our mind acts as a seed Crystal that catalyzes a certain set of experiences from the cosmic Minds infinite potential as we are gradually purified and transformed by this process it evokes still deeper experiences from the universe in my experience one session more or less started where the previous session stopped there was a gradual and consistent unfolding into deeper and deeper levels of reality this may not be true in other people's experiences it simply is true oh I'm let me give you a different image for this process LSD is often likened to the atomic bomb which was invented in the same decade here I'm using the nuclear explosion as an image of the type of combust combustive fire that is generated in a long series of sessions that generates this cycle of death and rebirth and as this cycle continues it activates and brings into our conscious awareness deeper levels of the of the universe just as this nuclear explosion brings into visible form different levels of the atmosphere there were always there from the beginning but were basically hidden and invisible and it is the power of the Psychedelic Dynamic that brings these dimensions of existence into our into our conscious awareness now we're not talking about nuclear explosions we're talking about an exploration into the mind of the universe an exploration into the cosmic mind when I was at the end of my journey and looking back over its length identified different strata different layers that I had entered systematically over the course of these 20 years and I would count five of them the first having to do with my personal mind the second having to do with Collective mind the mind of our species third having to do with archetypal mind the fourth causal Oneness and the fifth Diamond luminosity so what I'd like to do now is simply take you into the book chapter by chapter with just a few highlighted comments of the content of each chapter just to illustrate just to invite you into the dialogue that you will find unfolded in LSD in the mind of the universe so first the personal mind there is a chapter crossing the boundary of birth and death this refers to Crossing what Stan calls the perinatal level of consciousness now there is a previous chapter the chapter on methodology where I lay out the method of the work and there is a chapter three in which I basically take the reader into a typical session day to show them what it's like but contact wise We Begin here now if you're familiar with Stan Groff's work and I'm assuming most of you are this is classic perinatal material con deep confrontations with death and Fetal Sensations severe existential confrontations tremendous perinatal seizures purifying the body and the emotional field culminating in ego death and an ego death our identity our time space identity is just turned inside out in my case my ego death I was forced to become the exact opposite of everything I had ever known myself to be the universe just reached down and snapped me like a trick a twig in the beginning of the day I had always known myself as being male as being an intellectual being college educated and being passionately interested in the meaning of life in this session I was forced to become the complete opposite of all these things and it was as if the universe was telling me where you are going gender does not exist I had to let go of everything I was in order to go into what was coming next and what was coming next really surprised me in what I later came to call the exercises of Collective death and rebirth and the ocean of suffering over the course of two years I was repeatedly and systematically immersed in experiences of collective anguish that shattered all my frames of reference and completely dwarfing the previous phase I entered a notion of suffering that eventually expanded systematically to Encompass what appeared to be the entire history of the human species the dying in these sessions was almost entirely Collective the surrender that was demanded was the ordeal of repeatedly opening to the sheer enormity and savagery savagery of this ocean of pain now first I thought this represented a deepening of ego death but it went on for so long and it involved so many beings that eventually I changed my mind I came to the conclusion that these Collective episodes were not primarily aimed at the transformation of my personal consciousness they were aimed at healing some portion of the collective unconscious of humanity healing scars accumulated through history and still carried in our Collective memory now in my experience in a session there are essentially two phases there is the first phase the cleansing phase purification phase and the second phase the ecstatic phase the ocean of suffering I said lasted two years actually it lasted one year and then I took a six year break and then it I started again and the ocean of suffering resumed in that first year when I went into the ecstatic phase of the sessions I entered what I came to call Deep time in the chapter deep time in the soul when I would come out of the ocean of suffering I entered a state in which these seven sessions gave me an experience of my life as a completed whole as a totality from beginning to end the Visions were stable and systematically developed each session built upon the previous session the sessions their sequences were repeated unfolding in Greater detail and with deepening emphasis now I found that it was an EXT roordinary challenge to hold on to these experiences of deep time the first time I came back from Deep time the experiences which had been the most meaningful experiences of my life at that point in time I could not hold on to them my mind had nowhere to place that with repetition when I would go back to the same state of consciousness again and again I was able to hold on to more and more of the experiences and this is an important epistemological point you have to train yourself to stay conscious in these deep States Of Consciousness you have to undergo rigorous systematic commitment to learning how to stay awake in States Of Consciousness said that in the beginning completely swallow you a pull but if you practice you can maintain epistemological Clarity in these states so during this year I had many teachings about reincarnation about karmic cause and effect and the deeper intentionality operating in life and then I stopped my work for six years for reasons that I described in the book when I resumed six years later the ocean of suffering started exactly where it had stopped before and continued to build an intensity over the remaining year seven more sessions in a different time of my life with different expectations and under different astrological transits the ocean of suffering began exactly where it had stopped which I think reflects the depth and power of the intelligence and Consciousness that is directing these episodes certainly not my intelligence something larger than my intelligence when I went into the ecstatic portion of these sessions I entered a completely different reality than deep time in the soul I entered in a sense what I came to call an initiation into the universe it did involve transcending time in different ways but I was given a systematic series of initiations into the universe and into the creative intelligence behind the physical universe the sequence was deliberate and well crafted it felt like an infinite intelligence was educating me reminding me of things long ago forgotten but now in need of being remembered now little note I give my psychedelic sessions names I take detailed notes I break them down into bullet points and I give them names because my intention is to try to hold all of my experiences in my mind at the same time and so when I see the name of a session it reminds me of the content of the session so the names of the sessions that I address in this chapter are this we don't have time for me to go into these sessions beyond what I've already said the name suggests some of the content it was just an extraordinary philosophical Adventure being taken by what appeared to be the creative intelligence of the universe deeper and deeper into the mysteries of creation and deeper into Humanity's destiny when the ocean of suffering came to a culmination in this session 24 healing the collective wound I was spun into archetypal reality in the chapter the greater real of archetypal reality let me see if I can there we go this lasted one and a half years and 11 sessions was entering a reality that immediately and consistently was more real felt more real Than Physical reality it was a domain behind physical reality and the source of the structures that exist inside space and time when I first entered archetypal reality my identity as a human being began to fall away from me I learned that we have a sense of a sense of species identity that is more basic than our individual identity and surrendering this species identity represented a deeper form of surrender and a deeper death than ego death to die out of human consciousness was to begin to exist in a domain of Consciousness completely beyond the human species field this transition was marked with extremely high levels of energy I was plunged into white hot lava flows exploding sunfair flares Liquid Fire pouring through me completely consuming me very different from the death that I had gone through in the perinatal level of consciousness my experience is an archetypal reality basically could be broken down into two categories two levels one at the highest subtle level and one at the lower subtle level at the higher subtle level which I would call the platonic level I encountered living forms responsible for creating space-time and the core structures within space time they were too vast for me to grasp even in my expanded psychedelic State I could catch only glimpses of them I saw them as galaxies billions of light years across massive structures but this was simply the best my mind could do to wrap itself around the realities that I was experiencing these were archetypes but not Plato's Eternal ideas in the mind of an unchanging God but vast living Dynamic forces embodying higher orders of intentionality and power and operating on a different order of time entirely at the lower subtle level at a more jungian level I was immersed in the living tissue of our species through a long series of experiences I was repeatedly experiencing our species as a single organism interlaced with an intelligent network of meta functions I experienced all of our individual Minds as nodal points within the collective mind I experienced all the issues that we'd confront in our life both psychological issues and biological issues as all part of a larger living tapestry of cause and effect weaving throughout the entire species I experienced our collect our individual bodies as cells within our larger Collective body and I began to have experiences of reincarnation as a collective process up to this point in time I had already experienced reincarnation or thought about reincarnation in terms of a personal Soul generated process and that and it was about our individual Evolution and confronting individual Karma but I had many experiences during this time of our entire species reincarnating with common cause I began to experience billions of human beings incarnating over and over again and driving the evolution of our entire species forward I was given many insights into into the Dynamics of collective purification and Collective transformation and this is why in my book dark night early Dawn the fundamental theme of that book has to do with the processes the Dynamics of collective transformation Dark Knight early Dawn is about the collective Dark Night and the early Dawn is about our Collective transformation and history this was simultaneously a new numinous experience and a devastating experience to experience billions of lives as cells within an organism that was evolving itself on the face of our planet was just a devastating experience and an ecstatic experience Petals of the S of the sessions that I address in this chapter are these you can see how much cleansing is involved even at this rather advanced level and this reflects an important truth deeper levels of reality are higher levels of energy and when one wants to enter if you want to enter and stabilize your Consciousness at these deeper levels of reality you must adapt to and adjust to this energy it's like mountain climbing when you climb a mountain you adapt you're adjusting to less oxygen when you're working through deeper levels of consciousness you're adjusting to more energy you must literally become a being who can sustain these high levels of energy for eight hours at a time session 28 was my first and brief contact with causal level reality it was an exceptionally clear dramatic and beautiful session but just touching the purity of causal level reality was so intense that it triggered hours and hours of cleansing that lasted over three sessions stretched over six months the cleansing was some type of purification process that was making it possible for me to return to this level of reality but to maintain coherent cognitive focus at this deep level which then led to a rather startling experience the Flesh of God in session 33. I entered an extraordinary year of immersion and causal Oneness in a chapter that I call a benediction of blessings it lasted one year in eight sessions so after spending 18 months exploring archetypal reality which of course is very quickly I mean it I just was moving through this material just touching base just moving through very quickly the year that followed was one of extraordinary blessings it was a veritable benediction of blessings as I entered the great depth of causal reality and these are the names of the sessions that I address in the book these were preceded by more experiences of death and more experiences of fierce purification the forest was an experience of causal Oneness of shunyata emptiness of self no self in me no self in any other just as sun and sun and air moves through in a forest without paying any attention to the particular type of tree that is moving through singing the universe away was an experience of the Primal void that Lies Beneath our universe and gives birth to it day by day second by second Jesus's blood was an experience of cosmic love the most intense experience of love that I had ever known in my life and then the birth of the diamond soul and let me mention something about this just very briefly because it it's really a pivotal was a pivotal session for me and it comes up later in the book previously I had experienced My Life as a completed whole now 11 years later I experienced all of my Farmer lives being rewound one by one coming together and being rewound like winding kite string on a spool until eventually the spool exploded in a burst of light fusing all the strands together and giving birth to what I came to call the diamond soul the diamond saw was composed of many lifetimes but it was more than the sum of all their years this experience showed me I think where reincarnation is taking us it would take us too long to go into in great detail but basically I think the visions of reincarnation that we have lived with over the last two thousand years are are incomplete they haven't they have a vision of that we're we're growing incrementally Lifetime by LifeTime becoming more knowing more becoming more compassionate becoming more intelligent incremental adjustments but I think that there is more at foot underneath this process eventually we there Comes A Time through the constant expansion and contraction through dying and returning to the soul and being born and Contracting into the ego and buying and the soul and coming back into the ego eventually there comes a time I believe where all of our farmer lives come together as one and when they come together as one they catapult us into a condition of being which is not simply a refined and purified future life it is a being catapulted into a different order of Life a different order of being itself I think what is happening over the long story of reincarnation is that the soul is being born inside time and space this is what I call the birth of the diamond soul now from here I went into the diamond Luminosity work now notice I've skipped chapter nine I wish I had actually written these in a different order I wish I had had 10 before chapter nine but I'm going to skip over nine for the moment because the work went into the diamond Luminosity material the benediction of blessings felt like the closing of a great circle it gave me a feeling of deep completion a sense of inheriting blessings for work done in the ocean of suffering I had given something to the universe that was mine to give and the universe had given me back more Treasures than I could hold I felt complete and utterly satisfied I had no idea where the sessions would go next but there was still five years ahead after going through yet one more intense cycle of death and rebirth I was spun into a brilliantly clear Radiance that Buddhism calls dharmakaya I came to call it the domain of diamond luminosity now I had known light many times before but this was an exceptionally pure light this domain captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest I had in exploring the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me this was a different order of reality altogether its Clarity was so overwhelming its energy so pure that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions over the next four years in 26 sessions the diamond Luminosity domain opened to me only four times and these are the four sessions that I described that I present in this chapter foreign is that the diamond Luminosity is an extra samsaric reality that is it lies outside the Bardo the outside of samsara outside all the cycles of physical reality in the Bartle realities of psychic reality the pure light it is the pure light from which the universe arises and returns it is dharmakaya the clear light of absolute reality now in between these four immersions in Diamond Luminosity there were many intense episodes of cleansing and personal healing in January there were two movements during this four-year period there was first a movement of going deeper into Diamond luminosity and then a move movement Diamond Luminosity began to Crunch itself more deeply into my physical body and the turning point for this was session 50. I only began to understand what was happening after the fact always I had no control over what was happening in the sessions I had basically went along with whatever the universe was wherever it was taking me and only figured out after the fact what was taking place in session 50 I was as deep into the universe as I ever went in any of my sessions I was in the clearest most Sublime state of diamond Luminosity that I had ever known and then in that session everything in my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and I saw a reality far into the distance that looked like luminous galaxies an array of light from that reality hit me and it absolutely shattered me I call it the absolute light just to give it a name but what it showed me is that the universe that we are exploring in these deep States Of Consciousness is endless I would never get to the end of the Divine mind I would never get to the end of the cosmic mine even using this powerful method of exploration this was a turning point in my thinking because I had adopted the belief that I inherited from other people that there was an end point to this journey that there was the point that you came to which represented your ultimate destination some had described it as Oneness with God or as the return to the Primal void but I had experienced one with Oneness with God many times and what I learned is that there are many permutations and degrees of Oneness and I had entered in the Primal void several times and I learned that there too there are degrees of void when I first entered the diamond Luminosity It came it brought such a feeling of homecoming such a feeling of absolute peace and contentment I thought that I had finally found what I was looking for I had finally found my ultimate destination and then practically I did it completely satisfied all my philosophical and spiritual longing but just at the peak of this satisfaction the universe showed me that it is an infinite Journey it is an infinite being that we are exploring in our lives this both first shattered me and then relaxed me into Infinite wonder and this is one of the reasons why I would be gentler with myself if I were doing this today because one of the things I've learned on this journey is that the goal is not to get somewhere to get to a particular State of Consciousness or particular state of being the goal of this work I think is to open up to the universe and let us much of it as possible into your being to let us much of the love and as much of the intelligence and as much of the power and Consciousness into your being and stabilize it and hold it and live your life living by its truths after this session 50 the next sessions really seem to take me into the diamond light but the diamond light was crunching itself deeper and deeper into my body changing even what I think I have as the physiological structure the cellular structure of my body and now to the chapter I skipped over birth of the future human when I began this work in 1979 I never imagined that Humanity's future would become part of this story but now I think this may be the most important chapter of the book because it speaks of our children and our children's children as far as we can see of a Crossroads humanity is coming to and of powerful forces taking us into a future that will change us at the deepest levels of our being in this chapter I summarized bits and pieces of experiences and visions that actually go all the way back to the initiation into the universe material and run all the way through up into session 55. these are the sessions that I discuss that I presented in this chapter here I collect the pieces of Visions I extract them from sessions 23 to 47 and gather them together in what I call the visions of Awakening the there are six visions of Awakening are six themes that kept showing themselves over and over in these Visions concerning Humanity's future the themes of those six Visions are Divine love all Humanity that the universe is trying to awaken all Humanity that is being enacted by guiding intelligence that's guiding our evolutionary process our species as a single being again seeing the Awakening as not simply a number of individuals or Awakening but our entire species going through the Awakening process the theme of collective purification again through the Dynamics of reincarnation that we are undergoing a collective purification and finally the experience of the future human being given the grace of experiencing the future human that is being born in history but nowhere in these Visions over these four years nowhere in these Visions was it shown me how this was going to take place the vision was that we were coming into a period of profound Spiritual Awakening a shift in the fundamental architecture of the collective psyche a shift that will change the foundation of human existence on this planet but it had not shown me how and then in session 55 right in the middle of the diamond Luminosity sessions I was taken deep into deep time and I was given an experience of the death and Rebirth of humanity well of the death and Rebirth of humanity for there to be a Great Awakening in the human heart in our Collective human heart there must first take place a great death we must be emptied of the old before the new can fully emerge I believe that the 21st century will be such a Time it will begin the dark night of our Collective Soul a time of emptying of intense anguish of loss of control and breakdown a collective purification unto death that will last Generations but through this hard labor we will give birth to something extraordinary more than just a new civilization what is emerging is nothing less than a new order of human being through the Global Systems crisis our planet is giving birth to the Future human now I first describe these themes in dark night early Dawn it sounds quite appropriate for our times that we are living in now but I would just remind you that these Visions were taking place in the early 90s the Great Awakening session took place in 1995. 25 years ago at that time it was completely beyond my purview that we were going into such an enormous watershed moment in history in my Visions concerning the human where humanity is it was as though the transformation of humanity as a whole was the only thing the creative intelligence really cared about everything else my life our lives everything we are struggling with in history was part of this larger project it was the context that framed all of our endeavors it was the work of the hour now my Visions did not give me any details of when and where so don't ask it showed me the fact of this Collective Awakening it took me into the collective psyches experience of this death and rebirth and it gave me insights into the mechanisms of our Collective transformation it's probably not time here to discuss these mechanisms though I think they're really important and it has to do two things with the unified field that the collective species mind is underneath all of our individual experiences and the perception that then the enormous suffering that is being that will be generated by a global ecological crisis leading to a Global Systems crisis this suffering will impact not just individuals but it will actually stimulate the collective psyches so deeply it'll shift the collective psyche into what we would call non-linear conditions and we know something about non-linear systems from physical systems when they are shoved into non-linear States and there is a parallel between what can happen to a psychic system a field of of psychological energy and what happens to physical systems when they are both shoved into non-linear conditions heightened creativity higher self-organization the capacity for rapidly accelerated change and small inputs leading to enormous outcomes the final Vision to bring the journey to a close just touching it very briefly actually the seven the three sessions that I discussed in this chapter the final vision this was one of the most intense sessions that I went through anywhere on my journey in it the universe put me through a strip down that was more violent and more radical than any strip down I had ever gone through at any other time in my journey and it did so I think in order to catapult me more deeply into deep time than did ever taken me before I won't try to reproduce or tell you much about that I will invite you simply to look at it in the book itself it was the final vision given me as a Capstone to the long story of where humanity is going it showed me things about the evolutionary process that I have held dear to my heart ever since it showed me things about our universe that our universe is a diamond maker making Diamond souls and it cares very little whether it takes a million or a billion years for us to interest for it to produce the souls that it is creating and it gave me my deepest experience of the future human an extraordinary being just just an extraordinary being the last chapter is coming off the mountain this chapter was the longest to write and in it I describe two things that I have struggled with and confronted in the years after my journey ended the first I call the deep sadness I had been given so many blessings on this journey I thought that I could simply step away and spend the rest of my life digesting these Treasures but in the Years following my sessions I began to experience a deep existential sadness I had been taken so deep into the Divine into the Divine expanse so many times that I was suffering from a loss of communion with the divine once you have known the joy of becoming light once you have experienced the Ecstasy of dissolving into the crystalline body of God life on Earth can begin to feel dried up I found that I no longer wanted to be here and this is similar to what some people who have near-death episodes experience when they return here they are plunged deeply into the light the Divine Light filled with overwhelming love and then suddenly they're back on Earth with all the limitations of Earthly experience it's hard to make that transition I knew that I was every moment immersed in the body of the Divine I knew that she was the root and the flower of my existence but this knowledge did not save me entirely from the pain of being separated from the full intensity of her presence it took me about 10 years to become fully grounded and comfortable living inside space-time again but there was a second Factor contributing to my disharmony and this is what I call the sickness of Silence because of our restrictive laws around psychedelics I was not allowed to speak about my experience to others I am a natural-born teacher I love to learn new things and share that knowledge but I was not allowed to teach from my psychedelic experiences and the department of philosophy and religious studies I had to keep silent about the most philosophically meaningful experiences of my life how can you behold under such restrictive conditions over time this enforced silence made me sick inside living in a psychedelic closet is just as damaging to your soul as living in any other closet where you are forced to deny your true nature writing LSD in the mind of the universe and speaking openly about my psychedelic experiences as I'm speaking to you tonight is is been has been part of my personal path to becoming whole upon this earth once again to become in my public life what I have been in my private life and in closing I'd like to leave you with this thought I still have many questions about what it means to integrate experiences such as those that I've been describing tonight I think we are still in the early stages of understanding how entering such extreme states of Consciousness is affecting us in the long term what does it do to a person to hold the kind of memories that I am holding what does integration even mean in this context how does a time-bound person a time-bound being exquisitely tuned to the conditions of space-time absorb excursions into deep time how does a finite being digest our forays into the infinite what is the residual impact of merging with all of existence after we have returned to being just one among many I am asking more questions than I have answers for my life has become a living experiment in these matters with the outcome still being determined but I say again I would not have missed this journey for anything in the world it has been the philosophical and spiritual adventure of a lifetime and I take great joy in sharing it with you tonight thank you thank you very much indeed Chris if you could just stop your screen share that would be good there we go and I met my eyes I'm on uh well uh I don't know how many of you have read Christy's book or his article and and the earlier book which I read 20 years ago you know Dark Knight or early Dawn um but it's it's it's a pretty shattering experience to read let alone go through and one of the things that I felt was that Chris has done something on our undertaken this journey on our behalf so that we can um borrow in inverted commas some of his insights and which I think are hugely important for our own understanding of who we are and where we're going and so I just uh two I'm just going to make two or three observations then we're going to have a break and then come back for for uh sort of questions session um one of the the main questions you can ask about what Chris has been talking about is does um what he is conveying here give us access to the Deep structure of reality or to the Deep deeper structures of reality and this is something that we ask in the Galileo commission report in which Harold argues in the affirmative in other words that they do and this would correspond to the third bar of Jeff who um that was with us a couple of weeks ago now do these experiences have important implications for understanding of Consciousness and Consciousness and reality well my answer would be absolutely but obviously everybody has to you know make their draw their own conclusion and what you'll find what I found is that I I have an extensive um background in near-death and mystical experiences in terms of the literature which many or other people on the call also have and it's consistent with all that but it takes it a bit further in fact a lot off and it's a kind of ultimate gnosis or knowing by identification and then um observation is that we are clearly living in um apocalyptic time um here um at one level or another uh and about the evolutionary prospects and the birth of the future human um has an extraordinary resonance um I think at this time and it's something that Anne bearing was he's on the call tonight who was referring to um last week and and so it'll be very interesting to see how people feel about that we've got a lot of questions that have come up um already and and in the chat box but we'll get some live contributions um and so Chris um wonderful thank you very very much indeed for sharing that so lucidly oh Paul uh from Polo you have a question hello yes I'm uh hi Chris hi thank you a very nice presentation um I I mean you know whenever you use the word universe uh something just sticks in me as an astronomer I know galaxies Dino Stars clusters of galaxies vast physical spaces uh that's what Universe means to me now I have a feeling the universe in a very different way but I doubt but again you know I question whether it doesn't see when again when you see God I don't mean Universe um you know um the universe um it's it's a place where well anyway that's a it's a long subject I think I've asked my question anyway if you could elaborate a little by what you mean by universe so that you're absolutely right Paul you've caught me out on this I struggle with language I struggle with how to describe some of these realities that I've entered um I don't like using the word God I don't use it much but I use it once in a while and I don't like using it because it carries so much baggage from history and and what most people mean by God is not what I mean by God and so I'll use the word divine sometimes but that's just a bit of a a ruse because there it comes back to the same but I'm trying to strip the concept free of the historical accumulation to me I collect pictures of of galaxies I've collect collect pictures of nebulas and when I when I move into meditation practice I I just will play them over and over and over again because this is my god this is my Divine and it it but what I'm referring to or what my experience is is not to the outer body of the Divine though I was taken into exploring some of the body of the universe but if I were a physicist and I would love to have degrees in physics and go into these Estates because they this Consciousness could have shown me so much more if I had degrees in astrophysics and degrees in quantum theory just my mind could was not tuned to that type of knowledge I'm talking about the Consciousness which is the the consciousness of the universe the Consciousness which is given birth to the universe and I'm just scraping the edges of it I'm just touching the pieces of it my experience of it is certainly limited by what I can understand because and again what I would love to do is have a hundred of our best brightest most talented scientist artists social activists going into these states in a systematic fashion I mean can you imagine a protocol if we had a hundred of such people working one day a month for two years what body of knowledge they would come back with and would be able to share it's never the experience of the any individual which is important it's the experience of our Collective of our Collective genius and our Collective Talent as we are engaged so I stretch language that I stretched language it's as big as the universe it's it's deeper than time it's it's more intelligent than any intelligence I can ever been able to touch inside time and space and the compassion which is the emotion of Oneness it's when the quantum physicists talk about you know the implicate order the Oneness that underlies all manifest existence that implicant order has a wholeness that when I touch it it just explodes me with love because love is the emotion of Oneness but I don't mean love in an ordinary sense of love but it's kind of the closest approximation I have so you're right that I I'm using Universe in the borrowed fashion and I'm using it in an extrapolated fashion thank you very much I I think it's I mean what for those of you who read the book you you'll you'll understand that the or the books that for me the way that you you articulate these ineffable experiences into language it gives me the sense that I'm I'm as near vicariously as I can get um to to that um gnosis the understanding from within and and in in the Galileo commission we talk about exploring Inner Space and so in that sense you're you're a psychonaut obviously of a exploration of Inner Space so thank you very much for that question next question is from our president uh Professor Bernard Carr um in London Bernard oh hi there Chris hey good to see you and you too first of all thank you for uh well for taking this this Cosmic journey and then for coming to coming back to tell us all about it it was absolutely engrossing um I noticed at one point you said you rather wish you had a degree in astrophysics and then you will be able to in another way well I I have a degree in astrophysics and I rather wish I had a degree in the psychedelics and then I could but my question really is is a follow-up to Paul tanovitz this question about um the use of the word Universe because they're sort of a a distinction between your constant references to humanity as a species and then your description in in cosmological terms where you know even your images are are from cosmology um and you you said that in some sense that you that was poetic license but on the other hand it does seem to me that if you really are contacting in that greater reality that Cosmic Consciousness you really will be contacting um if you like a cosmic level of Consciousness not just the terrestrial level of Consciousness and if for example one studies the writings of Buddha when Buddha in the vesuti Margo and he had his experiences he was very explicit in the fact that he was experiencing realities beyond the normal terrestrial you know the galactic and the cosmic and things like that so my question was this although you're always referring to humanity humanity is is something which by definition is very much linked with planet Earth did you ever feel that actually what you were encountering was something on a scale much larger than Humanity in other words that it really was Cosmic yes absolutely um and again I wish I had your degrees the universe could have taught me so much more than but when I entered in dark into archetypal reality and I said I died as a human being as of my species identity from that point on in the journey my sessions basically took me outside of the operational range of our Collective psyche outside of Human Experience outside of human history when I began to move beyond the collective psyche everything associated and held within the collective psyche began to Fall Away all our understandings of God all our projections of God all all the the the Flotsam and Judson of History just fell away and I moved into these hyper increasingly clear hyper clearance states of of consciousness harder to describe because so contentless and I don't think I I think we can be very Cavalier about language and I and I apologize if I've contributed to that but I think when we talk about universal mind or Cosmic mind it is a huge huge Concepts and and I would say that the only part of that mind that I know and learned about was the part that it taught me about there was a Consciousness which took me in there was a Consciousness that taught me broke me down caught me grounded me up in the dust and took me deeper and deeper into itself but even so I know I was only experiencing pieces aspects fractal manifestations of its totality so my language Peters out at that deep level in when I moved into Diamond Luminosity I had a very clear perception of moving outside of samsara outside the Bardo into a reality that's truly even outside archetypal reality there was a period when I was born into archetypal reality and then there was a process in which I was born out of archetypal reality into a level of reality which pre-exists before archetypal reality yeah on the non-physical level yeah thank you very much absolutely non-physical yeah I'm just going to take an observation from the chat from Shide um about in your Journeys did you get a sense of why we seem to learn only through pain and suffering the Divine Heritage we come from or must return to why was this path into Mata back back to into Spirit necessary but of course that's sort of 64 000. and it reminds me of this that you would have heard before probably that there are only two reasons we change desperation or inspiration and where we certainly change if we're desperate and and we can preemptively change perhaps if we're inspired I mean for me um this is part of the kind of Gnostic myth that we forget we formed the darkness we try and return to the light and we forget who we are we then have to try and remember who we are we go to sleep we have to wake up it just seems to be how things are constituted is that your view or do you have another angle of it I agree with you and this is my experiences when I would go deeper and deeper and deeper into these levels of reality I always experienced it as a remembering I was remembering I was remembering and I didn't I don't have any sense that in forgetting that that was a tragedy or that was somehow my mistake or some Cosmic sin or some you know original sin it seemed to be part of the natural order of things there is the greater and there is the Lesser when we come into the Lesser we forget but we have to remember everything that we're describing is constantly changing it's constantly evolving so that I don't think I think I I think we have had a tendency to sort of freeze our level of evolutionary maturity and to form judgments around how we got here where we're going and what we're doing and we have to let go of all these sort of fixated fragments because the human being as SRI arbindo said is a transitional being we are moving from what we were to what we are becoming we are changing life is changing planets are changing our species is changing we are in movement and so why things are the way they are isn't on isn't something that we can answer on an absolute scale it's something we can only answer on an evolving a try to answer an evolving scale but that of course requires expanding our time Horizon enormously when a geologist helps us expand our time Horizon helps us understand plate tectonics that's extraordinarily exciting or when a physicist helps us understand the evolution of galaxies it's extraordinarily exciting this is something similar we have to expand beyond our personal Consciousness to ex to have something about the intentionality that's manifesting itself in This ever-evolving Magnificent universe that we are part of and so we we need to tune into that part of ourselves um that and we don't take any more question questions by the way um we need to tune into that part of ourselves um which knows as you said that we're here we're here for the ride now fasten the seat belts or maybe not fasten the seats belts um so um we if we if we're really centered as we go through this process um then we'll get the guidance we need both individually and collectively but we need to listen to that that guidance and we need to enable the new shoots and there's so much creative thinking going on I was in a group this afternoon on the spiritual spirituality and education Alliance and and so there's a huge amount of good going on that we don't hear about except in positive news uh Humanity Rising thank you that's also Humanity rising and all the ubiquity University um and so we we need to keep ourselves buoyed up I think by by the positive things that are going on but also as you say um face down um the negative with with the kind of Courage that you demonstrated in your journey um so I I think I thank you on behalf of us all um for the journey you took and for bringing back these Treasures these gems and that we can actually appreciate and we can appropriate some of these uh for our own journey and understanding um just because you have made that journey and so I really salute you um for that that Odyssey I mean you've translated into it it's only at the hero's journey and and just um uh just a point of information for people I I mentioned Thomas troward a moment ago this is a book here which I would recommend as a good startup from Thomas trout it's called um the wisdom of Thomas troward and it has four of his main sets of lectures in it and if he was a judge in India you can really get to grips with this stuff and and so I I do re and he he talked about self-recognition when the universal became the particular in us then we had to recognize ourselves back again as the universal and so he was actually talking about these things um in his own way no 100 years ago so um we're all trying to uh catch up with the perennial as it were and live through it so everybody on the call thank you so much um for coming and being part of this evening I hope you've been inspired by it I hope that you've learned something that you can apply to your own lives to your own journey and and Andrew thank you very much for all the coordination Jess Jessica cornet thank you for all the help with the publicity uh and Chris thank you so much for sharing that that deep wisdom which we really all need to take on board um in the the Rapids that we are entering at the moment so um I look forward to seeing everybody on a future event and good night everybody and God bless much love and light to you all</p>

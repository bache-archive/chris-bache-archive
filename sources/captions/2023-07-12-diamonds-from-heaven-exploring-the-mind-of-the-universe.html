      <p>eventually I came to understand that the many deaths that one endures in this process are actually that death is actually a symptom of purification the form that you are can die the structures of your life can be shattered but the Inner Essence of your being cannot die and I began to realize that death what we experience as death is actually a deep form of purification which is letting go of the small in order to welcome and be welcomed by that which is larger [Music] Hello friends welcome I'm so happy that you're here with us for insights at the edge live in this episode of insights at the edge my guess is Christopher M BH PhD let me tell you a little bit about Chris he's professor emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years he's also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of integral studies Emeritus fellow at The Institute of noetic Sciences and he's on the advisory Council of Groff Legacy training he's written several books including Dark Knight early Dawn the living classroom and a book that got my attention some friends of mine said I'm reading this book it's called LSD and the mind of the universe you've got to read it it's so engrossing it's a page Turner it will actually introduce you what the mind of the universe what's that and you know if there was ever a moment where I think it's appropriate to say this conversation is a conversation that truly will be filled with insights at the edge it's this conversation with Chris Bates Chris welcome hi Tammy it's a pleasure to be here with you this evening tell us a little bit right here at the beginning what prompted you to engage ready for this over 20 years in 73 high dose LSD sessions that were structured in a specific way for the purpose of deep Spiritual Awakening and exploring the nature of the cosmos what inspired you to engage in such what we'll learn it was really an arduous undertaking well I had just finished graduate school I got my PhD from Brown University in philosophy of religion I had published my dissertation in a series of Articles and was looking for where to take my work next and at that point in my life I met the work of Ian Stevenson and reincarnation research at Virginia and more importantly of Stan Groff and as soon as I read Realms of the human unconscious which had just been published this was in 78 when I started uh I immediately saw the profound implications for Stan's work for philosophy of religion not just for psychology and I knew I wanted to get involved in doing this work um so even though LSD had been made illegal at by that time this is it had been made illegal 1970 I chose to conscientiously break the law and to begin a series of rigorously structured following Stan's protocol of LSD sessions and I chose after three medium dose sessions to work at high doses this is a protocol I don't recommend today I would be much gentler on myself if I were doing it over again but at the time I did this is what I was doing to explore to accelerate my own Spiritual Development and then quickly it evolved into engaging the Deep structures of human evolution and trying to support Humanities Spiritual Development and then exploring this marvelous universe that we are part of you right towards the beginning of the book in the end what's important is not the method of exploration used but what this method shows us about the extraordinary Universe we live in and that's what I want to focus on in our conversation is really the discoveries that you made and why don't we start off with the title of the book LSD and here we go the mind of the universe I'm not sure everyone even can track with you there the universe has a mind tell us what you discovered about this well as I came to experience it I experienced Consciousness as like an infinite ocean and when we open ourselves in deep psychedelic States it's like our mind is a seed Catalyst that we drop into this ocean and it crystallizes a set of experiences out of this infinite potential and by absorbing these experiences and internalizing them and learning what we are being offered who are being being taught uh we're changed we're purified we're we're changed inwardly and then when we drop that changed mind into this infinite potential it triggers an even deeper set of experiences out of out of its Infinity and I always experienced myself as engaging on intelligence a Consciousness that was directing my sessions I mean I never did not control what was unfolding in my sessions I was always yielding and following a lead that came from conscious deeper levels of consciousness and as the journey continued that the levels of consciousness that I was entering deep in several times multiple times and so what do we call this infinite Consciousness that's been called many things in the world's mystical Traditions I hesitate to call it God though I do refer to it as the Divine because God has so many layers of historical historical overlay which I I wouldn't want to affirm so just to give them some sense of the approximation of the vast scale and scope of this Consciousness I call it the mind of the universe now just as the the universe has a body it has a mind and you can't our mind is as our body is a product of our universe our mind is also a product of the universe and when we sink deeply into our Consciousness we come out into a vast Consciousness which you can think of as the Divine Consciousness or you can think of it as the mind of the universe now you use this word purification and I referred to the 73 Journeys that you went on as having a quality of arduousness to at least it read that way to me as you include much of the descriptions of what you went through in each one of these Journeys I mean in the beginning you know what you're writing about is seizures vomiting convulsions it sounded really rough why was that do you think now in retrospect as you look back why was all of that physical and energetic purification necessary well there are many levels of answers to that but basically if we want to move into deeper intimacy with the consciousness of the universe we're moving into States Of Consciousness which are large which are vast and operated a much higher level of a much higher frequency much higher energy level and our egoic Consciousness the Consciousness which surrounds our body in a sense and which is the Consciousness that we are operationalizing as egoic Consciousness is just too small uh we have to let go of that Consciousness and some people find that easier and more difficult but letting go of that Consciousness and and dying as an at the egoic level and entering into spiritual reality I found is actually the first of many cycles of death and rebirth because the universe has many levels in many dimensions to it uh in order to enter each successive deeper level we have to go through a deeper level of surrender and that often involves very intense uh purification confrontations and every step deeper into the universe is a step into a higher bandwidth of energy if you will we have to literally learn to become a being who can live can live at that level become operational that level for hours and hours at a time and that takes that takes work it's it's it takes a lot of work you you write in the context of a psychedelic session pain is something we learn to embrace one learns to reverse one's instinct to avoid suffering and to open to it instead not because we like to suffer but because of what lies on the other side of suffering yes and I wanted to understand more about what you learned about embracing pain and I asked this question Chris because in the midst of Our Lives there's so much pain we need to embrace and so much letting go that we have to do and I I don't think that many of us are that good at it hmm well I want to be careful I don't want to over generalize the the insights or truths that emerge in a psychedelic session and apply them to certain circumstances in our everyday life so we'll we'd have to make some necessary adjustments to it but in a psychedelic session when we hyper amplify Consciousness Consciousness begins to clean itself it begins to transform itself and as it purifies itself and as it goes through these first we encounter unfinished business you know things would rather not face things we're scared of things that frighten us but that's only early layers eventually we're going through layers in which we're sloughing off not only our personal identity but we're sloughing off our identity as a human being per se and then our identity as a time space being as we're moving beyond a linear time and Beyond three-dimensional space um all of these adjustments to move into these deeper states of consciousness involve uh again when you're working with high doses of a psychedelic like LSD it it it intensifies and accelerates this purification process if you took an ice cube and put it next to a candle meaning analogy for a gentler spiritual practice the candle would melt the ice cube very gently and it would weep and it would dissolve but if you threw the same Ice Cube on a hot Skillet it would bump around jump around and snap crackle and pop as the molecules exploded and psychedelic sessions are kind of like the latter you're doing the same process that you do in deep Long contemplative Retreat context but you're doing it faster and because you're doing it faster there's more of a kind of a convulsive quality to it there's more intense quality to it but essentially it is the same as traditional spiritual practitioners undergoing The Dark Knight of the soul in these processes it's the same process eventually I came to understand that the many deaths that one endures in this process are actually that death is actually a symptom of purification once you've died several times and been reborn on the other side of that process you realize you can't die it's impossible to Die the form that you are can die the structures of your life can be shattered but the Inner Essence of your being cannot die so that death itself begins to lose its category it becomes to be a non-functional category and I began to realize that death what we experience as death is actually a deep form of purification which is letting go of the small in order to welcome and be welcomed by that which is larger which brings me to wanting to make sure that we carefully parse out but I still want to address here in the midst of Our Lives not in the midst of psychedelic sessions what did you learn about what it takes to die before we die that's really what I want to understand yeah foreign I want to be careful because I would I don't want to frame my work in terms of the Dynamics of Spiritual Awakening and that phrasing to die before we die so that we do not die when we die is kind of really oriented around the Dynamics of Spiritual Awakening in my sense in my work even though I began this work with the thought of an Awakening A Spiritual Awakening agenda it became much more than that it became an adventure of exploring the Deep structure of the universe itself and so um death changes as one goes as one pivots from Spiritual Awakening as a project to cosmological exploration as a project but what I learned uh if I were to try to summarize it in some way uh first I have no fear of death whatsoever I have no fear of dying I feel like I've died many times in that process and in that process of dying before you die physically there is a great relaxation that settles in on the an abiding communion with the universe or with the Divine which begins to saturate one's physical existence so that um the boundary line between here and there between being physically alive and spiritually alive and cosmologically Alive it gets very thin in the process so I guess I've learned to trust life more to recognize that anything that's coming at me which is challenging and difficult is to be embraced head on straightforward to not back away from anything to see everything to its root and that's a major lesson in psychedelic work if you run from the hard stuff it only gets worse but if you embrace the challenges and let the universe take you where it wants to take you then eventually you will come to a Breaking Point and when you go through that eye of that needle you will open up into a magnificent landscape a different level of being [Music]</p>

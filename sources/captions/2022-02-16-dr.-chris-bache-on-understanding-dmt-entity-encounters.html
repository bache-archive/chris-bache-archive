      <p>a guy I was speaking to at integration Circle he mentioned he had a mystical experience where he encountered none other than Ganesh the elephant God of Hinduism after your Journeys how would you reflect on sort of the meaning of encountering say a particular form of a deity or something like that when we experience realities that are Beyond us or Consciousness dimensions of Consciousness that are beyond our own and when we're tapping into those qualities that are like infinite compassion and infinite intelligence uh and infinite creativity these are qualities that we tend to associate historically with various deities and it's not surprising that our mind would put together the qualities of the phenomenology of the experience with the qualities of the deities which we may or may may have had experience exposure to intellectually and sometimes we counter deities that we haven't they're not part of our own personal lineage and may not have been part of our um they may not have been something even that we knew about it comes completely out of left field and yet it Bears the form of a culture's form of this deity like Ganesh or Jesus or Mary or the prophet Muhammad or something like that so my understanding of it is that when you are working or when you are engaging entities are forms that have this quality of an entity that is identifiable in our historical Traditions my sense is that we are engaging a collective thought form or a spiritual being that is wearing the clothes of a collective thought form and by a collective thought form I mean if you have millions and millions of devotees that meditate and pray and offer devotions to a particular deity form which has been identified in their scripture which is painted in their culture statuary is all of this form if you have millions and millions and millions of being over thousands of years in devotional attachment to these forms or devotional focus on these forms I think it creates a certain structure in the collective psyche a collective thought form and I don't minimize those forms I think they're extraordinarily powerful including secular thought Farms like greed power anger those you know very powerful in our system so when we encounter the deity in a or a deity in a in a particular form we are either encountering a spiritual principle which is beyond form which is wearing the form of this Collective garment or we're experiencing the collective garments straight out in itself either way the collective psyche is implicated the collective psyche is part of our experience which is all perfectly normal and perfectly well and good I think um at the same time I would hold out that it is possible to go beyond all Collective thought forms and to go beyond human history in one's experience and when one does those forms tend to fade away I know there's a lot of discussion of entities because particularly DMT and DMT derivatives often expose people to entities and I'm not suggesting that those entities aren't real or the entities don't exist but to me personally uh and again limitations but personally those entities reflect different levels of reality that as you go deeper those levels that that kind of granular quality of lots of individual beings tends to yield to levels of reality which are less granular fewer individual beings kind of constituting the population of those levels of reality and opening up into vast Tracks Of Consciousness which are less individual less entity-like it at least it is in my experience yeah that that definitely seems to resonate um in terms of it being sort of a matter of levels um and uh after seeing sort of where you go in those levels it makes a lot more sense that at some point even though it's dissolve and becomes something different</p>

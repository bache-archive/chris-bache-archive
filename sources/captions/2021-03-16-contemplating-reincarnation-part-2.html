<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset='utf-8'><link rel='stylesheet' href='/chris-bache-archive/assets/style.css'></head><body><p>Well, hello, Richard.</p>
<p>It's good to continue our discussion. You know, in our previous discussion, we sort of started</p>
<p>the discussion of reincarnation. We looked at the evidence for reincarnation, these extraordinary</p>
<p>children from around the world. We began to unpack that evidence into a</p>
<p>deeper understanding of the rhythms of life and the stages of human evolution</p>
<p>that reincarnation makes possible. The restoration of the theme of the meaningfulness</p>
<p>of the challenges that we find embedded in our life,</p>
<p>and the opportunity to actually deepen our therapeutic interventions</p>
<p>in the places where we are stuck, the places where we're holding pain,</p>
<p>that are rooted in our deeper history. So now, today, we take it farther. We begin to look deeper</p>
<p>into the significance of what are we? What's the significance of the fact</p>
<p>that we are reincarnating beings, in the universe that obviously</p>
<p>supports and nurtures, and created this reincarnation dynamic? That's a huge difference.</p>
<p>Isn't it? Like, to be living in a universe that is nurturing us, you know, that has a kind</p>
<p>of paternal/maternal energy, you know, surrounding it. That has such a different framework to be born into? Yeah.</p>
<p>And, you know, I want to mention at the outset,</p>
<p>that sometimes reincarnation thinkers go in a direction of thinking that - every</p>
<p>little bitty thing in our life has a determined quality,</p>
<p>a deterministic quality. But I don't think we necessarily need to go there, because chance is one of the</p>
<p>powerful elements of this universe. And so we can affirm meaning, and we can affirm intentionality</p>
<p>without putting every detail of our life into that press,</p>
<p>and ask, 'Well, what's the meaning of this and what's the meaning of that?'</p>
<p>to affirm a larger scope of meaning. Still, in a world where there are chance, and there are variables</p>
<p>and there are uncertainties. What's important, I think, is understanding that the universe</p>
<p>pays attention to how we respond to chance events, as well as intentional</p>
<p>events, that our learning and the quality of our response is carried forward</p>
<p>and does us credit, regardless of the origin</p>
<p>of the challenges that we're facing. Yeah, absolutely. I just, funnily enough, today,</p>
<p>recorded a short meditation. And in it I asked people to kind</p>
<p>of imagine the universe, with its-- with-- criss-crossed</p>
<p>by its fields of Karma, you know, almost these ley</p>
<p>lines through time and space, that kind of have this karmic energy, they're rippling. And the whole of the</p>
<p>cosmos is rippling with these fields. And then I asked each person-- well I asked</p>
<p>whoever's meditating, to send out one really beautiful thought. Like, just from the depth of their soul,</p>
<p>send out a really beautiful thought into that, and see the universe</p>
<p>respond to that and see how it enters the field. And how the universe</p>
<p>maybe kind of sighs and expands. And how it reaches every single tiny area,</p>
<p>almost like it opens up synapses in some way. And just the power of-- the incalculable power</p>
<p>of something like that, you know, dropped into the ocean of time space. You know, I found that,</p>
<p>like, a really powerful contemplation to do.</p>
<p>Yeah. Absolutely, I agree. That's been very much my experience</p>
<p>and my own work with psychedelics. There was nothing that I did, working at deep levels,</p>
<p>that was mine alone, that was private. And that the pain came from a larger collective web, and the healing spread</p>
<p>out into a larger collective web. And that really those exercises, the meditations that you're describing,</p>
<p>I think really are important for changing the thought of a tilt in how we</p>
<p>live in the universe, because according to just our physical senses we have this feeling often</p>
<p>that life happens to us. Life is something independent of us and then it just happens to us, and</p>
<p>then we're victims of it and we respond. But when you begin to</p>
<p>send out energy into the universe, when you begin to send out healing</p>
<p>and love into the universe, and you watch the universe respond</p>
<p>in immediate and then indirect ways, then you begin to shift into a-- the sense</p>
<p>that you are living in a dynamic field. You are part of a dynamic field,</p>
<p>living in a field. And at the very deep level, on the subtle level,</p>
<p>you are creating your universe as you go. Once you begin to understand that, still, it doesn't mean you're free of all the karma that's coming</p>
<p>at you from the past. It's still working its</p>
<p>way through the system. But, increasingly,</p>
<p>the balance of your life tilts from being kind of the passive recipient</p>
<p>of things that you personally didn't start, to being the generator</p>
<p>of the life that you are inheriting now. Yeah.</p>
<p>You're no longer a victim. You're a creator, yeah? Participator.</p>
<p>Creator, yes. We got this great question that thought that we'd kind of inject into this talk, which is</p>
<ul>
<li>what happens to us when we die? So shall we-- let's explore</li>
</ul>
<p>that, I mean you know that other-- many other cultures--</p>
<p>I think we wanted to mention the Tibetans because they seem to really have a handle</p>
<p>on some of these things. Egyptians as well, but,</p>
<p>you know, Tibetans, perhaps are a little bit more contemporary</p>
<p>because they're still here. They're still practising very much those teachings, the Bardo teachings. And psychotherapists are now</p>
<p>exploring this territory. Joel Whitton's first book 'Life</p>
<p>Between Life' explored this. And Michael Newton's work,</p>
<p>and his books 'Journey of Souls' and 'Destiny of Souls' are very</p>
<p>systematic attempts to explore through deep states of regression,</p>
<p>of spiritual regression, what happens to people when they</p>
<p>go through the death process. So, really, we've got two halves of life. We've got birth to death, and then we've got birth-- death to birth. And we've been missing this side. But really you have to understand the whole circle</p>
<p>to really understand what happens. So, yeah, let's jump into it.</p>
<p>Yeah. So obviously you know the Tibetans</p>
<p>have coined this phrase 'The Bardo', which is this in between state. But it can also be used to describe a transformational</p>
<p>experience, you know because that's-- life is filled</p>
<p>with transformational experiences. But particularly when you're moving through a threshold, across a threshold,</p>
<p>you know, like death or birth are classic thresholds,</p>
<p>and they sit there as kind of almost an allegory of all transformation,</p>
<p>don't they? Death and birth. Because we have so many deaths and births,</p>
<p>even within one lifetime. So it seems like a kind of obvious logic to expand that</p>
<p>allegory out beyond individual births, and see it everywhere</p>
<p>throughout the entire Cosmos. And I know you've experienced this very</p>
<p>profoundly in your psychedelic journeys. Like this constant-- you've described, like, those constant states of transformation that-- or</p>
<p>you've been through them. In those-- do you know what I'm pointing to, this constant rebirth? Yeah. Yes, I mean when I started the work,</p>
<p>I thought there was just one death-- ego death, that would then launch</p>
<p>you into the spiritual universe. But what I found is, of course, the spiritual universe has many,</p>
<p>many layers to it. And just because you're operational at certain layers doesn't mean you're</p>
<p>operational yet at deeper layers. And you actually have to go through</p>
<p>another metamorphosis of death and surrender to be reborn into that</p>
<p>'nother layer, and so on, and so forth. And that reflects</p>
<p>the Tibetan idea of Bardo. Bardo really means a discrete</p>
<p>layer of consciousness. And so when they're describing the after-death journey, there are</p>
<p>multiple Bardos that manifest themselves. Now we in the West have tended to use the term Bardo to expand on that,</p>
<p>and basically let the Bardo represent the sum total of all things that happen</p>
<p>to us when we die, on the other side. And that's a perfectly acceptable, you know, use of the term. But their use of it is in terms</p>
<p>of stages of that progression. So there's one Bardo,</p>
<p>you pass through another Bardo, you pass through--</p>
<p>there's the Bardo of the Hungry Ghost, to the Bardo of the Heavenly Spirits,</p>
<p>and things like this. But the basic pattern I</p>
<p>think that they identified, is the same pattern that the</p>
<p>psychotherapists are identifying too. That when we die,</p>
<p>we go through a period of reunion with our soul, with our-- and our soul lineage. And the first thing that takes place is that we debrief</p>
<p>from our most recent life. We basically process the life that we just lived, in</p>
<p>the context of absolute love and a love so deep it's not</p>
<p>even a matter of forgiveness. But we experience</p>
<p>the totality of our life, all of our shortcomings, all of our good</p>
<p>deeds, in the context of infinite love. And we have the opportunity to look at our life and see what we did</p>
<p>well and see what we didn't do well. And we have the whole notion, don't we, of like, the 'life flashing before you</p>
<p>as you die', like, this kind of replay in the timeless dimension. You know, because there's-- so it makes perfect sense, like, for us to go through that</p>
<p>deep reflection at the end of something. And it's what we do in life, right? Yeah. I think that with the near-death</p>
<p>experience of a life-review, is a snapshot of what happens,</p>
<p>kind of, in a full death experience of a-- just a detailed reliving</p>
<p>of every detail, every nuance. Far more details than we can keep</p>
<p>track of inside time and space. And we see how our life rippled</p>
<p>out and touched other people. We experience how our evil deeds hurt</p>
<p>and how our good deeds helped. And so we experience the totality</p>
<p>of our life in the seamless fabric. And we experience them</p>
<p>without a physical body. So we experience them in a subtle</p>
<p>body which is much more intense. You know like the Astral Body, or as it's so called, or the Mental Body,</p>
<p>these subtle layers, the Causal Body, you know. Without the physicality, the intensity of those emotions that we</p>
<p>probably feel, or we review, have given rise to this notion of, like, eternal damnation from,</p>
<p>you know, the Christians, for example. Or even, like, the eternal bliss</p>
<p>realms of the Buddhas-- the Buddhists. Or heaven and hell and, you know-- because there's this sense of eternity. I think it's a correct intuition, because when there's no-- when you're out of time and space, in that sense,</p>
<p>you're in that place of grace, then an experience of, you know, the harm you've caused or the hurt you've caused</p>
<p>could feel like it-- you know, in that moment, in that timeless</p>
<p>space, could feel like it's infinite. You know, 'I've caused, like, an intense</p>
<p>pain,' and then seeing the ripple of that pain into a life, and</p>
<p>how it carries on through that being, and then finally gets worked out. I mean I don't know how-- what level we</p>
<p>experience that, but I imagine we experience</p>
<p>a lot of the subtler dimensions of our karmic,</p>
<p>you know, the repercussions of our karma. They're pretty-- very intense! Yeah. But then what locks in this</p>
<p>experience, this phenomenology of eternity,</p>
<p>what locks it in as a metaphysical principle is the mistaken view</p>
<p>that we only live once. So we've had our chance, and there's</p>
<p>absolutely no chance to correct it. So if you're going to be accountable,</p>
<p>and if you're going to, you know, be accountable to good, and you've screwed up, then you're</p>
<p>punished forever, and ever, and ever. And of course, fortunately, no one finds that when they actually</p>
<p>get into the deep-- the depth of it. The past-life therapists don't find that, the Buddhists don't</p>
<p>find that. That we do-- we are accountable, we are responsible, we do experience the pain we cause</p>
<p>others, but that's so that we can learn, and that's so that we can come back and do better next time,</p>
<p>and better next time, and grow, and grow. Yeah, I mean, I'm from a lineage of</p>
<p>distillers in my family. And so I like the-- you know, I look at it-- this</p>
<p>is my intuitive reading of perhaps</p>
<p>you know a colourful way of maybe how this happens, is that</p>
<p>there's a distilling process, and in that-- or</p>
<p>a fermentation of some form. So that the grosser matter starts</p>
<p>to fall down back to Earth in a way. Like this is the notion of having these subtle bodies, where the lower</p>
<p>bodies, the Astral, you know, those lower energies that we've created, fall back into the lower plains, and then</p>
<p>something higher gets crystallised. The distillation of our life. All that was good about it, all that we've learned is being distilled</p>
<p>into this purer, kind of quintessence, that then stays and adds to our soul's trajectory. But then the lower-- all that kind of elemental energy that sinks back into those</p>
<p>lower planes of being, they also carry our Karma, those droplets, if you like, of karma, sink back down and they-- you know, we</p>
<p>still have to redress them. Although they-- my understanding is that they move into the</p>
<p>collective field as well. So, every act or every word we speak, let's say, or every thought we have,</p>
<p>goes into the collective. So that, you know, we are all co-creating the karma of humanity,</p>
<p>the collective karma of humanity. And then we have to return to pick up where we left-off. But we have this enhanced soul, you know, this-- that</p>
<p>we've learned from. So when we return,</p>
<p>there's more awareness present. So there is this continuity, you know, and the other way I see it is that there's-- you know, our</p>
<p>lives are trajectories. They're like arcs. I say there's an arc.</p>
<p>It's like an arc. It's curving.</p>
<p>It's always moving. If you looked at it, it might be a spiral, or it might have one of these</p>
<p>Kundalini shapes underneath it. It's not a straight line. And that is what we-- that's what never ends, that arc. We follow that arc and it goes</p>
<p>through the portal and it continues. And that's the lineage. If you're able to trace that arc</p>
<p>in your inner being, then you can trace your lineage, where</p>
<p>you've come from and where you're going. And your memory can travel down that arc,</p>
<p>your awareness can travel down that arc, which enables you to remember, or</p>
<p>to predict, in the case of Tibetans, to predict where you'll return, because the awareness is aware of</p>
<p>the arc, not just in its own life. Because if you look at an arc,</p>
<p>within one life, it may do that. But then if you can see it-- if you</p>
<p>can project it beyond this life, you can then-- you know your</p>
<p>awareness can predict intuitively where you're coming back, can even maybe even further than predict? Maybe it can even create, you know, where you are going</p>
<p>to return, in some respect. So anyway that's-- those are ideas, yeah. You know I've never been very interested</p>
<p>in tracing my genealogy, but I have been interested</p>
<p>in tracing the genealogy of my soul, which is what you're describing. Just reaching back and basically what you</p>
<p>might think of as deep remembering. Remembering who you are,</p>
<p>who you have been. And when you do that, you do have a certain sense of trajectory,</p>
<p>of kind of developmental process. And your pointing to the collective,</p>
<p>I think, is absolutely right. What we're learning is the individual</p>
<p>and the collective are evolving together. They are functionally separate systems,</p>
<p>but they are deeply intertwined. So everything we are</p>
<p>doing as an individual seeds the growth of the collective, and everything the collective is doing</p>
<p>seeds the growth of the individual. So that when I leave,</p>
<p>I really do believe that when I leave space-time, when I die, and even if I were</p>
<p>to leave the entire system altogether, all of my experiences, all of your</p>
<p>experiences will be held in perfect-- I won't say duplication,</p>
<p>because we are human beings and everything we experience,</p>
<p>the human species gets to hold onto, and therefore our life experience</p>
<p>becomes part of its life experience. Our love and understanding becomes</p>
<p>part of its love and understanding. And it is part of its generative matrix, out of which it gives birth to the next</p>
<p>generation of human beings. So it's a 'both hands' situation here. It's beautiful,</p>
<p>the notion of the Akashic field, that just-- that is constantly</p>
<p>remembering and growing. I love that idea. And, you know, another idea I really like is the notion that comes from the Tibetan</p>
<p>s as well, this notion they call Terma, which-- my interpretation of it is</p>
<p>a word I might use as transmission. It means treasure. And Terma are like teachings in a way, or wisdom teachings, that are waiting for specific teachers in time and space. And the story through the Tibetans is that a lot of the</p>
<p>Terma would-- their lineage Terma were dropped by their great teacher</p>
<p>Padmasambhāva, who is the second Buddha, and he kind of emanated these</p>
<p>Termas into the future. And, like, dropping them like-- kind</p>
<p>of a bit like depth charges, you know? At different levels of depths of time. And that they would</p>
<p>go off at certain points where further emanations,</p>
<p>or disciples of his, or teachers, or really they're kind of aspects of his</p>
<p>greater consciousness, or that being, that lineage, you could say, is better to say. And then they would pick</p>
<p>up and they would go off and be discovered at certain times,</p>
<p>in certain places and periods. And this was a great -- a big-- it was a big shift</p>
<p>in my understanding when I really understood about these Terma, because</p>
<p>that's sort of what happened to me. I had this kind of opening up that was</p>
<p>just hanging there in time and space. And then this wisdom memory came rushing through me, and then</p>
<p>I had to spend the rest of my life, and I still am, figuring out what I'd</p>
<p>received, and living according to it. And I think that's -- I mentioned it not just because it's</p>
<p>part of my story, but because it's a lovely little sort of idea of</p>
<p>how subtle and rich are the layers that survive time and space. That kind of, you know-- and it brings</p>
<p>us perhaps to that notion of involution that we've been thinking about, which-- maybe we could dive into</p>
<p>that a bit? What is involution, Chris? Tell us.</p>
<p>Well, first of all. I want to stop for a moment,</p>
<p>and then first to celebrate your receiving of the</p>
<p>Terma of the Gene Keys. You didn't make those,</p>
<p>you received those and you unpacked them. You take your responsibility</p>
<p>for your half, but you only have half. The other half is like the seed</p>
<p>that comes from above. And once you understand that reincarnation is a cycle that has a bottom half,</p>
<p>an incarnational half and a top half. And just as there are a community</p>
<p>of beings in the bottom half of the cycle, there's also a community</p>
<p>of beings in the top half. That there's layers, and layers,</p>
<p>and layers of spiritual beings. It's not just reincarnating human beings, but there's angelic presences,</p>
<p>and enlightened beings' presences, and all sorts of beings who are here to help</p>
<p>us gestate in our gestational cycle. And so just as there are human beings above to help us, there are the teachings above</p>
<p>to help and infuse our teachings, so that there are these gems</p>
<p>of ideas. Gems of empowerment that-- And so once we have the understanding that a human being</p>
<p>who becomes aware of the dynamics of reincarnation, aware of the deep</p>
<p>evolutionary trajectory of the soul and soul communities,</p>
<p>the way the Tibetans have, then they naturally begin to track</p>
<p>their great beings through time. And they track the great</p>
<p>teachings through time. And they become sensitive to these</p>
<p>diamonds dropping into our minds at specific-- and the deep</p>
<p>significant patterns to this process. So, for me, in addition to the detail of these ideas of-- that there are</p>
<p>Termas, teachings, and that there are Tulkus, you know, self-consciously reincarnating beings. The deeper fabric is</p>
<p>to understand-- begin to understand the depth and the grandeur</p>
<p>at which reincarnation is operating. It's not simply a matter of who we</p>
<p>were in the 17th century. It's really a matter of-- it changes</p>
<p>the parameters of our dialogue with the universe, and therefore it changes our sense of what we are</p>
<p>. Because we are a being that travels through time. We are a being that has absorbed, and been in the spiritual world many times,</p>
<p>and we are incarnating more and more of these diamond teachings into our body,</p>
<p>into our heart, into our mind. And that opens up the playing field of human experience. I think it just opens up. And I teach at a university, where the religion of secular enlightenment is that</p>
<p>the universe appeared by chance. It's been driven by random mutation. There's no meaning to your life. It's all accidental. And when you die, you're dead, that's it. When your brain stops, you're dead. And that just completely-- it's just is such a crushing philosophy. But this, which starts on an empirical basis</p>
<p>but then expands through a deeper appreciation of the dynamics of spiritual</p>
<p>traditions, it restores meaning back to our lives. It allows us to play</p>
<p>in a meaningful landscape of engaging the wisdom of our life</p>
<p>with the wisdom of the universe, entering.</p>
<p>And the involution is that downward flow of meaning, and purpose, and beauty,</p>
<p>and truth, into our life. And then evolution</p>
<p>is our taking it and seeding it and growing it as best we can</p>
<p>into the circumstances of our life. I sometimes look at involution as</p>
<p>the future burrowing into the past, and evolution as the past spiralling towards the future. So you've got these two forces. But you might also look at it as like Aurobindo, you know, who I know you also love,</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo, amazing kind of mind, and how he describes involution as seeds kind of sown deep within matter. So, within matter,</p>
<p>the spirit is there asleep. Like, take a rock, like a piece of lump</p>
<p>of granite, or a volcano, or a mountain. You know, inside that mountain</p>
<p>is a sleeping kind of consciousness of such beauty. But it's just waiting, it's waiting for its time. You know,</p>
<p>and everything, like, a plant has it. And you can see a little bit more of it in a plant, and in a bird you can see it</p>
<p>more clearly, like it's taking animation. And then a mammal, it's, like, even more because it looks at you</p>
<p>in the eyes and it has-- even some of them have that emotional flavour that humans</p>
<p>have, like dogs and horses. And then in a human, it's much more,</p>
<p>like, obvious because you know, we can do this! So the spirit is-- you know, there's</p>
<p>that notion that it's in, like, the gems that you speak of. Like, everything is a gem in matter. Every tiny atom contains</p>
<p>a seed of a spiritual truth, and everything is waiting its time. Everything is on this evolutionary ladder and where evolution meets involution</p>
<p>is kind of the eternal now. Just constantly-- as you said, constantly creating</p>
<p>and just recreating itself. And also from the notion</p>
<p>of involution and evolution you can solve, at some way, I don't know if that's</p>
<p>the right word, but you can penetrate the old chestnut of free</p>
<p>will and determinism. Because if you look at it</p>
<p>from the involution perspective, you might say,</p>
<p>'Well, it's all predetermined because it's all just sitting there waiting for its</p>
<p>moment to come alive.' But from the view of evolution, nothing is predetermined,</p>
<p>everything is being created from this view. So the two of them together,</p>
<p>like a funnel meeting are like this-- that's the paradox for me, of-- you know, that's divine science</p>
<p>that Aurobindo, by the way, just you know really nailed. I mean, if you're able to read</p>
<p>him, which not everyone is! It's a challenge! Like, the layers of subtle nuance</p>
<p>in that man's mind-stream, in terms of how he penetrated this</p>
<p>information, is extraordinary. I know he's inspired both of us. Yes, he has. And I think you're right. I think in some ways it's our everyday experience that there are aspects of our life</p>
<p>which are highly conditioned. And it's our everyday experience that we are not completely</p>
<p>subservient to those conditions. We have a cubic centimetre of free will, which we can expand into a</p>
<p>cubic metre of free will. We choose how we choose to meet</p>
<p>the circumstances of our life. Whether we incubate choice, incubate a space</p>
<p>where we look at the options and really examine deeply what we want to do, what we want to be,</p>
<p>and enact out of that choice. And that's something we can expand on. I mean,</p>
<p>that's how I sort of see what you're doing in Gene Keys, and correct me if I'm wrong,</p>
<p>you're helping people make more informed choices, by giving them</p>
<p>an opportunity to sit deeply with the core, the karmic core,</p>
<p>the swirl of their being. So they make choices on how to engage and</p>
<p>define the outcome of that score. Exactly.</p>
<p>Because in Gene Keys, it's very simple, actually, because you have these</p>
<p>three layers, you know: the Shadow, Gift and Siddhi, and Siddhi is the involving seed. The way I describe it, often,</p>
<p>actually, is the Shadow is the seed. The Gift is in the centre, is the fruit</p>
<p>-- is the flower, and then the Siddhi is the fruit,</p>
<p>and the fruit also contains the seed. There's this whole process of awakening</p>
<p>inside us, where the Shadow suddenly-- you know, our-- what we learn from our karma, what we learn from our mistakes,</p>
<p>what we learn from our challenges, becomes this incredible treasure. And as we unlock it and forgive ourselves,</p>
<p>and learn and evolve, then, you know, we begin to kind of access</p>
<p>those heightened states of consciousness. They're actually buried in those very dense places in creation. And that's our role as humans,</p>
<p>to kind of find those dense places and be an intermediary</p>
<p>to help unlock them. So that's an incredible responsibility. Yeah. My sense is over the course of long time, the shadow seeds become less. They get evaporated in the process of reflective awareness. And so the creative seeds become more,</p>
<p>and the opportunity to become increasingly transparent to the</p>
<p>intelligence of the universe increase. And if we extrapolate that, if that's true,</p>
<p>not only for us individually but collectively,</p>
<p>and clearly the human race has a long way to go before it makes</p>
<p>all of its shadow seeds, because it seems like we have so many</p>
<p>shadow seeds that are driving us now. But if we just step back and give</p>
<p>the benefit of the doubt, and assume that what happens</p>
<p>for the individual, which we've seen, can happen for the collective.</p>
<p>And that humanity as a whole is in the process, through these magnificent, deep collective dynamics, of</p>
<p>cooking its past seeds and transcending its-- the limitations of its past, and moving forward in time.</p>
<p>Then we have reasons to hope that-- what the greatness</p>
<p>of beings, that we see in Tulkus, into intimate dialogue with Termas,</p>
<p>is something that all of humanity is aspiring to, and all</p>
<p>of humanity can become. That we can become -- we are in the process</p>
<p>of becoming a truly-- a species of enlightened beings,</p>
<p>a species where we live in the light, more than living in the shadows. I think we're coming out of the shadows of history into a deeper, deeper,</p>
<p>better tomorrow. Particularly as we start to understand</p>
<p>the universe a little bit more, or the parameters of the universe,</p>
<p>and we look out. You know, I know you've got some wonderful</p>
<p>slides you want to share, which I think would be a great</p>
<p>backdrop if you want to share them. When I think about the topics</p>
<p>that we're talking about today, like - where is reincarnation taking us? What is the larger scope</p>
<p>and purpose of rebirth? I just collect these pictures from the NASA, they send them around</p>
<p>every day, and I collect them, and I meditate on these pictures. I try to envision the enormous distances involved and the millions and billions</p>
<p>of stars that are involved. And the life that's burgeoning on so many of these planets,</p>
<p>in so many of these systems. So that the sheer fertility, the profligate fertility</p>
<p>of the universe, and the scale that the universe is thinking of</p>
<p>in order to create and to manifest orders, and orders, and orders</p>
<p>of evolving life on this magnitude. And then to appreciate that we are part of this. This has been the great, great burden of a one-time-through</p>
<p>metaphysics, the belief that we-- this genius and beauty that we're</p>
<p>seeing in these pictures, if our life is meaningless, and if it's all random chance, we don't</p>
<p>get to participate in this greatness. But if reincarnation is true, and if we are really not limited</p>
<p>by the time that this little body lives, and if our mind is going to grow</p>
<p>for countless, countless, countless incarnations, then we become intimately part of the generative creativity that we see</p>
<p>around us in these vast, magnificent images of the universe. And this then becomes our</p>
<p>playground, you know, without the physical body,</p>
<p>this is surely where we live. This is our playground. And it could be even within</p>
<p>the physical body, you know, at some deep level, as a hologram, you know. That could be a deep truth</p>
<p>that we come to, you know, the 'as above, so below' truth. And I know you've experienced some of that yourself in your experience, your,</p>
<p>you know, journeys. And so have I. It's a fundamental truth I hold</p>
<p>at the core of my being, you know, and in my teachings, also. Like I-- we have this profile</p>
<p>called a Hologenetic profile. And I name it that because it is a map of the inner</p>
<p>workings of our being. But it kind of has a fractal reality that corresponds way beyond this micro-organism here, of one body. It</p>
<p>is replicated throughout the cosmos. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah a lot of the great super-alchemical teachings of the Taoists,</p>
<p>for example, have explored this in their deep, you know, studies</p>
<p>of-- and meditations. Where you go within and you find the galaxies and the stars,</p>
<p>and where they exist in the glands of the body and how</p>
<p>everything has a correspondence. And therefore,</p>
<p>knowing those correspondences allows your awareness to travel into that</p>
<p>reality and outside your physical body. That's, you know, as many people have, well, experienced that in dreams, or in astral projection, or deep</p>
<p>meditation, or psychedelic journeying. I mean, feel free to share some</p>
<p>of your experiences in that. Well, I've done that as carefully as I can in my</p>
<p>book 'LSD and the Mind of the Universe'. But I think the invitation is to appreciate -- I mean, look, we only became conscious of the mother universe about</p>
<p>5000 years ago. We began to have sufficient discipline</p>
<p>to drop beneath the conditioning of our individual egoic mind,</p>
<p>and to tap into that stream of consciousness that we</p>
<p>share with all life. We've been walking upright</p>
<p>for 5.8 million years, we've only-- we've been operating</p>
<p>with our larger brain about 200,000 years. Writing came in about 5000 years ago. The Upanishadic breakthroughs</p>
<p>came in about 3000-4000 years ago. But these are nothing compared to the billions and billions</p>
<p>of years that lie ahead of us. We're just waking up. We're just waking up to who we are. And so, naturally, we kind of get confused given the enormity</p>
<p>of what we're going into. But I think the meditation exercises</p>
<p>that you're describing in those philosophical and spiritual traditions,</p>
<p>which have begun to recognise the correspondence between</p>
<p>the above and the below, naturally, we begin to enter into</p>
<p>exercises where we intentionally, sort of, reinforce the hybrid nature of our life. That we are a spiritual being,</p>
<p>and we are a physical being. We are both pure light,</p>
<p>and we are pure green. And there are correspondences</p>
<p>in our body which correspond to the realities out there. And the more we can internalise</p>
<p>and reinforce them and strengthen them in our meditational exercises,</p>
<p>then we become a more conscious mixing pot.</p>
<p>A more conscious kind of mortar and pestle,</p>
<p>integrating the above and the below. And if we keep this up for a few</p>
<p>tens of thousands of years, and a few millions of years, I mean I-- sometimes I tell my students the only</p>
<p>serious question we should be asking ourselves is - what do you</p>
<p>want to be in a million years? Because you're going to be here</p>
<p>in a million years. So let's get down to it. What is our deepest heart's desire? What can we do? The fundamental question. I heard, a couple of weeks ago, I heard a really interesting talk</p>
<p>by Roger Penrose, you know him? Really imaginative,</p>
<p>top-level physicist in the world today. And he was saying how-- because there's this notion that the universe,</p>
<p>as it's expanding in physics, it's getting further,</p>
<p>and further apart and slowing down. It's going to reach steady-state. And then we're all going to end up in this</p>
<p>kind of slightly distant, dead, lonely kind of stopping point. And that wasn't his-- that's</p>
<p>not his intuition. Or, at least, the way he describes it, is that when</p>
<p>you reach that stopping point, it's the same as if you've gone incredibly fast. As if everything's</p>
<p>come together again, because one end of the spectrum</p>
<p>meets the other end of the spectrum. So you wouldn't be able to tell</p>
<p>if things are slowing down. It actually might be that they look</p>
<p>like they're speeding up. And, anyway, so this is my paraphrasing</p>
<p>what he said. But the thing that really blew me away,</p>
<p>from a physicist to say, was that he said the way he would understand</p>
<p>it is that the logic and the kind of elegance</p>
<p>of the universe would be such that that kind of condensing point would then give</p>
<p>birth to another universe, out of itself. Like, which seems to be the-- an elegant logic that the universe</p>
<p>already does, as we started by saying rebirth and then</p>
<p>leads to another birth. And another aeon. But then he even went further, and he said the background radiation that we see with-- through our furthest</p>
<p>telescopes, that can now see, like, the very, very beginnings of the universe. He said there are certain objects that we're seeing in there, and I can't</p>
<p>quite remember what he called them, but there are certain shapes</p>
<p>and patterns and things that you're seeing, and you see them</p>
<p>over and over again. And his assumption was that those were the leftovers</p>
<p>from the previous aeon, from the previous universe</p>
<p>that we're seeing, and that really blew me away. I was like, 'Wow, that's from a physicist!' Who's willing to</p>
<p>kind of-- who's kind of reached the top of his game, he's able</p>
<p>to kind of take a few leaps. But that really seemed</p>
<p>to me to be [inaudible]. I've heard Ervin László describe the-- once you reflect</p>
<p>on the extraordinary precision of the unfolding of our</p>
<p>universe in the Big Bang, the magnitude of the perfection</p>
<p>of the balance of elements that had to be present in the first picoseconds</p>
<p>for it to unfold as it has, then his hypothesis was, 'Well, do we think that this is the</p>
<p>first time the universe has tried this?' There have been expansions</p>
<p>and contractions, and expansions and contractions,</p>
<p>and the universe is learning. And perhaps this isn't the first Big Bang. Perhaps this is the 1000th Big Bang. And it's gotten-- it's learned</p>
<p>from its previous experiences, and that's that background radiation,</p>
<p>the traces of which are there. It's constantly ironing out flaws, and perfecting, and perfecting,</p>
<p>and perfecting itself. Yeah. Of course this wide view. I think it's rich to take the wide view, to take the deep view,</p>
<p>and to look at very special developed beings who are kind of pushing the edge</p>
<p>of this large view. But I want to bring it back down to - Okay, how does this</p>
<p>impact me, here, today? How does this help me live</p>
<p>with the immediate problems that I'm dealing with, or with the</p>
<p>immediate choices that I'm living with? And I think it does, in the sense that</p>
<p>by-- it's an invitation to look at our life</p>
<p>as an intentional, intelligent convocation of circumstances,</p>
<p>not as a meaningless and not as a blind, deterministic</p>
<p>combination of circumstances. And if we engage our life circumstances as a-- an intentional challenge chosen us-- chosen for us, by us, at a time when we knew more, and we start to make choices in terms</p>
<p>of-- out of a deeper sense of engagement. That our choice does matter. Even if we don't see how it changes things immediately, we can trust that it</p>
<p>does change things in the long term. Then I think we will find that life changes,</p>
<p>the circumstances of our life changes. Things that were hard become soft,</p>
<p>things that were barren becomes richer. That's your experience</p>
<p>I'm sure with Gene Keys. Yeah.</p>
<p>And it gives us like-- for me, it gives us like a different kind of backdrop with which to</p>
<p>tackle the problems of the world. So the problems that we see today</p>
<p>around us, that worry us so much, it gives us an empowered view</p>
<p>from a much wider view. Like, to look at what we've just been looking at, those</p>
<p>cosmic background images. And then you come to the world today and you look at this tiny little</p>
<p>blue planet, with its problems, and, you know-- and they're very real and they're causing</p>
<p>a great deal of suffering. They always have done. But they're now more easily</p>
<p>seen than ever before. And we've enacted them globally</p>
<p>because of our technology. So we are, you know-- it means that, for me, I'm constantly reminding people that,</p>
<p>you know, action that comes from a state of trust is very different</p>
<p>from action that comes from fear. If we can dive into that field of wider trust, and we begin to make friends</p>
<p>with our own death. You know, instead of being-- it being something</p>
<p>that's kind of like, 'Ugh, it's coming. You know, I'm running out of time.' Instead of, like, that view, and having</p>
<p>this long-term view as an individual. And even, like, what I'm doing as a community, how about if a whole community</p>
<p>of people on the same wavelength play with this together? Like,</p>
<p>we're all going to come back, you know, we're going to return,</p>
<p>and we're going to return into this same -- I mean this is why I've</p>
<p>created these teachings -- I haven't created them, they've</p>
<p>appeared, because we can come back into them. And we can begin to, like -- and the teachings</p>
<p>are just the teachings. They're just enable us to kind-- to give</p>
<p>a focal point so that we can do our work, our continuous, progressive</p>
<p>evolutionary work as communities, rather than like, 'Okay, you've done</p>
<p>this great work, and then you've gone. And yeah, I might be reborn, but where?' If you're born into the same community</p>
<p>of beings, of souls, who are all committed to transmuting karma of the planet,</p>
<p>and come in with different gifts, and genius, and skills,</p>
<p>in different locations around the world, but we're interconnected</p>
<p>through the Internet, and through our body of teachings that kind of</p>
<p>have a resonance in our soul. So we recognise them again,</p>
<p>even as a child. You know, and synchronicity</p>
<p>helps us to find them. Suddenly, it's a different playground again! You don't have to say goodbye</p>
<p>to all your loved ones forever. You're going to remember them in different way-- you're going to bring</p>
<p>more of that awareness down through the transitionary</p>
<p>Bardo. And bring it-- and the more of us do that, that incarnate the memory through</p>
<p>the Bardos forwards in time, the more it kind-- this is my intuition, the more it will open up the Bardos themselves, so that more and more</p>
<p>people can remember. And it's all a game of memory, I think, that, you know, like, the more awareness we-- the more we play and participate,</p>
<p>the more that memory opens up. Because memory is</p>
<p>a strange thing, isn't it? Like, even individual memory? You can-- there are memory tricks</p>
<p>you can do, to, you know-- and therapeutically you can take</p>
<p>someone back into their memories. So there are things that you can do</p>
<p>to enhance memory. And there are things you can do forwards in time to ensure</p>
<p>that you don't forget. There are triggers,</p>
<p>you know, that you can-- I mean, there are lots of ways of playing with this, but there are things you can do</p>
<p>as the Lamas do, you know, the Tulkus. They sometimes leave objects that they retrieve in the next life. You know, and there are lots of tricks. Within-- once you know, the time-- you know once you've</p>
<p>kind of found a way through the wormholes, I think you can play more. And then we can</p>
<p>bring more and more awakening, you know, into the collective. You know, and I think</p>
<p>that that changes everything. It does. I think we're shifting slowly from</p>
<p>living an ego-based life which is grounded in this incarnation,</p>
<p>to living a soul-life which is grounded into this much,</p>
<p>much deeper life in the universe. It always struck me as significant</p>
<p>that in the classical story of the Buddha's enlightenment and he went</p>
<p>through the four watches of the night, in one of the watches of the night,</p>
<p>he saw all of his former lives. They all became living</p>
<p>part of his awareness. Now, to see your former lives,</p>
<p>to remember your former lives. It's not simply to remember who you were, but you bring all of that life</p>
<p>experience into who you are. So for me to see, to remember your</p>
<p>former lives, is to become the soul which gathers all that knowledge</p>
<p>and all that experience into one place. And when he did that, he became</p>
<p>transparent and shattered. He stopped the suffering. And the suffering is fundamentally living small, living as if this</p>
<p>body is the only thing that is you. And I think this is</p>
<p>happening historically. We are-- as you say,</p>
<p>the more we bring that memory forward, the more we live that memory, the more</p>
<p>we see that memory into the future. Another way of saying this is to say</p>
<ul>
<li>we are practising the skills of soul, inside time and space. And as our soul gets stronger,</li>
</ul>
<p>we begin to remember and have an intuitive feeling for relationships</p>
<p>that we have a deeper history with. And if people come at us as enemies,</p>
<p>well, let's heal them. I'm sorry what I did to you,</p>
<p>whatever it was, let me make it up to you. But more and more allies come. Because there's a-- waking</p>
<p>up is a social process. It's a generative process which has never,</p>
<p>ever been private, at any time in history. And I think this is what's happening. I think the soul is waking up inside time and space. That the human species is basically growing up on a scale the likes of which is really comparable about like 200,000 years ago</p>
<p>when we made the jump to our bigger brain. Except now the physical</p>
<p>plant isn't changing. But the awareness that is supported by the physical plant seems</p>
<p>to be changing exponentially. So I know that you and I share a vision of history, that we're entering into</p>
<p>a very, very challenging time, a time of darkening shadows. So I hope in our next conversation,</p>
<p>we can begin to put together our understanding of the dynamics of this</p>
<p>period of history that we're venturing, and the dynamics of soul growth.</p>
<p>That we both affirm so deeply. Yeah.</p>
<p>And how those two fit perfectly together and what you call the birth</p>
<p>of the diamond soul. And I also happen to call</p>
<p>it the diamond-awareness. And it is that memory</p>
<p>that transcends the lifetimes. And that maintaining that memory</p>
<p>between lives, it sure is-- I mean, for one thing, suddenly many people who I'm engaged with, like, they're suddenly excited</p>
<p>by being here, and by returning. As opposed to 'I want to get out</p>
<p>of here,' which has been the prevalent kind of feeling among</p>
<p>spiritual communities. 'I want to get out of here. You know, this is my last</p>
<p>incarnation, I'm off.' And that's-- I think there's a more compassionate view,</p>
<p>and I think a more exciting view. That we can actually bring-- you know and it's like a warrior's view as well. Spiritual warrior. Like,</p>
<p>this place needs us, it needs us here to do this work. So yeah I think that's why we're having these conversations, for me. I don't think the creative genius that gave birth to the galaxies,</p>
<p>and planets inside the galaxies, and solar systems, would inculcate--</p>
<p>and it created reincarnation. We didn't create it.</p>
<p>The religions didn't create it. Nature created it. And I don't think it would create</p>
<p>reincarnation to grow us to an awareness of our first inkling of our deep,</p>
<p>deep spiritual essence, with the purpose being, 'Okay, then you can go, then you can go.'</p>
<p>I think we've missed it. We don't understand that awakening is part of-- it is a process which</p>
<p>really is part of the transformation of time and space itself.</p>
<p>That we are here to change. We are changing the world. It really is heaven on Earth,</p>
<p>is what the process is about. Yeah, and the prophecy.</p>
<p>And the prophecy, yeah. Let's leave that as a seed for next time. That sounds good.</p>
<p>Wonderful. Thank you, Chris.</p>
<p>What a fantastic [inaudible]. And I'll just leave with this thought. I wonder what our personal former-life history is, that we meet in such ease</p>
<p>and fruitful dialogue, you and I . And so I honour the history</p>
<p>between us, whatever it is. I will contemplate that. Yeah. Much love.</p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p></body></html>

The idea that we all have to get past&nbsp;
the same finish line at the same time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.320
in order for things to work out right,
we all have to be saved before we die,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.360
or something like this,
that doesn't make nearly as much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.720
sense as we are developing flower garden.
We are different types of flowers which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.240
are developing and emerging&nbsp;
over large periods of time.&nbsp;

Welcome, Chris. It is a great joy to be with&nbsp;

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.080
you on New Thinking Allowed today. Thank you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.200
Emmy. It's wonderful to be&nbsp;
in conversation with you.&nbsp;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.920
This is our second interview together,&nbsp;
although we also had a live stream.&nbsp;

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.480
And in that first conversation, we talked about&nbsp;
your great book, LSD in the Mind of the Universe,&nbsp;

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.680
Diamonds from Heaven. And I'll link to that&nbsp;
interview in the upper right corner of the screen.&nbsp;

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.440
In your book and in that conversation, you&nbsp;
shared about how through your 73 LSD sessions,&nbsp;

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.120
you experienced many deaths and rebirths.&nbsp;
And today we're going to explore the notion&nbsp;

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.880
that it sounds like you came&nbsp;
to an understanding of that we&nbsp;

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.080
all have our own individual or personal karma,&nbsp;
and that we do reincarnate for the collective&nbsp;

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.040
good or benefit of all toward what&nbsp;
you describe as the future human.&nbsp;

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.120
Yeah. To get us started, how did you&nbsp;
become interested in this topic of&nbsp;

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.360
personal but also collective&nbsp;
karma and reincarnation?&nbsp;

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.480
Well, the first book I wrote as an academic was&nbsp;
Life Cycles, Reincarnation and the Web of Life.&nbsp;

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.120
So I was interested in reincarnation early in my&nbsp;
career. I encountered Ian Stevenson's research&nbsp;

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.760
at the University of Virginia. At about the&nbsp;
same time, I encountered Stan Grof's research&nbsp;

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.440
in his book, Realms of the Human Unconscious.&nbsp;
So I really took in Stevenson's research&nbsp;

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.800
deeply, and I began to see the world in a way&nbsp;
that I had never seen it before. I began to see&nbsp;

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.080
the world in terms of reincarnation through a lens&nbsp;
of reincarnation, understanding that every life&nbsp;

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.320
is continuation of lives lived in the past&nbsp;
and is leading towards lives in the future.&nbsp;

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.480
So I began to study the&nbsp;
evidence for reincarnation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.960
and I studied a lot of past life therapy&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:43.440
cases, and I began to sort of understand the&nbsp;
deeper mechanisms of how lives start many things,&nbsp;

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.640
they don't get finished, and they sometimes&nbsp;
experience injury and wounds that don't get&nbsp;

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.360
healed, or they have hopes and expectations&nbsp;
that are not fulfilled. And those transfer into&nbsp;

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.960
subsequent former lives, not in a simple or&nbsp;
simplistic way, but in a very complex and subtle&nbsp;

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.280
way, that we are living in&nbsp;
a sense the continuation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.800
of projects that began before our life,
and our life will lead to a continuation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.160
of projects after we die, after our body dies.
So that was all kind of working itself out in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:26.240
mind. And then when I entered into my psychedelic
work, that was all affirmed, and that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.000
elaborated. I had numerous&nbsp;
experiences of former lives,&nbsp;

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.880
and the reality of reincarnation as just a&nbsp;
fact of life was presented as kind of a natural&nbsp;

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.320
exposition of spiritual reality and how&nbsp;
the physical world and the spiritual world&nbsp;

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.800
are deeply intertwined in this evolutionary&nbsp;
process. But all of that thought of so far&nbsp;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.000
is all on the level of personal karma, you know,&nbsp;
personal cause and effect, personal choice,&nbsp;

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.160
conditionings transferred from lifetime to&nbsp;
lifetime. But in the process of doing the&nbsp;

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:10.160
psychedelic exploration, I also dropped in, began&nbsp;
to drop into levels of consciousness that were not&nbsp;

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.400
personal but were collective. Jung's concept of&nbsp;
the collective unconscious is an early exploration&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:25.760
of this idea that I've dropped into levels of&nbsp;
reality, of conscious reality, where the working&nbsp;

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:33.760
unit was not an individual human being, but the&nbsp;
working unit was an entire species. And I began&nbsp;

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:42.240
to have experiences that were working themselves&nbsp;
out in my individual psychedelic sessions that&nbsp;

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.720
were not personal. They were really focused on&nbsp;
collective dynamics, so that I describe in a&nbsp;

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.480
chapter called The Ocean of Suffering, entering&nbsp;
into what I later came to understand were memory&nbsp;

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:04.240
matrices held in the collective psyche of all&nbsp;
the suffering that members of its species had&nbsp;

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.880
experienced if it was unresolved by the time&nbsp;
they died, memories of war, of killing, of rape,&nbsp;

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:19.920
of pain, drought, incest, just lots and lots&nbsp;
of painful memories. And I began to understand&nbsp;

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:28.320
that just as the individual can be burdened by&nbsp;
their past trauma, the psyche of the collective&nbsp;

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.200
consciousness of our species is likewise burdened&nbsp;
by its collective trauma. And then so that led to&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.880
a deepening of an understanding about the&nbsp;
relationship of individual and collective&nbsp;

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.840
karma, individual karma and collective karma. That&nbsp;
really is the fundamental theme of my second book,&nbsp;

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.640
Dark Night, Early Dawn, that has to do with&nbsp;
examining that when you go very, very deep,&nbsp;

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.480
that boundary between the individual and the&nbsp;
collective dissolves, and it leads to a much&nbsp;

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:09.040
more dynamic relationship between what's happening&nbsp;
in our individual lives and what's happening in&nbsp;

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.240
this life of the species of which we are part.&nbsp;
And that, of course, is contextualized within&nbsp;

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.520
the life of the planet, the life of the galaxy&nbsp;
and so on and so forth. And so I just had many&nbsp;

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:29.920
experiences of being initiated into the life&nbsp;
of our species at a collective level. So I&nbsp;

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:38.240
dissolved, not like into the mystical state of&nbsp;
oneness with God, but before getting to that,&nbsp;

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:46.080
I dissolved into the consciousness of our&nbsp;
species. And I began to have experiences&nbsp;

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.760
of how the species is evolving through&nbsp;
collective karma and collective reincarnation,&nbsp;

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.280
and individuals within that matrix are&nbsp;
evolving through individual karma and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.120
individual reincarnation.
Before we go any further,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.560
I know we mentioned this&nbsp;
in our previous interview.&nbsp;

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:14.400
We are not suggesting that people engage in LSD&nbsp;
per se in order to have these same experiences.&nbsp;

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.880
It's not necessary for a person to get&nbsp;
in touch with these parts of themselves&nbsp;

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:28.320
to use those substances necessarily. Absolutely.&nbsp;
What I did was illegal. I did it because&nbsp;

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:35.680
I felt that it was wrong for these important&nbsp;
mind-opening drugs to be made illegal.&nbsp;

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.920
But I would never recommend that anyone else&nbsp;
break the law. And there are other techniques&nbsp;

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.680
that we can use in order to get access to these&nbsp;
deep levels of consciousness. This is simply just&nbsp;

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.640
one of the ways that I entered into this domain.&nbsp;
I also did three years of hypnotherapy, exploring&nbsp;

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.880
my own former lives in that process. It had&nbsp;
nothing to do with any psychedelics at all.&nbsp;

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:08.000
You have a whole career as a professor of&nbsp;
philosophy of religion. What can you share&nbsp;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.840
with us about the spiritual evidence, if you will?&nbsp;
And then we can go to the scientific evidence as&nbsp;

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:24.480
well for reincarnation. Well, I start on the&nbsp;
empirical side. I found Ian Stevenson's work&nbsp;

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:32.320
intellectually and philosophically compelling.&nbsp;
He and his teams have done research and contacted&nbsp;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:38.080
thousands of children around the world who have&nbsp;
spontaneous memories of their most immediate&nbsp;

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:45.280
previous life. And he was able to document those&nbsp;
memories in sufficient detail to be, I think,&nbsp;

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:52.560
intellectually credible and providing overwhelming&nbsp;
evidence that reincarnation is just a fact of&nbsp;

00:10:52.560 --> 00:11:01.360
life. Then later, when I began to study in&nbsp;
past life therapy literature, and I began to&nbsp;

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:09.680
walk and work with people who had experience&nbsp;
helping people remember their deep past in order&nbsp;

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.880
to heal, but also in order to bring forward&nbsp;
consciously the many gifts that are stored in&nbsp;

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.920
their past. Because not all, you know, we have a&nbsp;
tendency to think that we inherit mostly problems&nbsp;

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:29.600
from our past, but that's not true. We inherit&nbsp;
all the pluses, all the benefits, all the&nbsp;

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:39.040
hard work that they've done in certain areas.&nbsp;
In my meditation, I began to experience the&nbsp;

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.560
boundaryless nature of consciousness itself.&nbsp;
I knew that there were dimensions of my mind,&nbsp;

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.160
my consciousness that were transpersonal,&nbsp;
that went beyond my personal identity.&nbsp;

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:59.120
And then when I went into deeper psychedelic&nbsp;
work, I had many experiences which showed me that&nbsp;

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.800
reincarnation is simply true. It's just a fact&nbsp;
of life. And Stevenson's evidence is really,&nbsp;

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:11.520
really important, but it's the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;
Because by itself, his evidence does not give us a&nbsp;

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:19.040
comprehensive picture of how reincarnation works,&nbsp;
how the universe is working in reincarnation.&nbsp;

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.000
There's so much we don't know. I mean, I want to&nbsp;
say upfront, we don't have any idea of what the&nbsp;

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.880
physics of the soul is. We don't know how&nbsp;
consciousness leaves at death and brings all&nbsp;

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.360
the memories forward. We don't really understand&nbsp;
the physics of how that consciousness reintegrates&nbsp;

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:47.200
with another incarnation, how its store of&nbsp;
knowledge interacts with or interfaces with&nbsp;

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:54.000
genetic conditions, genetic and social conditions.&nbsp;
There's so much that we don't know. There's a lot&nbsp;

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.880
to be learned with research&nbsp;
ahead. But experientially,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.120
when you remember your previous
lives and when you run deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:08.080
into the fabric of life so that you&nbsp;
begin to understand that our entire&nbsp;

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:14.960
species is reincarnating generation by generation,&nbsp;
it's not just individuals who are living and&nbsp;

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:23.600
growing. The entire species is living and growing&nbsp;
collectively in that process. It's just there's&nbsp;

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:30.000
theory and then there's direct experience. And in&nbsp;
this case, theory and direct experience reinforce&nbsp;

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.520
each other. Yes, and your experiences using LSD&nbsp;
and other forms of substances to take you deeper&nbsp;

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:47.680
beyond your personal self, you described how you&nbsp;
really felt a sense of oneness. And can you kind&nbsp;

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:56.000
of recap that a little bit for us or for those&nbsp;
who might be new to your story? This is a deeper&nbsp;

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.560
theme than simply the theme of reincarnation.&nbsp;
So let's go there and then we can bring it back&nbsp;

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:08.240
into reincarnation however you would like. The&nbsp;
truth of reincarnation is a truth that we are an&nbsp;

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:15.920
evolving consciousness over a large, large swath&nbsp;
of time. But there are many other truths. And one&nbsp;

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:22.000
of the other truths is if we ask, where did&nbsp;
we come from? And what are we? And in essence,&nbsp;

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.800
underneath all this social conditioning and&nbsp;
psychological conditioning, what are we?&nbsp;

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.560
And there, the spiritual traditions are&nbsp;
very clear and they speak with one voice,&nbsp;

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:40.640
that the essence of the individual is the&nbsp;
essence of the totality, that we are at core,&nbsp;

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.440
our essence is the essence of the divine, or&nbsp;
the essence of God, if you use that language.&nbsp;

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:55.360
And so that's another truth. And then you go&nbsp;
deeper into that, you realize that what your&nbsp;

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:01.760
essence is, is the same as the essence of every&nbsp;
living thing in this world, every so-called&nbsp;

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:09.520
inanimate thing. So that when that happens, when&nbsp;
that opens, there's a profound feeling of oneness&nbsp;

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:17.920
that, in a sense, self dissolves in the sense of&nbsp;
there being a boundary, a firm boundary between&nbsp;

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.200
self and other that disappears.&nbsp;
And one experiences the marvelous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.120
miracle of life living and breathing
as one. You are just part of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.920
It's surrounding you. There's&nbsp;
a profound feeling of intimacy,&nbsp;

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:43.120
kinship, those graces of being touched by&nbsp;
oneness. They can change your life forever,&nbsp;

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.720
because it shows you a truth that even&nbsp;
if you can't sustain that experience,&nbsp;

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.080
you've seen the truth, you know the truth of&nbsp;
it. You can use that truth to guide your life.&nbsp;

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.520
It leads you to become more&nbsp;
compassionate with people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:03.040
It leads you to become more compassionate
with yourself. You always are kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.000
spontaneously looking out&nbsp;
for the good of the whole.&nbsp;

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.760
That's the natural outcome of experiencing&nbsp;
oneness, is compassion. That's why in the&nbsp;

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:21.040
mystical traditions, wisdom, insight, and&nbsp;
compassion move hand in hand. The deeper&nbsp;

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.520
you experience oneness, the more compassionate&nbsp;
you become. Can you describe a little bit about&nbsp;

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:34.640
your own personal experience of that oneness and&nbsp;
what that was like for you? That's a challenging&nbsp;

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:43.600
question, because to answer your question, I have&nbsp;
to remember. And to remember, I have to sink into&nbsp;

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:52.320
the memory, otherwise just a reading of headlines&nbsp;
of it. And that takes a little time. But working&nbsp;

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:59.600
within the restrictions we have, one of the&nbsp;
things I learned is oneness is not like a switch&nbsp;

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.160
that goes on and off. But there are many degrees&nbsp;
of oneness. There are many stages of initiation&nbsp;

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.840
into oneness. One can have a perception of&nbsp;
oneness. One can touch the edges of oneness and&nbsp;

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:19.280
feel the truth of oneness in the world. But then&nbsp;
you can go deeper into actually kind of dissolving&nbsp;

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:26.080
into the quantum structure, if you will. I'm using&nbsp;
that metaphorically of oneness. It's a deeper&nbsp;

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:36.880
immersion in the living totality of life. It's&nbsp;
challenging because at least what I've learned&nbsp;

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.960
is that deeper states of consciousness exist at&nbsp;
higher levels of energy. So the deeper you're&nbsp;

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.360
going into a reality in the consciousness, you're&nbsp;
going into a higher and higher and higher level&nbsp;

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:58.720
of energy. So oneness with the totality or&nbsp;
oneness with the divine is an extremely intense&nbsp;

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.400
state of consciousness and state of&nbsp;
energy to move into. And in my case,&nbsp;

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.880
I approached it through going through years&nbsp;
and years of very intense purifications&nbsp;

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:21.040
in my psychedelic sessions. When that oneness,&nbsp;
when you're graced with an opening into oneness,&nbsp;

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:29.280
it's like the entire world comes alive in a new&nbsp;
way. And it's like there's a song in the world&nbsp;

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:37.040
that you maybe hadn't heard before, but&nbsp;
it's always been there. There is a joy&nbsp;

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:46.000
and a falling away of all forms of loneliness and&nbsp;
a birthing into an exquisite spiritual intimacy.&nbsp;

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:54.320
I should say it's an intimacy which is both&nbsp;
spiritual and physical because it overflows&nbsp;

00:18:54.320 --> 00:19:02.560
in compassion towards the world. And it also&nbsp;
overflows in homecoming, a feeling of homecoming&nbsp;

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:10.560
to one's essential nature, one's essential&nbsp;
being. And it's like, finally I found you,&nbsp;

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:18.880
or finally I've been found by you. And&nbsp;
then it's just how deep do you want to go?&nbsp;

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:26.400
How deep into the oneness of existence do you&nbsp;
dare to go? And I think if one goes too fast,&nbsp;

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:33.600
it becomes very challenging and difficult.&nbsp;
It takes time to assimilate oneness. And then&nbsp;

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:40.720
it takes time after you've had the experience to&nbsp;
know what to do with it. We talk about integrating&nbsp;

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:48.960
our psychedelic experiences. And I'm thinking&nbsp;
in many ways that we don't really understand yet&nbsp;

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:55.600
how these profound experiences are&nbsp;
impacting our psychological development,&nbsp;

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.840
our psychospiritual development, because&nbsp;
Indigenous people have been having these&nbsp;

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.800
experiences for millennia, of course. But we&nbsp;
in the West are relatively new to cultivating&nbsp;

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.520
these experiences. And so we're taking all of our&nbsp;
learning and all of our scientific knowledge and&nbsp;

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:20.480
all of our high academic knowledge into these&nbsp;
states. And in some ways, we're like the first&nbsp;

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:27.200
generation to combine everything that we have&nbsp;
learned about the world from science and critical&nbsp;

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:36.400
analysis, and now entering into these deep,&nbsp;
deep states of consciousness. And we're holding&nbsp;

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:42.960
memories that very few people in history&nbsp;
have tried to hold. We're holding memories&nbsp;

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:50.240
of profound transcendence, profound intimacy&nbsp;
with the divine, profound transcendence of time,&nbsp;

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:59.040
moving into deep time, permutations of&nbsp;
time, moving into cosmic void experiences.&nbsp;

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.280
And those are living memories. I mean, I can&nbsp;
tell you what I was doing on a particular day&nbsp;

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.960
and a particular year 30 years ago. They're&nbsp;
very specific. And I remember them the way that&nbsp;

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.960
most people remember their 50th birthday party.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.280
You can just remember it.&nbsp;
But how those experiences,&nbsp;

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:28.080
which are so transcendent, how they are impacting&nbsp;
us and infusing themselves deeper into our being,&nbsp;

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.760
I think we're just beginning&nbsp;
to map some of those processes.&nbsp;

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:43.600
From those experiences, it sounds like you had&nbsp;
a more personal insight into how everything that&nbsp;

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:52.480
each of us perceivably individually&nbsp;
do, think, feel impacts the oneness.&nbsp;

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:58.320
Yes. Think of it this way. Let's say any of&nbsp;
the list of negative qualities that we have&nbsp;

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.720
personally that we're bothered by and we would&nbsp;
like to get rid of and we would like to transform,&nbsp;

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:10.400
etc., etc. None of those are private. All of these&nbsp;
are part of a social configuration. Any problem&nbsp;

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:18.400
we have personally is part of a social problem.&nbsp;
It's part of a cultural problem. So where is the&nbsp;

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:26.320
line between solving my personal issue and&nbsp;
the society solving its collective issue?&nbsp;

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.840
Now classically in Western thought, we have&nbsp;
thought we're all individual monads. We can't&nbsp;

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.600
communicate with each other. We're all&nbsp;
separate, self-contained, egoic structures.&nbsp;

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.440
So we're kind of, we may be one in aggregate,&nbsp;
but we're really just a whole bunch of people&nbsp;

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.040
shoved up against each other and we each have&nbsp;
our own individual experience. But I don't think&nbsp;

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.080
that's the way it works. At least that's not&nbsp;
what I was shown. What I have experienced is that&nbsp;

00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:04.480
each human being is a cell in the tissue of&nbsp;
humanity. Every mind is a light, a cell of light&nbsp;

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:12.320
in the fabric of human consciousness. And&nbsp;
even our bodies are cells within the body of&nbsp;

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:20.800
humanity as a whole. And that just as we don't,&nbsp;
none of our problems, our issues, our virtues,&nbsp;

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.400
we arrive at them individually. We kind of arrive&nbsp;
at them together collectively. They're part of an&nbsp;

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.760
historical landscape, part of a&nbsp;
cultural landscape. Also when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.360
solve our problems, when we have
spiritual breakthroughs, when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.200
have psychological breakthroughs,&nbsp;
those breakthroughs radiate out&nbsp;

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:47.040
into the world and they touch lives. Now that's&nbsp;
all spiritual traditions have recognized this.&nbsp;

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:54.000
Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu&nbsp;
traditions have recognized this collective nature.&nbsp;

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.560
One of the ways I experienced it as kind of&nbsp;
empirically demonstrated was in my classroom.&nbsp;

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.680
Because all the years when I was working very&nbsp;
intensely with psychedelics, I was working very&nbsp;

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.160
privately and because they were illegal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.800
I couldn't talk about it. And&nbsp;
I never talked to my students&nbsp;

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:18.160
about my own personal psychedelic practice. But&nbsp;
what I found over time was that my psychedelic&nbsp;

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:29.360
practice was impacting my students. And I began&nbsp;
to have experiences or have access to their minds&nbsp;

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:37.280
in a way that was showing me that my&nbsp;
individual process of transformation&nbsp;

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:44.480
was radiating out and influencing other&nbsp;
people's processes of self-transformation.&nbsp;

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:50.720
And this I was completely, I didn't expect this&nbsp;
at all. And it took me a while, it took me years&nbsp;

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:56.560
really to understand what was happening until&nbsp;
eventually I wrote my book, The Living Classroom,&nbsp;

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:05.680
which has now just come out in a new edition&nbsp;
where I can explicitly say that the practices&nbsp;

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:11.120
that I was doing, which was driving this&nbsp;
kind of collective awakening in my classroom,&nbsp;

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:20.000
was a psychedelic practice primarily. But it was&nbsp;
showing me that truly we are in a boundaryless&nbsp;

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.840
condition, not just in high subtle mystical&nbsp;
states of awareness, but we are in a boundaryless&nbsp;

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:36.880
condition all the time, that there's an always&nbsp;
a porosity, an interconnectedness between what's&nbsp;

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.640
going on in our life and what's going on in&nbsp;
the world around us. So that I think we have&nbsp;

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:50.160
more and more reason to believe that when we live&nbsp;
our life well and when we rise to the challenges&nbsp;

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:57.520
that are presented to us in life, whatever&nbsp;
they are, whether they're surgical, political,&nbsp;

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:03.760
social activists, meditative, psychological,&nbsp;
whatever they are, artistic, whatever those&nbsp;

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.920
breakthroughs are, that those breakthroughs&nbsp;
have a nourishing effect on everyone around us.&nbsp;

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.720
Among the world's spiritual&nbsp;
traditions and religions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:20.560
some of them are advocates or proponents
of reincarnation. They just take it as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:27.680
given, it's natural. And then there are other
religions and practices where some have suggested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.320
that has been removed from those religious
practices. And I'm just wondering if you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:39.680
comment about that, because there are people who
might adhere to a particular religion where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:46.480
have been taught. Reincarnation just does not
exist. And in fact, you have one shot to get it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.360
right. And that's it, you're either going to go
to heaven or hell, or maybe purgatory. If you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.600
really screwed up, you could also go there.
Yeah, isn't that interesting? It's interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.520
You know, religions have many levels to them.
There's kind of the exterior lay level of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.800
religion, and then there's the esoteric, mystical,
high deep spiritual practitioner level of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.040
religion. And what we find is&nbsp;
that some religions like the&nbsp;

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:20.400
religions of the East, Buddhism, Hinduism, even&nbsp;
Taoism, they naturally affirm reincarnation.&nbsp;

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:26.960
But even in the West, where reincarnation&nbsp;
is not absorbed into the primary religions,&nbsp;

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.960
it's often present in the mystical branch&nbsp;
of that religion. So that in Judaism,&nbsp;

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.680
Judaism doesn't affirm reincarnation, rabbinic&nbsp;
Judaism doesn't at a collective level.&nbsp;

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:47.600
But Hasidism, the mystical tradition in Judaism,&nbsp;
it does. And likewise, in Islam, traditional&nbsp;

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:54.720
mainstream Islam does not place any emphasis&nbsp;
on reincarnation. But mystical Islam, the Sufi&nbsp;

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.360
tradition, does affirm reincarnation. With&nbsp;
Christianity, it's a little more complicated&nbsp;

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:07.680
because Christianity tended to execute any of&nbsp;
its mystics who were affirming reincarnation.&nbsp;

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.360
There have been crusades, of course,&nbsp;
against the Cathars and others.&nbsp;

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:19.280
When we look back at the history of Christianity,&nbsp;
it appears that reincarnation was taught by&nbsp;

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:26.080
certain early sects within Christianity. It was&nbsp;
taught in what later came to be called Gnostic&nbsp;

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:33.760
sects, which were then decided to be heretical and&nbsp;
not accepted. But it was taught as a standard kind&nbsp;

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:41.440
of operating interpretation of Christianity for&nbsp;
hundreds of years. But then as the ecclesiastical&nbsp;

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:48.080
church began to consolidate itself under the,&nbsp;
remember the background, this around third,&nbsp;

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:54.160
fourth century AD, under the falling of the&nbsp;
collapse of the Roman Empire and a really&nbsp;

00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:01.600
disintegration of order at the social level, the&nbsp;
church really believed that its survival depended&nbsp;

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:10.080
upon a strong ecclesiastical center. Reincarnation&nbsp;
gave too much autonomy to individuals to work out&nbsp;

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.720
their own reincarnation. So&nbsp;
a particular council was held&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.680
and there was a decision that reincarnation
was not going to be included as an acceptable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.720
form of Christianity for this particular reason,
I think. It's not that it's incompatible with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.120
teaching of Jesus. They never said that it
was incompatible. It's that it gives too&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.520
much autonomy. It undermines&nbsp;
the primacy of ecclesiastical&nbsp;

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:42.000
authority in the church. Now that may have been&nbsp;
helpful for Christianity at that time. It may&nbsp;

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.520
have helped Christianity survive the dark ages&nbsp;
that followed. But now that we have reincarnation&nbsp;

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:56.160
evidence coming forward from scholarly sources,&nbsp;
there is nothing in Christianity that prohibits&nbsp;

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:04.880
Christians from reassessing that old teaching&nbsp;
and looking at it anew. We know that from several&nbsp;

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:14.400
national surveys that approximately 25% of&nbsp;
American Catholics believe in reincarnation,&nbsp;

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.520
and it's about the same&nbsp;
number for Protestants, 26%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:25.280
for Protestants. And so clearly 25% of Catholics
aren't waiting for a papal encyclical saying that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.960
reincarnation is okay to accept. In fact,
the largest chapter I have in my book in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.680
life cycles is a chapter on&nbsp;
reincarnation in Christianity&nbsp;

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.400
where I, as most of my students who I&nbsp;
was teaching at this state university,&nbsp;

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:47.200
they came out of Christian backgrounds. They were&nbsp;
also trained to follow the evidence, to believe,&nbsp;

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.560
let your beliefs be guided&nbsp;
by the evidence. So they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.520
having evidence of reincarnation presented
to them, and yet their religious tradition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:02.000
said that evidence can't be true, but they saw the
quality of the evidence. And in this chapter, I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.280
basically sharing my experiences with students,
helping them understand how they can reevaluate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:15.040
reincarnation and what a reincarnationist
Christianity might look like. And I outline&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.080
a minimal option and a maximal option,
but trying to show the way in which you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:27.680
affirm deep Christian values and even a dogma
and incorporate a reincarnation element. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:36.000
it makes more sense, you know, because the real
devilment of Western theology, which believes, or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.240
Christian theology, which believes in a one-time
through metaphysics, is that it makes life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.520
radically inexplicable. Why do some people
have so much and some people have so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.720
little? Why are some people so&nbsp;
burdened with pain and suffering&nbsp;

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:59.360
and some people just have so much ease in their&nbsp;
lifetime? And ultimately, this gets thrown into&nbsp;

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.560
an inscrutable God, a God that makes no sense&nbsp;
whatsoever. We just can't understand it. We just&nbsp;

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.920
have to live it and abide by its jurisdiction,&nbsp;
and hopefully things will work out well.&nbsp;

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.680
But when you open up to a reincarnational&nbsp;
perspective, suddenly certain possibilities&nbsp;

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:22.880
emerge and things begin to make more sense.&nbsp;
And suddenly, the inscrutability is not God's&nbsp;

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.560
inscrutability. It's an&nbsp;
inscrutability that is introduced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:33.840
by believing something which isn't true,
and that is that we live on life only once. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:41.120
let's be careful. We have to say these things
carefully. Chris Bache only lives once. Soul,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.800
which Chris Bache is part&nbsp;
of, that soul lives more than&nbsp;

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:52.640
once. So, you know, you just have to, you know,&nbsp;
say things carefully to make your points clear.&nbsp;

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:59.680
Yeah, the personality or the identity of&nbsp;
Chris Bache or Emmy Vadnais lives once.&nbsp;

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:08.800
However, the soul that is our consciousness, our&nbsp;
energy or animates us or however you term that,&nbsp;

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.720
lives on perhaps forever.
Lives on. That's right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:20.000
It's like each personality, each&nbsp;
incarnation is a facet of the diamond.&nbsp;

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.040
The diamond lives forever. The facet&nbsp;
doesn't necessarily live forever. Well,&nbsp;

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.760
it lives forever in the diamond,&nbsp;
but the diamond lives forever. Yeah.&nbsp;

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:39.520
The story of Jesus's death, where he rises&nbsp;
on the third day, some have suggested that&nbsp;

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:45.040
is really a metaphor for reincarnation.
It's an interesting question, and I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:54.880
an appendix in life cycles where I address
interpretations of certain biblical passages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:00.720
which have been offered to suggest that Jesus
himself believed in reincarnation. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:08.800
we get into a real biblical studies, you know,
rabbit hole on that one. Yeah. Yeah, and my sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:14.480
is that I don't think there's compelling evidence
that he did teach reincarnation, but there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.840
certainly is very strong evidence that his
teaching is compatible with reincarnation. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:25.440
I mention it because it is a very
significant holiday Easter for many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.360
Christians and Catholics.
My first love, my first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.760
academic pursuit was in New Testament&nbsp;
studies, and I learned Greek and Hebrew,&nbsp;

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:39.520
and I really was going to become a New Testament&nbsp;
scholar, but I changed and shifted later on. But&nbsp;

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.600
up through my masters, I was&nbsp;
doing biblical studies work.&nbsp;

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.400
We learned that the oldest gospel, Mark's gospel,&nbsp;
does not have a resurrection, does not have an&nbsp;

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.360
empty tomb seen in it. In&nbsp;
fact, it ends with death,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:53.360 --> 00:35:00.880
and the power, the influence of the story of the
resurrection was so strong from the later gospels,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:07.200
Matthew, Luke, and John, that there was an actual,
a new ending added in the last chapter of Mark's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:13.760
gospel to include that kind of experience.
I think that when we ask historically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.200
what is the deepest level of experience that may
lie behind the belief in the resurrection,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:26.800
I think it is the experience that Jesus' followers
experienced him as being alive, even though he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:32.400
was dead. He was alive, and&nbsp;
therefore death is conquered.&nbsp;

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:40.320
Christian theology tended to interpret that in&nbsp;
unique terms that made Jesus' survival of death&nbsp;

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:47.920
somehow unique, and he was uniquely the Son of&nbsp;
God, and uniquely sharing this gift with humanity,&nbsp;

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.600
who accepts it on faith. That's one way of&nbsp;
interpreting it, and another way of interpreting&nbsp;

00:35:53.600 --> 00:36:00.240
is that what he's showing us is a universal&nbsp;
truth, that when we die, we are still alive.&nbsp;

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.120
We are still alive. There's a&nbsp;
larger dynamic unfolding here.&nbsp;

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:14.080
Going back to the oneness that physics shows&nbsp;
seems to be a reality with quantum entanglement.&nbsp;

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:19.600
Some people really embrace that, find it&nbsp;
beautiful, such as yourself. I think it's&nbsp;

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.560
quite beautiful, although there are&nbsp;
probably people listening to this thinking,&nbsp;

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:31.040
well, I don't want to be a part of that other&nbsp;
individual, and I know it's not just humans,&nbsp;

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:38.320
there's also creatures and animals and&nbsp;
bacteria that we're all a part of as well.&nbsp;

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.920
I'm wondering if you want to&nbsp;
comment on those thoughts.&nbsp;

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:50.320
I think when we first begin to entertain&nbsp;
possibilities that we are larger than we&nbsp;

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:54.880
conventionally have thought that we are, and that&nbsp;
we have these interconnections which are larger&nbsp;

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:01.840
than we thought that we are, I understand the&nbsp;
kind of fear and reflex to draw back and say,&nbsp;

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:09.600
not me, that doesn't work. That's understandable.&nbsp;
It's a natural reflex, but if we let that pass&nbsp;

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:16.160
and we sort of relax and begin to look at the&nbsp;
data, if we begin to look at near-death episode&nbsp;

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:22.720
research, people who get glimpses of what's&nbsp;
going on behind the scenes, and we look at not&nbsp;

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.800
just a few of them but look at hundreds of them&nbsp;
and begin to sort out the universal threads that&nbsp;

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:36.400
run through their accounts, when we look at&nbsp;
past-life therapy research and look at the&nbsp;

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:44.880
demonstrated continuity between lives and the&nbsp;
richness which emerges in a person's life when&nbsp;

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:54.720
they untangle some of those knots from their&nbsp;
past. When we just begin to look deeply into&nbsp;

00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:00.720
where did this come from, where did this&nbsp;
body-mind come from, and we trace its long&nbsp;

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:09.520
evolutionary pedigree back through its physical&nbsp;
pedigree on the emergence of our beautiful body,&nbsp;

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:16.720
it turns out that the mind has a similar, elegant,&nbsp;
magnificent pedigree reaching back through time,&nbsp;

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:25.680
and the more we absorb the fact that this body&nbsp;
is not ours privately and our mind is not ours&nbsp;

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:31.760
privately, it's always been a collective summation&nbsp;
in a way, always from the start, then I think that&nbsp;

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:39.120
feeling of anxiety or pushback softens&nbsp;
and we begin to open to a different world,&nbsp;

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:44.400
and it's not a world that dissolves the&nbsp;
individual or washes out the individual,&nbsp;

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:52.400
it's a world which actually affirms the individual&nbsp;
very deeply, but it contextualizes the individual&nbsp;

00:38:52.400 --> 00:39:00.000
within a web work of interconnections which is&nbsp;
larger than the individual, which we draw from&nbsp;

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.280
and we give back to, just as a leaf draws energy&nbsp;
from the tree and gives back energy to the tree,&nbsp;

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:15.920
and it becomes a natural way of seeing things,&nbsp;
it's just an easy secondary way of seeing things,&nbsp;

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.560
and I'm glad the physicists have jumped on with&nbsp;
quantum physics and unified systems theory and&nbsp;

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:27.840
all those good things, but fundamentally this can&nbsp;
be an experiential thing, that when we quiet our&nbsp;

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:37.440
mind, when we calm our heart and we enter into&nbsp;
deeper states of self-aware stillness, then there&nbsp;

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:45.680
are perceptions, there are instincts which are&nbsp;
usually so subtle that we don't notice them,&nbsp;

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:53.760
but in the space of a quiet meditative mind these&nbsp;
things make themselves felt, and when these arise&nbsp;

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:59.680
you begin to realize that it's like they're&nbsp;
threads that connect us to other people's lives,&nbsp;

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.560
that there's no breaking these threads,&nbsp;
they're part of the fabric of life,&nbsp;

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:10.000
just like there's no breaking the threads between&nbsp;
any one leaf on a tree and other leaves on the&nbsp;

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.040
tree, they are connected into the same organism.&nbsp;
Yeah, and the roots of the trees, the roots,&nbsp;

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:22.320
I like how you're describing it as a&nbsp;
collective mind or collective consciousness&nbsp;

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.360
that we are all a part of, and I agree with you,&nbsp;
I had the pleasure of speaking with Jill Bolte&nbsp;

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:34.720
Taylor who has written the book My Stroke of&nbsp;
Insight, and followed up where she had a stroke&nbsp;

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:40.000
and the left side of her brain went offline&nbsp;
and she only had the right side of her brain,&nbsp;

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:47.120
and she talked about how she felt this merging&nbsp;
of oneness and could even sense the energy that&nbsp;

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:54.000
people were bringing into her space even if they&nbsp;
were just visiting for no less than five minutes,&nbsp;

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.640
and she wrote a follow-up book about&nbsp;
Whole Brain Living because she wanted to&nbsp;

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:06.160
share with people how they can also have these&nbsp;
experiences as well. What is the significance&nbsp;

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.520
of reincarnation, how does karma play&nbsp;
a role with that, and how does it&nbsp;

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:18.320
give meaning to our lives or even change&nbsp;
our lives if we engage with that potential?&nbsp;

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:24.720
Well, that's a large question. So let me just&nbsp;
start with how it impacted me and share with you&nbsp;

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:31.440
maybe some of how it impacts the students that&nbsp;
I've shared these ideas with for decades. First,&nbsp;

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:38.880
I think it changes everything. It makes life more&nbsp;
intelligible. It makes the experience that all of&nbsp;

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:46.080
us have make more sense. All of us have things&nbsp;
that we know how to do that no one ever taught us,&nbsp;

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:51.760
or we have aptitudes towards certain types of&nbsp;
activities that are different from everyone&nbsp;

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:58.480
else in our family. Some people are oriented&nbsp;
towards private intellectual chess-like games,&nbsp;

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:04.800
and other people like full contact rugby and&nbsp;
social things. There's all these differences.&nbsp;

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:12.080
Some people have tremendous capacity to create&nbsp;
in art and music, and other people are writers.&nbsp;

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.040
Where do those come from? Where do&nbsp;
those qualities and traits come from?&nbsp;

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:23.680
Classically, we think they come through genetic&nbsp;
mutation. It's random. It's just accidental.&nbsp;

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:29.040
There's no logic to it. You got a good luck?&nbsp;
Good. You good genes? Good. They're great.&nbsp;

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:35.680
But when you actually sink into them, it begins&nbsp;
to make more sense that everything which is large&nbsp;

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:44.080
in a life comes from a line of choices where&nbsp;
at some time in our past, they were small.&nbsp;

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:50.480
An interest in music begins small, but it's&nbsp;
practiced and it develops until eventually&nbsp;

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.840
you have someone like Mozart who's&nbsp;
writing concertos when he's six years old.&nbsp;

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:03.840
Everything which is large, even in one case I'm&nbsp;
remembering from past life cases, an ability with&nbsp;

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:11.840
guns, an ability to be very facile and very quick&nbsp;
draw came from a history of a former life of a&nbsp;

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:20.800
marshal on the frontier. That makes sense.&nbsp;
It also is grounds for hope because it means&nbsp;

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:26.320
not that we're a prisoner of our past, but we&nbsp;
operate within a context which has been shaped&nbsp;

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:34.880
by our past. Within that context, we make choices&nbsp;
which then feed into our future and our future&nbsp;

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:43.680
lives future. It's a very empowering position&nbsp;
because even though you may be temporarily&nbsp;

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:49.280
burdened if you are by something that's got a&nbsp;
deeper history, you have the power to change&nbsp;

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.360
your history. You have a power to exert your will&nbsp;
and exert your choices, make better choices or&nbsp;

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:04.640
stronger different choices and lead into a&nbsp;
better future. When you look at the world through&nbsp;

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.720
reincarnationist eyes, you&nbsp;
realize that everybody's playing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:14.720
a different game. They're not playing your
game. I think of it like school. There are some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.800
people who are in kindergarten and first grade,
some people who are in high school, some people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:25.680
are doing postgraduate work. That gives you
tremendous permission to let people be themselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.960
just to let them be because they're working on
their court, their rules that they're working on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.720
somebody else is working on a different court,
different rules. The idea that we all have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.920
get past the same finish line at the same time
in order for things to work out right, we all have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.320
to be saved before we die or something like this,
that doesn't make nearly as much sense as we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:53.280
developing flower garden. We are different types
of flowers which are developing and emerging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:53.280 --> 00:45:00.400
over large periods of time. We have an open-ended
amount of time with which to develop ourselves. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.600
tell my students sometimes the only important
question you should be asking yourself is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:13.680
what do you want to be doing in 10,000 years?
That's a simple question. Simple question, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:19.760
provoking, isn't it? Oh, well, I'm joking. It's
profound. Yeah. It's like, take the large&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.440
perspective, people. The creative intelligence
of the universe thinks large. It doesn't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:31.040
small, right? The greatest&nbsp;
thing about reincarnation&nbsp;

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:36.960
and the Hindus thought this was a burden. When&nbsp;
they discovered reincarnation, they thought,&nbsp;

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.360
oh my God, we go round and round and round. We&nbsp;
have to go through puberty all these times. We&nbsp;

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:46.080
have to go through the hardship of life over and&nbsp;
over and over again. They did not think it was a&nbsp;

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:53.760
joy. They thought it was a burden, but I think&nbsp;
we can appreciate that the greatest burden in the&nbsp;

00:45:53.760 --> 00:46:00.560
psyche of the modern man, modern humanity, is this&nbsp;
terrible idea that we are nothing more than our&nbsp;

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:07.920
biology. Everything mental condenses to physics&nbsp;
and that when the body dies, our mind disappears&nbsp;

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:15.440
and dissolves. We're nothing. There's no survival&nbsp;
of the body. Reincarnation puts the myth to that.&nbsp;

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:22.880
It shows us that we are developing over vast&nbsp;
tracts of time, and that allows us to elevate&nbsp;

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:30.480
our assessment of what the purpose of life&nbsp;
might be. If I give an in-class test a quiz,&nbsp;

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:37.440
I have a right to expect a certain set of&nbsp;
results. If I give them an hour-long test,&nbsp;

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.920
I expect more because I've given them more&nbsp;
time. If I give them a research paper,&nbsp;

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:48.160
I expect more because they have more time to&nbsp;
develop it. If the universe has a purpose,&nbsp;

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.360
if it has a purpose, it should be proportionate&nbsp;
to the amount of time we have to realize that&nbsp;

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.880
purpose. If we only have one lifetime, remember&nbsp;
for some people that's just five minutes before&nbsp;

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:06.480
they're dead out of the delivery room.&nbsp;
Sometimes it's five days. If life has a purpose,&nbsp;

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.280
it can't be greater than the amount of&nbsp;
time we have to realize that purpose.&nbsp;

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:17.120
With reincarnation, we learn that we&nbsp;
have open-ended infinite amount of time.&nbsp;

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.160
That doesn't cause us to be lazy. Anybody who&nbsp;
wants to say, oh, I'll just deal with it later,&nbsp;

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:27.920
they're stupid. They haven't really taken&nbsp;
into how hard it is to be working here.&nbsp;

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:35.440
But when we have open-ended amount of time, it&nbsp;
lifts the ceiling and it allows us to look at the&nbsp;

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.640
beautiful pictures that come from the Hubble&nbsp;
telescope, for example, pictures of our galaxies&nbsp;

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:47.440
and nebulas and the infinite depth of the&nbsp;
universe and to recognize that we aren't&nbsp;

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:56.480
just a little bitty short 100-year part player in&nbsp;
this drama. We are an ancient player in this drama&nbsp;

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:04.000
and it allows us to look at the magnificent&nbsp;
grandeur of a galaxy and recognize that we have&nbsp;

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:12.240
a meaningful part in this magnificent galaxy's&nbsp;
unfolding of intelligence on its planets, around&nbsp;

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:22.640
its suns. That changes everything, doesn't it?&nbsp;
What do you feel the purpose of our individual&nbsp;

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:31.840
karma is that contributes to the collective? What&nbsp;
are we reincarnating toward? Well, let me kind of&nbsp;

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:39.440
start with a general observation, then go to&nbsp;
the more specific observations. What are we&nbsp;

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:50.160
reincarnating toward? To me, the boundary between&nbsp;
individual and collective has been made poor so&nbsp;

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:59.360
many times that I see it as one living organism&nbsp;
with different kind of folks eye of light.&nbsp;

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:06.560
The individual is an individual but it's&nbsp;
contextualized within an individuality of&nbsp;

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.720
a species and our species&nbsp;
as a single consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.800
is an individual. I mean, its humanity on planet&nbsp;

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:20.320
Earth is different than some other species&nbsp;
on some other planet and some other galaxy.&nbsp;

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:27.440
The mind of our species, the collective psyche,&nbsp;
the memory of our species is unique in its history&nbsp;

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:35.200
and in its components. In our mind, we are part of&nbsp;
that. So my understanding is we live in a constant&nbsp;

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:41.600
dialogue, a constant transmission back and forth&nbsp;
between the collective and the individual to the&nbsp;

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:49.120
collective. So then we ask the question, okay,&nbsp;
what are we evolving toward? Where is it taking&nbsp;

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:58.000
us? And that gets us into very interesting&nbsp;
territory. Probably the large majority of&nbsp;

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:06.800
the answers that we would give that we are&nbsp;
evolving to love or to compassion or to&nbsp;

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:12.240
knowledge or something like this, inevitably&nbsp;
that probably is going to end up being too small&nbsp;

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:18.160
because we're going to formulate those goals&nbsp;
out of our particular moment in history and take&nbsp;

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:28.160
something good and project it forward. But ask&nbsp;
the same question in 5,000 years and we'd probably&nbsp;

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:35.280
give a different richer answer. So I think the&nbsp;
safest answers are in terms of process answers,&nbsp;

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:44.880
not in terms of goal answers. I tend to think&nbsp;
the essence of the whole process is growth&nbsp;

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:50.720
and empowerment of the nature that we have,&nbsp;
the empowerment of the form that we are.&nbsp;

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:56.160
Growth. Growth toward what? That comes the&nbsp;
tricky part. I mean, I would like to say&nbsp;

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:03.360
growth towards oneness, growth towards&nbsp;
love, growth towards wisdom, growth towards,&nbsp;

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:09.760
I mean, literally intelligence, more intelligence,&nbsp;
more aesthetic capacity, more creative capacity,&nbsp;

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:18.800
more communion between human intelligence and&nbsp;
spiritual intelligence. But those are just limited&nbsp;

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:24.720
intermediate baby steps, I think, but that there&nbsp;
is a progression towards growth I think we can&nbsp;

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:32.720
extract from the evolutionary record and also&nbsp;
a growth towards individuality. I think of&nbsp;

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:43.040
reincarnation as a higher octave of evolution.&nbsp;
Evolution evolves whole groups forward. It folds&nbsp;

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:49.680
learning forward of whole groups. Reincarnation&nbsp;
folds the learning forward of individuals within&nbsp;

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:56.000
certain species. Nature has somehow found&nbsp;
a way of kind of letting individuals run&nbsp;

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.320
forward in time. Where is it going to go?&nbsp;
Well, we've been doing it for hundreds of&nbsp;

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.920
thousands of years and the universe has been&nbsp;
evolving for 13.7 billion years and it's going&nbsp;

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:14.800
to continue for hundreds of billions of years yet.&nbsp;
Where are we going? I mean, what could we become&nbsp;

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:22.400
if we had 10,000 years to work with? We'll&nbsp;
become more. I think we'll become better.&nbsp;

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:28.960
We'll become more in tune with reality and I&nbsp;
deeply mean spiritual reality. We'll become&nbsp;

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:35.280
stronger because we'll be working together to&nbsp;
solve our problems instead of fighting over&nbsp;

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:46.000
a small plate of food. We'll become more. How&nbsp;
can people engage in the karmic and reincarnation&nbsp;

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.640
process more consciously? Because I imagine there&nbsp;
are those listening thinking, well, I have a&nbsp;

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:56.640
horrible lot in this lifetime. I don't want to be&nbsp;
here anymore. I'm never coming back here. In fact,&nbsp;

00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:02.720
some people truly believe that this is a prison&nbsp;
planet and it's run by dark forces that are trying&nbsp;

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:10.000
to control us or that do control us. Yeah, my&nbsp;
heart goes out to people who are suffering that&nbsp;

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:18.480
much pain. I mean, I know people who are suffering&nbsp;
that much pain and I think inevitably when we try&nbsp;

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:27.760
to understand what's going on, inevitably we kind&nbsp;
of project out of our own living circumstance.&nbsp;

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.360
So if we see ourselves living on a planet that's&nbsp;
a prison planet controlled by dark forces,&nbsp;

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:39.280
I mean, I can't help but think that there is a&nbsp;
projection of one's own psychological experience&nbsp;

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:46.560
into metaphysical parameters. And I can only&nbsp;
suggest that as you get clearer, as you go&nbsp;

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:53.840
through deepening your experience of your&nbsp;
own life through various spiritual practices&nbsp;

00:53:53.840 --> 00:54:00.400
and by living as good a life as we can live,&nbsp;
as fair and compassion, as just and compassion&nbsp;

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:12.720
and generous life as we can live, your mind gets&nbsp;
clearer. The forces that constrict your life&nbsp;

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:22.080
loosen and you begin to realize that all along,&nbsp;
you in very subtle and often mysterious ways,&nbsp;

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:29.120
you are controlling the flow of energy that&nbsp;
is your life. And if you've made choices that&nbsp;

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:34.400
have constricted that flow in the past, you&nbsp;
can reverse those choices in the present.&nbsp;

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:40.960
If you've had bad karma, constrictive, tight&nbsp;
karma in the past, you can choose, begin to choose&nbsp;

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:48.720
different generous karma, clear karma. And all&nbsp;
the spiritual traditions have procedures to help&nbsp;

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:56.080
you move into deeper clarity. The Buddhists&nbsp;
start with the four noble truths. They start&nbsp;

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.840
with the fundamental truths&nbsp;
of do no harm, do no injury,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.320
right speech, right conduct, so on so forth.&nbsp;

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:08.320
Every religion has these commandments, if you&nbsp;
will, these guidelines, how to clear your mind,&nbsp;

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:14.640
how to clear your mind, how to clear your heart.&nbsp;
As you clear your mind and clear your heart,&nbsp;

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:21.920
a different picture of the universe emerges,&nbsp;
one which is not governed by dark forces,&nbsp;

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:28.240
though clearly if you look at certain political&nbsp;
movements and certain social movements and&nbsp;

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.400
movements of war and whatnot, there's a lot of&nbsp;
darkness and there's a lot of oppressive forces&nbsp;

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:40.240
and there's a lot of greed and negativity in&nbsp;
there. But your experience of the universe itself&nbsp;

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:51.760
changes. It opens into a divine banquet,&nbsp;
a wonderful mystery, but a divine banquet.&nbsp;

00:55:51.760 --> 00:56:00.400
And how do I connect with that? I mean, how do&nbsp;
I begin to change my life so that I can begin to&nbsp;

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:06.640
have that kind of experience or I can feel that&nbsp;
affinity with the fellow human beings who are&nbsp;

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:17.680
traveling with me? This is kind of like basic&nbsp;
spirituality 101. So anything which you do which&nbsp;

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:22.640
favors yourself over someone else, stop doing&nbsp;
that. Everything you do which hurts other&nbsp;

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.440
people around you, stop doing that. Every&nbsp;
time you injure someone with your speech,&nbsp;

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:32.400
stop doing that. And just the whole&nbsp;
system slowly begins to calm down.&nbsp;

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:38.640
And then there are other techniques which teach&nbsp;
you how to bring your mind underneath all the&nbsp;

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.760
turbulence that's on the&nbsp;
surface. And we can just start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:47.520
to live a lifestyle which is calmer, quieter,
more peaceful. It doesn't mean we're not in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:51.040
world. We're in the world. We're making a living.
We're doing our jobs. We have to deal with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:57.840
everything everybody else does. But you can
engage it in a different way. And as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:04.880
individually come into greater clarity,
I think crystallizing around you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:12.320
be opportunities of greater growth around you.
We are not trapped by our karma. Karma is simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:20.560
a platform. We can reach beyond our past and to
create a future, which may still have its own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:25.440
challenges, but it'll be&nbsp;
clearer, it'll be gentler,&nbsp;

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:32.000
more exciting. Can you share a little bit more&nbsp;
about your understanding of karma? Because some&nbsp;

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.320
people listening might be thinking, well, it's&nbsp;
simply cause and effect, or maybe even a form of&nbsp;

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:47.040
punishment. Not punishment, but certainly cause&nbsp;
and effect. In Hindi terms, it's karma-vipaka,&nbsp;

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:53.360
cause and effect. And so the basic idea is this.&nbsp;
We live in an entire universe of cause and effect.&nbsp;

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:58.560
Everything has cause. Everything has effects.&nbsp;
Everything. There's not a single part of this&nbsp;

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.600
universe which doesn't have&nbsp;
cause and effect except the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:06.800
fundamental ground state. It's all cause and
effect. So we don't have any problem with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.760
in the scientific world. We recognize molecules,
atoms, movement of things, they have cause and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:18.560
effect. No problem. Now that we get to the nub
of it, the Hindus would say, and ancient&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:23.280
traditions would say, choice&nbsp;
has cause and effect. The&nbsp;

00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:30.080
choices we make, which is to say we are learning&nbsp;
systems. We are constantly learning. And when we&nbsp;

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:37.680
make a choice, we are basically setting in motion&nbsp;
a trajectory of learning. When we make a choice to&nbsp;

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:45.440
push away something or to include something, to&nbsp;
hurt or to support, we are always making choices.&nbsp;

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:52.080
Those choices basically echo back around and&nbsp;
become part of our subsequent experiences.&nbsp;

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:59.280
One of the easiest ways to describe some of the&nbsp;
logic of this, when people talk about good karma&nbsp;

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:07.440
and bad karma inheriting the consequences&nbsp;
of… technically it's the good vipaka that&nbsp;

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.640
comes from good action, the bad vipaka&nbsp;
that comes from bad action, bad karma.&nbsp;

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:20.720
When we are experiencing these cycles, what's&nbsp;
at the center of it is giving the human being&nbsp;

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:27.040
incredible power to control their destiny. They&nbsp;
may not be able to control it in the short term&nbsp;

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:32.960
because there's so much momentum in the&nbsp;
system. But if you begin to systematically&nbsp;

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:40.080
engage the momentum of the causal forces powering,&nbsp;
pushing your life, you can begin making clearer&nbsp;

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:45.360
and clearer and clearer choices. And as you begin&nbsp;
making clearer choices, your inner environment&nbsp;

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:52.400
becomes clearer and your outer environment begins&nbsp;
to become clearer. For Hinduism, this would be&nbsp;

00:59:52.400 --> 01:00:00.160
simple Dharma 101. This is just kind of how life&nbsp;
works. We are here to grow. We are here to learn.&nbsp;

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:06.720
An academic transcript is a history of grades&nbsp;
in various courses. You could say it's karma.&nbsp;

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.080
You make choices. You make&nbsp;
choices to pay attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.880
not to pay attention, to apply yourself,
not to apply yourself. You make choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.000
The cumulative effect of all those choices
is your transcript at the end of college.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.480
It's like that in life. We're&nbsp;
making choices constantly.&nbsp;

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:32.160
There's nothing magical or infamous about karma.&nbsp;
It's just reminding us that not only does the&nbsp;

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:39.600
physical world move according to cause and effect,&nbsp;
but our psychological world also moves according&nbsp;

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:47.600
to cause and effect, and our spiritual world does&nbsp;
too, except that there is a depth in the spiritual&nbsp;

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.440
level. There may be also in&nbsp;
the quantum level as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:57.920
but there is a depth in the physical level
which you discover deep inside your center&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.640
that is not part of cause and&nbsp;
effect. It's outside of cause&nbsp;

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:11.200
and effect. The spiritual traditions make a great&nbsp;
deal of emphasis of reducing the turbulence of&nbsp;

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:19.040
karma, cause and effect, until one can actually&nbsp;
experience the aspect of your own being which is&nbsp;

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:27.600
free of cause and effect. When they describe&nbsp;
one's essential nature, one's divine nature,&nbsp;

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:34.160
it never begins, it never ends. It doesn't&nbsp;
have a beginning and end. It's always present.&nbsp;

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:40.400
It's always stable. Karma has beginning and end.&nbsp;
It runs around, does all sorts, like a playground,&nbsp;

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.040
but underneath there is this reality&nbsp;
which has neither beginning nor end.&nbsp;

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:53.840
Spiritual practice is about living more of your&nbsp;
life from that reality rather than living your&nbsp;

01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:02.640
life from that turbulence, cause and effect. What&nbsp;
role do historical traumas and collective traumas&nbsp;

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:07.920
play in what we're experiencing here on earth? Of&nbsp;
course, I know you mentioned earlier there's a lot&nbsp;

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:17.280
of pleasant attributes we bring with us as well.&nbsp;
All the virtues of history are poured into us,&nbsp;

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:24.400
that surround us, as well as all the burdens of&nbsp;
bad choices of history, all the sins of history.&nbsp;

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:31.600
We seem to be in a very intense time now. We're&nbsp;
coming into a critical time in human history.&nbsp;

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:39.440
We've never been here before. We've had
pieces of continents in danger, but now we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:47.120
have an entire planet that's in danger of becoming
unable to sustain our population. And we're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.320
it. It's human-made. We're making the choices.
We're causing the problem. Nature is not causing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:52.320 --> 01:03:00.320
the problem. We are causing the problem.
And so, we seem to be in a time of increasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:07.120
turbulence, disruption, chaos. We're dealing
with a lot of social uncertainty and social&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:14.400
divisiveness because many people are not clear
how to face the challenges that were coming into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.360
us as species. We know that global climate change
is going to have enormous impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:24.880
We're going to be losing many,&nbsp;
many, many lives in the near future,&nbsp;

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:36.160
in the future. And this leads to uncertainty and&nbsp;
a lot of turbulence. And if we look at this same&nbsp;

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:44.400
situation from within a deep spiritual perspective&nbsp;
and we ask, what is causing this inner turbulence?&nbsp;

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.560
Well, in some ways, I look towards&nbsp;
the lives of individual mystics.&nbsp;

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:57.280
When we look at the life of an individual&nbsp;
mystic, this is well documented and testified&nbsp;

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.080
that before the breakthrough of enlightenment,&nbsp;
before the breakthrough of the universal&nbsp;

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:07.760
one heart, we go through the dark night of&nbsp;
the soul. We go through a period of deep,&nbsp;

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:13.760
deep, intense personal cleansing. And another&nbsp;
way of thinking about this from a reincarnational&nbsp;

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:20.000
perspective is that we're cleaning the basement.&nbsp;
All the things inside of us which are incompatible&nbsp;

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000
with enlightenment, all the history which has&nbsp;
led us to have convictions and urges and whatnot,&nbsp;

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:32.800
which are incompatible with universal love,&nbsp;
are being forced out of the system. And in your&nbsp;

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:40.800
meditation, the spiritual practitioners can&nbsp;
experience that. They experience upheavals&nbsp;

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.560
coming up from within them. Sometimes they're&nbsp;
crying on the meditation cushion. Sometimes&nbsp;

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:52.800
they're feeling unspeakable rage, but the advice&nbsp;
is always the same. Keep centered, let it flow&nbsp;

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:59.840
through you. It will pass. It will move through&nbsp;
you. If we kind of think of the entire species&nbsp;

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:06.320
as a single meditating being, I think something&nbsp;
like this is happening. I personally think we&nbsp;

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:16.880
are entering into a profoundly important, very&nbsp;
positive turning point in human evolution,&nbsp;

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.880
which will take us into a&nbsp;
higher level of psycho-spiritual&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:27.920
functioning at an across-the-board
platform. For us to actualize this, for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:34.800
us to realize this, we have to clear ourselves of
everything which is keeping us from experiencing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:40.400
this state right here, right now, today.
And the things which are keeping us from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:46.240
experiencing this is all our collective
karma and collective history and all our cultural&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:52.000
institutions and the history that each of us
carry individually and we all carry collectively&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:59.200
together. So I think that we are actually
experiencing a time of tremendous purification.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.760
It's kind of like you have to expose the shadow
before you can heal the shadow. And we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.240
are certainly exposing the&nbsp;
shadow of humanity right now&nbsp;

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:20.160
in many of the very destructive and self-absorbed&nbsp;
and injurious policies or practices that are&nbsp;

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:27.440
arising in our midst. I think of this as kind of a&nbsp;
collective purification, which is part and parcel&nbsp;

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:34.720
of leading into a spiritual awakening,&nbsp;
the deep and profound spiritual awakening.&nbsp;

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:44.080
Yes, Carl Jung and the shadow, focusing&nbsp;
on our own individual shadow selves or&nbsp;

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:54.800
letting ourselves maybe heal from what ails us.&nbsp;
What would you suggest people consider doing&nbsp;

01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:04.640
as far as do they primarily focus on their own&nbsp;
selves and or assisting the collective? I mean,&nbsp;

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.280
I understand what you're saying that as we focus&nbsp;
on ourselves, we're part of the collective.&nbsp;

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:17.280
It's a both-hand situation, isn't it? Because&nbsp;
while an enlightened individual in a monastery,&nbsp;

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:23.120
in a mountain with no contact in the world&nbsp;
may have an uplifting effect on the whole,&nbsp;

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:31.920
that person has that reality. Most of us live&nbsp;
embodied in the world, and we would like to do&nbsp;

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:39.680
more than have a meditative effect, uplifting the&nbsp;
collective from the ground. We would like to do&nbsp;

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.560
something practical. I mean, we'd like to help&nbsp;
the world be a better place, leave it a better&nbsp;

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:50.560
place before we die. We'd like to sort of help&nbsp;
people in need or help to solve the problems that&nbsp;

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:58.960
are endemic to our culture. If we do that or&nbsp;
try to do that without deep inner clarity,&nbsp;

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:06.720
we may get some success, but we'll also leave more&nbsp;
damage behind too. So I think it's a both-hand&nbsp;

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:14.000
becoming socially active to work for social&nbsp;
clarity, social peace, and to be personally,&nbsp;

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:22.560
inwardly clear and at peace with oneself. I did&nbsp;
this years and years of psychedelic practice and&nbsp;

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:29.200
other spiritual practices that time, but I was&nbsp;
always working as an academic. I was working hard&nbsp;

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:37.200
at an open enrollment university and trying to&nbsp;
raise that corner. That was my garden. That was&nbsp;

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.280
where I worked and where I was trying to make&nbsp;
things better. And all of my colleagues, they&nbsp;

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.400
had their gardens. They were working to make&nbsp;
things better in the world. And so I don't think&nbsp;

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.720
it's an either or. I think some people&nbsp;
are drawn more to this incarnation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.040
to an individual interior&nbsp;

01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:01.920
project. Other people are drawn&nbsp;
more to an exterior social project.&nbsp;

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.280
There's not a right or wrong&nbsp;
here. I think it's both-and.&nbsp;

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.680
What would you like to say to someone&nbsp;
who may be listening, thinking,&nbsp;

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:15.840
well, I'm doing my part, but that person or&nbsp;
that group or that institution or that country&nbsp;

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.800
is really messing things&nbsp;
up and they're the problem?&nbsp;

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.160
Yeah. And they may be. And there are&nbsp;
certainly people, other players in the world,&nbsp;

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:32.160
besides ourselves, and they're doing bad things&nbsp;
in the world. Any right-thinking person would&nbsp;

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.520
want to try to mitigate those bad things. If&nbsp;
we see someone beating a child, naturally,&nbsp;

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:44.640
we try to intervene, to stop without&nbsp;
thinking. We do it to protect the child.&nbsp;

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:52.160
But at a deeper level, a more philosophical&nbsp;
level, one of the things that comes with the&nbsp;

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.680
reincarnational worldview and understanding the&nbsp;
deep, deep forces that guide people's lives and&nbsp;

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:06.720
set up circumstances is it's an absolute waste of&nbsp;
time to be envious of someone else's good fortune.&nbsp;

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:13.360
You should never judge someone else's bad&nbsp;
fortune. We don't know what got them there.&nbsp;

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:19.040
We don't know whether this is a saint or a sinner.&nbsp;
It could be a sinner inheriting bad karma or it&nbsp;

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:26.240
could be a saint who's taken on somebody else's&nbsp;
bad karma. We don't know. Best to take care of&nbsp;

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:32.800
your own shop. Best to do the very, very best&nbsp;
you can with the circumstances in which you find&nbsp;

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.760
yourselves in because there's&nbsp;
meaning and intention in those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:42.160
circumstances. Engage that part of the
outside world which is yours to engage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.800
A lot of it is recognizing&nbsp;
that people are at different&nbsp;

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:56.560
stages of their life, their soul's life, and we&nbsp;
have to stand the ground that we need to stand&nbsp;

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:01.280
but most of our judgments aren't about standing&nbsp;
ground. It's just being judgmental in the way&nbsp;

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.800
that creates more barriers that only have to&nbsp;
be taken down later. Judgments are barriers.&nbsp;

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.920
There's a way in which we can draw conclusions&nbsp;
but without living within the harsh boundaries&nbsp;

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:25.360
of judgments. Do you feel we're going&nbsp;
through a collective near-death experience&nbsp;

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.360
even though we don't really die since&nbsp;
our consciousness seems to continue?&nbsp;

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:38.240
Yeah. I think we are going through something like&nbsp;
that. What happens when people have a near fatal&nbsp;

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:47.760
accident and we know that when their mind speeds&nbsp;
up, they become able to do physical things that&nbsp;

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.280
they would never have dreamed that they could do.&nbsp;
If they're falling off a mountain, they can take&nbsp;

01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:00.800
action along the way. The mind speeds up and often&nbsp;
the heart opens, the mind opens. One enters into&nbsp;

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:11.120
transcendent spaces under the pressure of almost&nbsp;
dying. Now, it's not being alarmist to say that&nbsp;

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:18.240
we are going into a near extinction event on&nbsp;
this planet. The crises which have only now just&nbsp;

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.600
beginning to start are going to be getting worse&nbsp;
and everything we're doing in this country,&nbsp;

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:29.600
I'm afraid, politically is going to make that&nbsp;
crisis, that confrontation with the planet's&nbsp;

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:40.000
limits even harder and more severe. Clearly, we're&nbsp;
going into very, very difficult and challenging&nbsp;

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.840
times and there are some very smart people, good&nbsp;
clear-thinking people who basically have concluded&nbsp;

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.600
that's it. Humanity is toast. We're living&nbsp;
on extended time. There's no reversing this&nbsp;

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.040
process. We're going to go extinct. We're&nbsp;
going to die. We just don't know it yet.&nbsp;

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.240
But if you look at the statistics, you look&nbsp;
at the information, you look at the patterns,&nbsp;

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:11.280
we're going extinct. I personally don't think&nbsp;
we are going extinct, but I don't believe that&nbsp;

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.800
like on rational calculus grounds. I believe it&nbsp;
because of my spiritual experiences that we do&nbsp;

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:23.680
make it through this crisis. But it clearly is&nbsp;
going to be a planet-changing crisis. It's going&nbsp;

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:29.360
to be a civilization-changing crisis. It's going&nbsp;
to be a near-death experience of our culture,&nbsp;

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:35.600
of our life on this planet. And we might learn&nbsp;
something about what might happen during it&nbsp;

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.040
if we study people, individuals who have had&nbsp;
near-death experiences. So I think we are,&nbsp;

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:47.120
I think things are speeding up. I think things&nbsp;
are becoming dire. I think there are fewer and&nbsp;

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:54.080
fewer innocent decisions. Every decision has&nbsp;
infinite ramifications. I think we're coming&nbsp;

01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:01.520
into a make or break point. We're coming into&nbsp;
a point of grow up or die. And the threat of&nbsp;

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:05.440
extinction is a tremendous&nbsp;
evolutionary accelerator.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.360
And I think we're coming into a time where we're
beginning to realize that if we don't change our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:20.560
practices, we're going to lose our life on this
planet. And that core deep down inside, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:27.120
transformation that's required is not simply
a transformation of politics or economics&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:34.400
or industrial production or agricultural.
It's not that primarily. It is fundamentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:41.040
a crisis of consciousness. It is the structure
of human consciousness that has gotten us&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:48.880
into this mess. It's the limitations of ego,
the loneliness, the self-centeredness of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:55.360
so-called cut-off ego that has led us into
these dead-end scenarios of just consuming&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:03.120
more and more and more, but not experience any
satisfaction that really gives us any deep, true&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.760
psychospiritual nourishment. We either make it
through this crisis or we go extinct.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.680
I personally, because that's&nbsp;
the visions I've been given,&nbsp;

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:18.720
I think we make it through. My concern is&nbsp;
how many of our children and grandchildren&nbsp;

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:25.760
and great-grandchildren are going to die before&nbsp;
we make it through. That's my major concern.&nbsp;

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:34.160
There may be those listening, thinking,&nbsp;
well, if there is this oceanic&nbsp;

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:39.360
wave of love and oneness, why does&nbsp;
it have to get so bad or hard?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.840
Why do we have to get to this point?
Why do we have to suffer so much? Why does&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:53.840
there have to be pain and suffering and people
being treated poorly and dying a bodily death&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.400
when maybe they didn't otherwise have to?
Yeah. Boy, that's a hard question. You're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.840
asking hard questions today.
Because you're basically asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.240
the question, why is there suffering?
If there is intelligence and wisdom&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.760
and love as a starting point of&nbsp;
creation, why is it so damn hard?&nbsp;

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:22.080
Why do we suffer so much? Why didn't somebody give&nbsp;
us an instruction manual to help us do better?&nbsp;

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:29.440
Why is it so hard? We get angry at the divine&nbsp;
intelligence and we think we could do it better.&nbsp;

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.200
If I were doing this universe, I could design&nbsp;
a better universe. There wouldn't be as much&nbsp;

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:39.120
suffering. We'd do it differently.&nbsp;
But all of that assumes that we know&nbsp;

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:47.040
what is being built. We judge from the context of&nbsp;
our own historical position and we make judgments&nbsp;

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:53.520
about what a good humanity would look like or what&nbsp;
a spiritually realized humanity would look like&nbsp;

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:59.120
or just what a peaceful humanity would look&nbsp;
like. And this is how we could build toward that.&nbsp;

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.520
But maybe we're not building toward&nbsp;
that. Maybe we're building through that.&nbsp;

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.880
Clearly, the creative intelligence thinks on a&nbsp;
huge landscape. When you really just meditate&nbsp;

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:18.000
on what astrophysics has taught us and astronomy&nbsp;
has taught us, the landscape of creation is vast&nbsp;

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:26.000
and magnificent. So we have to genuinely ask&nbsp;
ourselves, okay, what is this intelligence&nbsp;

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.720
creating in this species? What is the project?&nbsp;
Where are we going? What might we become?&nbsp;

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:42.720
And if we expand in even lightly 100,000&nbsp;
years, which is a second in cosmic time,&nbsp;

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:48.720
even if we imagine what would be the best&nbsp;
that we could become in 100,000 years,&nbsp;

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:57.840
we might begin to understand where suffering&nbsp;
fits into this larger agenda, which is larger&nbsp;

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.560
than most of our agenda. Most of us would think&nbsp;
if we could just get comfortable and be a happy&nbsp;

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:08.800
human being as we are and live, eat, and die,&nbsp;
we'd be okay. But maybe that's not the agenda&nbsp;

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:15.920
of existence at all, of the creative intelligence.&nbsp;
And I don't mean to treat people suffering&nbsp;

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:25.120
cavalierly. I truly do not mean so. I mean, it's&nbsp;
all great respect to those who suffer, honestly.&nbsp;

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:31.840
But suffering in some ways in our time is like&nbsp;
when we're building a house and we have the walls&nbsp;

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:37.520
up, the stud walls up, and we have the trusses up&nbsp;
that we haven't put on the roof. And if it rains,&nbsp;

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.720
rain comes in. It's because&nbsp;
the house is unfinished.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.560
It's not because there's any structural
design flaw in the house. The house is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:52.880
not finished. Humanity is an unfinished species.
Sri Aurobindo made a large point of this. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.360
talked about how humanity&nbsp;
is a transitional species.&nbsp;

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:03.360
We are transitioning from what we were 100,000&nbsp;
years ago into what we are in the process of&nbsp;

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:10.640
becoming deep. We are not the end of the project.&nbsp;
We are just in the middle of the project.&nbsp;

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:18.400
In that context, if we take disease, for&nbsp;
example, we are only at the early stages&nbsp;

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:25.760
of developing our consciousness so clearly and&nbsp;
strongly that we can heal diseases in our body&nbsp;

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:33.520
with our minds. We know psychoneuroimmunology has&nbsp;
shown us this, but I'm talking about the serious&nbsp;

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:40.880
diseases that seem so resistant to this subtle&nbsp;
manipulation. We are just getting started in&nbsp;

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:47.840
basically exploring the potential of our&nbsp;
consciousness to keep this system healthy&nbsp;

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:57.040
and strong. And some of the suffering of disease,&nbsp;
it's just an unfinished business. We haven't&nbsp;

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.840
gotten to the point where we can control&nbsp;
ourselves that much. Our knowledge has not&nbsp;

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:07.600
expanded yet to be able to supplement what we&nbsp;
can do with our mind. There's just so much which&nbsp;

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:15.600
is unfinished. So before we kind of take over&nbsp;
control and blame God for doing such a mess up,&nbsp;

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.440
we might examine our own assumptions of what the&nbsp;
purpose of the project is, what the goal of the&nbsp;

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:27.360
project is. Because you're&nbsp;
a man of deep philosophy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.320
religious and spiritual studies, I know you
mentioned this in your book, in our previous&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:39.840
conversation, and since you brought up God,
can you briefly mention your relationship to that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:46.640
term? I was raised in a Catholic tradition. I was
studying to be a priest in the early years for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:55.040
four years. I have learned a lot in watching
religions coming to existence. And in some ways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:02.560
dogma is kind of like sausage. You never want to
see one being made because it may look good on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:08.880
the outside, but boy, a whole lot of personality
gets involved in the forging of dogma in history.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:16.080
So it's a sobering experience to truly watch how
religions come into existence. And so I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:22.000
learned just from the study of history that
one of the most dangerous things that a human&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:32.880
being can say is, I know what God wants you to do.
You should do this. And there are so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:38.640
limitations, cultural limitations, historical
limitations that are built into God vocabulary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:45.440
into the God language, that I prefer not to use
that term. And I would talk about the divine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:54.720
but even the divine is superloaded with historical
associations. And so in the title of my book on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:58.800
psychedelic work is LSD And&nbsp;
The Mind of the Universe.&nbsp;

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:08.400
And I chose not to kind of concretize that with&nbsp;
an image of divinity because I see those images of&nbsp;

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:15.840
divinity as so historically conditioned that they&nbsp;
weren't large enough to envision what I was trying&nbsp;

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:22.800
to describe. Now we have a sense of how vast the&nbsp;
universe is. We count its distance in light years,&nbsp;

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:28.640
and each light year is six million, million&nbsp;
miles, and we count it in terms of multiple&nbsp;

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:37.120
thousands of light years. And then to imagine&nbsp;
that there is a mind which is as large as this&nbsp;

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.280
universe is large, and then to&nbsp;
try to fathom what that mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:50.000
might be like, and then to take a journey
in which you self-initiate into the edges of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:59.920
that vast, expensive mind, several things kind of
happen or less happen to me. One is that I fell&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:07.840
in love. I fell in love with this reality. Once
you experience it in its clarity, it's so powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:18.640
and so magnificent and so beautiful that I call it
my beloved. It is a love relationship with life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:26.640
with this deeper intelligence embedded in life.
Now I sometimes talk about the divine, as I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:32.880
here, and sometimes I'll even talk about God.
If I feel that the context is clear,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:36.720
that I'm not using those terms&nbsp;
in their conventional references,&nbsp;

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.200
but I'm using to point to what those terms point&nbsp;
to, ideally, this infinitely large horizon,&nbsp;

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:49.680
this expansive beauty, this knowledge, this&nbsp;
genius. We're talking about cosmic genius&nbsp;

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:58.560
in this universe. The hardest thing that I&nbsp;
found in negotiating all of my psychedelic work&nbsp;

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:05.360
was not what happened in that journey during&nbsp;
the sessions. The hardest part came when I&nbsp;

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:11.200
ended that journey and everything was fine.&nbsp;
Everything was good. There was no trauma.&nbsp;

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:19.680
I had been given many, many gifts of intimacy&nbsp;
with the divine, but then when I withdrew and I&nbsp;

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:25.440
stepped out of it and I was no longer making&nbsp;
contact, experiential contact with that deeper&nbsp;

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:34.800
reality for reasons that I explained in the book,&nbsp;
it was the loss of contact with my beloved, even&nbsp;

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.320
though I knew the beloved was&nbsp;
always here. I knew that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:45.200
was only my own blinders which were keeping
me from experiencing it. I knew it was always the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:51.920
warp and woof of reality that I was embedded in,
but the intensity of being dissolved into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:51.920 --> 01:25:02.960
body of light that is the underlying light of the
universe, it caused such a deep sadness, a deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.360
withdrawal. It was very difficult and it really
took me about 10 years after I stopped my sessions&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:18.480
to really get fully grounded and committed to
living in this earth on its terms again. I give&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.960
you that anecdote just to say that my journey into
the divine had many stages and many layers over&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:34.640
many years. I would not trade any of those days
for any treasures on earth and learning how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:42.320
to live without the constant immersion or the
repetitive immersion into those treasures has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:50.800
a real learning exercise for me that it continues.
Yeah. Chris, how do you suggest or what do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:50.800 --> 01:26:00.560
you recommend are ways that people can
explore themselves, get in touch with the deeper&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:10.320
creative intelligence inside of them to be able to
move that karmic part of them forward? Are there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:17.360
any particular practices that are maybe outside
or part of psychedelics that can assist people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:24.320
listening? There's so many practices because what
we're talking about is spirituality and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.640
Christians have an approach to spirituality,
the Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.280
an approach to spirituality&nbsp;
with a lot of common ground,&nbsp;

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.720
but it's no secret and now we live in a time in&nbsp;
history where these previously secret teachings&nbsp;

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:46.640
are now available on every street corner. You&nbsp;
know, after China invaded Tibet, lineage holders&nbsp;

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:52.000
of this tremendous ancient spiritual lineage&nbsp;
have now flooded into the Western countries&nbsp;

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.120
and we have centers throughout the United States&nbsp;
and Europe. We're talking about basic spiritual&nbsp;

01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.800
practices. We're also talking about maybe&nbsp;
psychotherapeutic practices. We're basically&nbsp;

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.800
using a psychotherapeutic approach to heal&nbsp;
some of the surface wounds of the heart.&nbsp;

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:16.080
My first sitter was my wife, Carol,&nbsp;
and she's a clinical psychologist and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.800
she never did a psychedelic
session. It wasn't her cup&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.280
of tea. She really found everything&nbsp;
she needed on her meditation cushion.&nbsp;

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.880
And just to clarify, by sitter you mean the&nbsp;
person who was with you during your LSD sessions?&nbsp;

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:34.720
Yeah, she was my sitter and holding the fort&nbsp;
while I was in my LSD sessions and she was&nbsp;

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:43.200
managing them with music and whatnot.&nbsp;
She never wanted to do a session herself.&nbsp;

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:48.560
She has subsequently gone on to complete&nbsp;
her three-year, three-month, three-day&nbsp;

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:55.360
solar retreat in the Vajrayana tradition.&nbsp;
She's been made and recognized as a lama&nbsp;

01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:04.800
within her community and she has a very,&nbsp;
very rich interior life. We're friends&nbsp;

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:13.360
and it didn't involve psychedelics at all. So&nbsp;
there's so many lineages of spiritual teachings.&nbsp;

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:19.920
There's Celtic lineages, so many Native American&nbsp;
lineages, there's South American lineages, there's&nbsp;

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.560
the ayahuasca traditions, there are some&nbsp;
psychedelic shamanic traditions that are&nbsp;

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:31.280
entering our country strongly now. There are&nbsp;
everyday wisdom traditions that are available&nbsp;

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:38.800
in abundance at any bookstore, at any airport.&nbsp;
Sounds true. And this program is an example of&nbsp;

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:46.160
inner teachings being made publicly available.&nbsp;
Even if I started a list, it would be just a&nbsp;

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:52.720
fraction of what's really available. We&nbsp;
can find the practices that can help us&nbsp;

01:28:52.720 --> 01:29:00.880
live a calmer, quieter, more centered, richer&nbsp;
life. Those are available and the practices which&nbsp;

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:08.800
are taught are pretty much the same. First,&nbsp;
kindness, non-injury, simplicity, voluntary&nbsp;

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:17.280
simplicity, centering stillness, social&nbsp;
kindness, social being good to people.&nbsp;

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:24.960
And it's a long road and it's not a road which&nbsp;
is going to be traveled in any one lifetime.&nbsp;

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:29.360
And so this is a road that's going&nbsp;
to be traveled over many lifetimes,&nbsp;

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.960
but every lifetime can get&nbsp;
better than the life before&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:38.480
it. We've also touched on the shadow part
and in addition and kind of building on what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:47.520
you just shared, how much of a role does
having a good time, joy, love, following&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:56.320
your own bliss or creativity play a role in
a person's karma and reincarnation? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:02.400
it certainly does. I mean, it's just part of the
fabric. I think because we learn about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:06.400
reincarnation from reading&nbsp;
the books from therapists,&nbsp;

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:11.600
we have a tendency to cast the thinking&nbsp;
about reincarnation in a negative light&nbsp;

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:20.000
because people go to therapists who are in&nbsp;
pain. But if you are an exceptionally brilliant,&nbsp;

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:28.640
creative composer, you can explore that dimension&nbsp;
of your life and find and trace the roots of your&nbsp;

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.400
love of music. And you'll find that it&nbsp;
goes deeper than this present lifetime.&nbsp;

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:43.360
All of our past gives us all of our virtues&nbsp;
and all of our vices. And we honor existence by&nbsp;

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:50.560
accepting the virtues, building on them, and&nbsp;
then working to reduce the vices, to unlock them&nbsp;

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:57.920
and let them go. What role does&nbsp;
self-love play in this process?&nbsp;

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:05.520
How can you love the world if you don't love&nbsp;
yourself? It's one of the things that came&nbsp;

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:12.080
real clear in some of my teachings that if&nbsp;
you're going to become one with the God,&nbsp;

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:17.440
if you're going to become one with all of&nbsp;
life, you must become one with yourself.&nbsp;

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:25.120
And therefore, when you try to become&nbsp;
one with God and one with the universe,&nbsp;

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:30.880
everything which is incompatible with becoming&nbsp;
one with yourself is forced to the surface.&nbsp;

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:38.560
So all of your injuries, all of your trauma,&nbsp;
all of your self-defeating habits and behaviors,&nbsp;

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:43.760
these are all shoved to the surface&nbsp;
right inside you, right in front of you.&nbsp;

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:52.880
So self-love, self-acceptance is absolutely&nbsp;
critical, but not superficial self-love.&nbsp;

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:59.200
Real deep self-love, love that's willing to take&nbsp;
on the shadow, love which is willing to love that&nbsp;

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:06.000
shadow until that shadow becomes a baby in your&nbsp;
arms and you take care of it and nurture it.&nbsp;

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.800
You know, the deep love, really deep, the&nbsp;
type of love a mother has for her child,&nbsp;

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:16.000
that love is the type of love we have to&nbsp;
have for ourselves and so we can handle,&nbsp;

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.840
we can clean anything that&nbsp;
needs to be cleaned in it.&nbsp;

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:23.840
Unconditional love and unconditional acceptance.&nbsp;

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:35.520
And love covers a multitude of sins.
Well, let's say it compensates, doesn't it?&nbsp;

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:40.160
Chris, you've shared so much today about&nbsp;
collective karma and reincarnation,&nbsp;

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:46.400
and I know we're going to have another&nbsp;
conversation about the birth of a future human&nbsp;

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:52.480
that you discovered in your LSD sessions, and&nbsp;
I'm wondering if you want to just touch on that&nbsp;

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:58.480
a little bit to prime us for our next&nbsp;
conversation and what that's about.&nbsp;

01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:06.320
I'd love to. One of the surprises for me in&nbsp;
my psychedelic work, because I began this work&nbsp;

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:11.920
adopting a model of transformation, the model&nbsp;
of personal transformation, which is pretty&nbsp;

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:16.800
widespread in the transpersonal community,&nbsp;
that when you do these practices, it's about&nbsp;

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:22.240
personal transformation, personal awakening,&nbsp;
personal healing, personal enlightenment.&nbsp;

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:28.640
And one of the surprises for&nbsp;
me has been how much of my work&nbsp;

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.800
didn't seem to be about me personally at all.&nbsp;
It was about collective, and it was collective&nbsp;

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:42.160
dynamics, and my love for myself expanded to&nbsp;
embrace the love of my people and the love of&nbsp;

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:48.800
my planet and the love of all the beings on the&nbsp;
planet. So it just wasn't about me personally.&nbsp;

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:56.880
As that deepened over the years, I began&nbsp;
to be initiated into a series of visions&nbsp;

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:03.920
where it was not about my spiritual evolution,&nbsp;
it was about the spiritual evolution of humanity,&nbsp;

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:12.880
where humanity was going. And I just want to&nbsp;
emphasize this is an utterly natural phenomenon.&nbsp;

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:18.800
Our individual mind, when we relax the boundaries&nbsp;
of our individual mind, our consciousness opens&nbsp;

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:24.080
and deep into our personal unconscious. But&nbsp;
as you keep clearing and you keep relaxing,&nbsp;

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:30.560
it opens up into this underlying field that&nbsp;
Jung called the collective psyche. And it's just&nbsp;

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:36.560
natural that when you go deeper into that&nbsp;
collective psyche and even pushing through it&nbsp;

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:44.880
to the matrix underneath that, that you inherit&nbsp;
insights into what's going on in the life of this&nbsp;

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:52.880
being. We count our lives in years, it counts&nbsp;
its life in millennia. So it opens up naturally.&nbsp;

01:34:52.880 --> 01:35:02.960
And I began to have insights of humanity poised&nbsp;
on the edge of a global death and rebirth process,&nbsp;

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.320
that what I had experienced as death and rebirth&nbsp;
and what every meditator experiences in terms of&nbsp;

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:14.720
death and rebirth on the meditation cushion, that&nbsp;
there was actually now fermenting within history&nbsp;

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:22.080
a death and rebirth dynamic that was so large,&nbsp;
so powerful, it was carrying all of humanity&nbsp;

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:30.640
in its grip. This was a surprise, an absolute&nbsp;
surprise to me, but it led me to have a certain&nbsp;

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:38.960
understanding that the project of history at this&nbsp;
point, I think, a way of summing up a project is&nbsp;

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:44.640
to give birth to a new kind of human being, to&nbsp;
giving birth to what I call the future human.&nbsp;

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:49.760
Some people call it homo-spiritualis,&nbsp;
homo-noeticus, there are different words for it.&nbsp;

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:58.000
But a new form of human being who isn't simply the&nbsp;
old human being polished up and cleaned up and,&nbsp;

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:05.840
you know, doing better, but truly a revolution&nbsp;
that causes the plate tectomics of the collective&nbsp;

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:13.040
psyche to shift so that all children born after&nbsp;
this shift takes place, and I'm not talking about&nbsp;

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:18.320
a shift that takes place in 24 hours&nbsp;
but takes place over decades of work.&nbsp;

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:24.880
All children born after this pivot are literally&nbsp;
functioning within a different collective psyche.&nbsp;

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.360
This is something that's taking place&nbsp;
at a very, very deep collective level.&nbsp;

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:36.960
And I was given teachings to explain how&nbsp;
this is working out through reincarnation,&nbsp;

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:42.840
what the project of reincarnation is, how does&nbsp;
it play into this. I introduced concepts that&nbsp;

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:48.320
will talk about the birth of the diamond soul,&nbsp;
this integration of all of our former lives coming&nbsp;

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:55.680
into a unity synthesis and leading to&nbsp;
an exponential explosion of insight&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.080
and compassion inside the
human heart and human mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.400
That's what we're going to be&nbsp;
talking about. We're going to be&nbsp;

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:08.400
talking about where humanity is taking, where&nbsp;
reincarnation is taking humanity, what some of&nbsp;

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:17.280
the mechanisms are trying to understand underneath&nbsp;
the turmoil of our times, which are getting more&nbsp;

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:25.920
and more tumultuous almost year by year, and where&nbsp;
we might be going, what the larger project is.&nbsp;

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:34.720
And I must confess I found what I was given&nbsp;
deeply reassuring because I feel the growing&nbsp;

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:42.320
waves of darkness. I feel the chaos and I see&nbsp;
the social struggle that we don't know how to&nbsp;

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:51.360
navigate the falling apart process. But I take&nbsp;
great strength in being given an understanding&nbsp;

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.480
of what's going on here at a deeper level. And&nbsp;
that's what I'd like to share with you in our next&nbsp;

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:02.560
conversation. Well, I'm very much looking forward&nbsp;
to the conversation about the birth of the&nbsp;

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:08.880
future human. And Chris, is there anything&nbsp;
else you want to share about collective&nbsp;

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:16.400
karma and reincarnation today? Well, I'll just&nbsp;
share one visionary experience which I share in&nbsp;

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:23.200
LSD And The Mind of The Universe. It was late in&nbsp;
my journey. It was, I don't know, 15 years or so&nbsp;

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:31.040
into my journey. And I had already gone through&nbsp;
multiple layers of death into deeper and deeper&nbsp;

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:40.080
levels. And I opened up into a very, very deep&nbsp;
level in which I experienced all of humanity&nbsp;

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:50.560
as a single organism reincarnating generation&nbsp;
by generation. The entire family of humanity&nbsp;

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:57.280
was going through this developmental process&nbsp;
that all of us individually are going through.&nbsp;

01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:04.080
And experiencing all of humanity&nbsp;
in this flow of learning,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:07.440
and in this flow of perpetual development,&nbsp;

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:14.480
potential integration of more and more spiritual&nbsp;
reality into their lives, was on the one hand,&nbsp;

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:23.680
an extremely uplifting experience. And it was&nbsp;
also a devastating experience because I saw&nbsp;

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:30.560
from the one perspective, you might say that&nbsp;
whole generations will be sacrificed in this&nbsp;

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:37.120
historical transformation we're going through.&nbsp;
And it had the ruthlessness of Kali the Destroyer,&nbsp;

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:46.320
of the gods which bring death and destruction&nbsp;
in order to liberate. And at the same time,&nbsp;

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:51.280
this was not something which is being done&nbsp;
to us. This is a role that we voluntarily&nbsp;

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:57.920
took on as our offering to the creative&nbsp;
intelligence in the evolution of this species&nbsp;

01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:05.360
at this point in time. So it was a hard teaching,&nbsp;
and it was a magnificent ecstatic teaching all&nbsp;

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:12.640
at the same time. And the key is just to realize&nbsp;
that what is taking place in the lives of&nbsp;

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:19.160
individuals is also taking place in the lives&nbsp;
of the species. We are all in this world,&nbsp;

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:24.640
and we are all in this together. Ultimately,&nbsp;
we all have to move together. Some people may&nbsp;

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.440
get a little ahead, some people may drag a little&nbsp;
behind, but ultimately we are moving together as&nbsp;

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:39.840
we move through this transition. And the&nbsp;
magnitude of the beauty of what we are becoming,&nbsp;

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.080
I don't know how I'm going to talk about that&nbsp;
without crying when we talk next. This is so&nbsp;

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:51.840
magnificent. Oh, I know I teared up a few times&nbsp;
in this conversation today. And also when I read&nbsp;

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:57.120
your fabulous book, LSD And The Mind of The&nbsp;
Universe, it is very deeply moving and I look&nbsp;

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.720
forward to exploring more with you in the next&nbsp;
conversation. Chris Bache, thank you so much&nbsp;

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:10.960
once again for this incredible conversation that I&nbsp;
hope many find insightful and hopefully uplifting&nbsp;

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:17.760
in this journey of life that we're all a part&nbsp;
of together. Thank you for being with me today.&nbsp;

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.600
Thank you, Emmy. It's been a real&nbsp;
pleasure and an honor. Thank you.&nbsp;

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:24.960
My pleasure as well. And for those&nbsp;
of you watching or listening,&nbsp;

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.600
thank you for being with us because&nbsp;
you are the reason that we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.080
here.

      <p>[Music] [Music] and eventually you come out with a certain understanding at least of the large structure the nature of of reality where not simply creating a new Society or a better Society or a new economy or a new ecology we are actually giving birth to a new form of the human species I never expected anything like this to emerge in the work I I didn't know that this was even possible at the subtle level of Consciousness you open up to different levels of collective Consciousness and so when your individual identity Pops I have had the experience many times of opening up to my species identity to the collective psyche well I'm always hesitant to jump into this because my experience are based upon shamanic you know rigorous use of LSD and when everyone hears LSD they think all the 60s they think hallucinations they think you know and this is very far from this this is really within a therapeutic tradition it's within Stang grath's tradition it's the systematic the systematic use of these very hyper intense states of awareness and when you engage these states there is cycles of tremendous purification tremendous death and reborn and death and reborn but if you go through it often enough deeply enough there is a progressive initiation into deeper and deeper levels of reality um and eventually you come out with a certain understanding at least of the large structure the nature of of reality and uh it's not easy to summarize but I mean I've tried to do it in this book I'm just finishing diamonds from Heaven to describe the progression one of the qualities of of that come out of this vision of cosmology is that there are many many levels to the cosmos the physical world is simply kind of like a dense level and of course there are layers and layers and layers within the physical world as we get into the quantum level but as you build out into non-physical or extraphysical Dimensions there are levels layers and layers and it's a repeated experience that the lower levels are sourced in the higher levels the higher levels are the deeper levels are more intelligent more intense energetically um and they are more conscious so the experience going out into them is you're going into a more conscious more powerful more Source dimension of existence until eventually you know you leave behind time space And Then There are dimensions which Echo time space the bar what the Tibetans call the Bardo you know the the intermediate dimensions and one can go eventually even beyond all the Echoes of time and space and enter what uh some of the spiritual Traditions would call extra samsaric reality a reality beyond all the cycles of death and rebirth and enter in the domain of just pure light just just pure light and the quantum physicists say everything all molecules are ultimately rooted in light you know photons are light and I find that's true when in the domain of Consciousness in the universe that one perceives is that ultimately all physical reality is sourced in an ocean of light an ocean of Radiance you can't take your ego into that reality and have an experience of that reality you can only enter those realities by surrendering what you were in the lower realities and it's not that these lower realities are inferior or bad or evil or or anything like that it it's just that they are more specific manifestation of progressively individualized ized manifestation of this larger reality so that you reverse the process when you go out into that reality you have to decouple let go of you know at deeper level so that you literally become for hours at a time a citizen of that level of reality you have to stop being Cris you have to stop being a human being you have to stop being a time space being at all you you literally live and breathe the nature of that existence there is a sense always of profound homecoming of profound return you know that we came all existence comes from this reality so there's that tremendous sense of of uh Stillness calm reunion um uh being restored to your Primal wholeness um and one gets the sense that these levels are constantly infusing and informing this reality we have a theory of evolution which our theories of evolution are partly right and partly deeply incomplete we think it's all Happening by chance screened by necessity you know it's all but it I my experience is it's not being driven by chance I mean chance has a factor but there is a a tremendous intelligence manifesting itself in the self- emergent quality of time and space so there is a there is an intelligence manifesting it's not a god outside manipulating and it's not even like Creative Design kind of manipulating but it's a self- arising intelligence a self-emerging intelligence it's manifesting ever more complex forms of life and it's evolving and it's changing one of the other things that comes when you move into these deep Dimensions you move Beyond linear time as we conventionally know it into deep dimensions of time and sometimes even Beyond any time sense of time whatsoever but when you're coming in and out of these different states you get a perspective of that this reality is changing we know this it's changing but you get a sense of where it's changing too what the next phase of human evolution might be where we seem to be going and we're going somewhere and there is an intelligence expressing itself in this process and so the end result there's a sense in which I trust you just learn to trust where you are that there is an a wisdom in where you are doing what you're doing and somehow each one of our works contribute to the larger pattern of the creative intelligence manifesting it myself inside time and space I was totally uh completely surprised I never expected anything like this to emerge in the work I I didn't know that this was even possible I had never seen it addressed in the Psychedelic literature but when you when you pop the B the bubble of the ego when when you pop you don't simply drip drop into unitive conscious or Oneness Consciousness but you open up into different at the subtle level of Consciousness you open up to different levels of collective Consciousness and so when your individual identity pops you I have had the experience many times of opening up to my species identity opening up to the collective psyche to and I found that that species Consciousness is coherent Carl Yung was right and there is a coherent species mind and as the shamanic traditions and when you touch the species mind in deep States Of Consciousness it's only natural that insights into what the evolutionary progression of the growth process of this species is and I over many years I had repeated experiences doing taking me deeper and deeper and teaching me there was a Consciousness teaching me what's what what's happening and and showing me that the visions that came I'll just report the Visions for whatever was that Humanity was coming into a time of tremendous fruition that we had been un developing for hundreds of thousands of years and we were coming to a pinnacle a a tremendous Great Awakening A A an opening of a a new level of Consciousness in humanity and that this was a pivot point everything we had accomplished would kind of quickly become POS say as we pivoted into this new platform of Consciousness but for there to be a a Great Awakening a birth of a new Consciousness there must first take place a great death as the mystics go through a Dark Night of the soul to awaken into Divine Consciousness Humanity was going to have to go through a great dark KN of the soul of our Collective Soul in order to purge Purge the karmic residue of all of its egoic driven competitions hostility violence the things we do to each other the things we can't take that you know this world we live in is a world built by ego we are moving into a larger reality and we have to we have to let go of all those old restrictive poisons and I think we're we're coming into a time of great crisis the Visions showed me that we're coming into a a dark night of purification I I don't know the details of it I just have experienced it uh I think it's going to be starting in the 21st century I don't know how long it will last I don't know how long we'll go through but it'll it's a time of loss of control of breaking down of of of a destructuring of Life as we know it but coming out of it we not simply creating a new Society or a better Society or a new economy or a new ecology we are actually giving birth to a new form of the human species we're a we're the the fundamental architecture of the collective psyche is pivoting and as it pivots we will We are giving birth to a new blueprint for Humanity and the way I've seen it manifesting is in in the Visions in in my psychedelic experience and other experiences reincarnation is just accepted as a matter of fact so we we die we go we're born we die we're born keeps going up keep going on and Lifetime by LifeTime we rewind we're we're collecting more and more experiences and in my sessions we reached a point where I was reintegrating all my former lives we're coming together like winding kite string around a a spool and it it hit a critical mass and it exploded into the most brilliant luminous Diamond light in my heart it just exploded in me and I think what I saw in this experience what I what I was being shown was where reincarnation is taking us we're not just going through class from the first grade to the second grade to the third grade we're not simply adding incremental improvements in our life but sooner or later we come to a fusion point where all of our souls all of our Lives all of our experiences hit a critical mass and are fused and when that happens the soul awakens inside the human body when we die we return to the soul the mega Consciousness that holds us all but this is an Awakening of the Soul inside time and space and I think that's the future human that we're birthing we've been gestating this Consciousness for hundreds of thousands of years we're giving birth to it now but most of the work has been done most of the work has been done in history but now it's time for all of this inner development to to manifest and I think when we awaken as Souls when we when our deep Consciousness awakens it will change life on our planet that because it it will make our mind safe because our heart will be open and we will no longer represent a danger to each other and to other species on the planet and there'll be a much easier communion with the deeper creative consciousness of the universe so that appear a time of tremendous creativity acceleration of creativity and in my very end of this long 20year journey the very last sessions I was put through a tremendous strip down process and thrown deep into the future I don't know how far but deep into the future and allowed to experience it felt like I I tried I was allowed to try on that form and the most beautiful beautiful being just extraordinary being and I it's really important for us to understand that we are giving birth to something magnificent because if we don't have a vision of what's happening in history we will get swallowed by the pain of the purification that's coming and we we must hold firm we must stand firm and not get not yield to despair a mother giving birth is in terrible pain but she knows what she's doing we are giving birth we have to understand what we're doing I mean we have have a tendency in our theologies and in our stories that we tell to explain our existence to think very statically of human nature because it doesn't seem to be changing too fast so we think of static human nature static human nature but when you when you expand the Horizon even intellectually or with imagination or experientially when you expand the time Horizon at least what I was given to experience was that humanity is built for speed and it has to do with each of our learning Cycles or 100 years 100 years 100 years 100 years but the universe does not think in 100e increments the universe thinks in billions and trillions of year increments and from that perspective Humanity it seems to be designed for Accelerated Evolution so that you know in the long scale we're moving very fast through time so all of our history all of our every all the pains we've done the mistakes we've made the we've done we're carrying them in our person but we can shed them if our concentration if our awareness is intensified as I think they will be intensified in the trials that are coming if we pay attention and do our work well and live very deeply We Can Shed that past very quickly and as we shed that past we can enact the soul in history he had the he tells his story in four journeys of being being taken into the not great distant future he later said it was about Thousand Years out where uh when he was taken into that future and looked back that all of the BAU was emptied all of the all the souls in the ble were emptied and there was a much cleaner and clearer communion between physical beings and uh Consciousness spiritual consciousness and and there was a it was easier to kind of do a temporary visit to kind of come into share physical life form leave it alone come back into spiritual reality and I think that's kind of simp that's another way of describing what we're going to because the BAU is this layered reality surrounding time and space where it's filled with soul fragments unintegrated pieces of experiences at different levels and as we become more integrated as we become more coherent we're emptying the BAU and as we empty the BAU the communion between deep spiritual reality and physical reality becomes easier becomes clear we've seen it happen for individuals there are great Saints who are translucent to this reality but I think they are foreshadowing what's happening for the whole species and we're going into that direction as a as an entire species I I think we have an extraordinary future ahead we have to we have to some hard work but underneath yeah and you other thing that has come through my sessions is uh that the Divine is very happy with us and everything that everything is right on time I mean we have we make so many mistakes we do so many things badly but in the long view the sense I get is that we're working hard and we're doing a pretty good job and it's going to be more hard work but overall the Divine is very pleased and again I hate to use the word the Divine but the creative consciousness of the universe uh is very happy with what's happening you [Music] [Music] toe long to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] more of Fe [Laughter] [Music]</p>

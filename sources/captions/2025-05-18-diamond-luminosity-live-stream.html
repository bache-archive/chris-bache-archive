okay and then we'll shut that and then I'm going to go ahead and share my screen is it not minimizing there we go and so as of this moment announcements are being sent out to of our followers and they'll be logging in and so they'll be able to hear everything we say and their screen will sort of look like this they'll see little thumbnails of our images mhm so in just a minute I'll start the countdown clock timer and then for those listening and joining welcome and thank you for being with us if you want to chat in where you're joining from in the world from your neck of the word uh neck of the woods in the world we'd love to hear where you're from and then in just a minute I'll start the timer i might mention um for people who are watching the archival video and they're wondering why do they have to sit through 10 minutes of our conversation beforehand before we begin the program and it's because once we start the timer and go live uh YouTube automatically makes this archival recording which YouTube then takes public so uh I suppose the option would be uh for us to capture a recording on um on our hard drive and then edit it before we let it go public so in theory we could edit out the first 10 minutes because I I got a complaint from a viewer who who was unhappy that uh they had to at least they didn't understand they could fast forward I suppose to the beginning of the uh video so for viewers who who don't want to sit through our preliminary conversation fast forward at 10 minutes right that's why there's a timer it says 9 minutes until live stream but this is yeah to give a notification so that our subscribers will be notified that we're going live in a few minutes and if we were to take it down and re-upload it the only thing is is that we've already shared this particular URL all over the internet so then we would lose this particular UR yeah would have to have a new URL i I kind of like keeping things the way they are yeah because I if I were to start downloading the it and we're on Zoom it's a Zoom video which is not the highest quality from the Zoom recorder to be honest and then I would want to anytime you mention another person I would want to insert a book cover or something the way we normally do for our interviews which would create additional delays but this way the archival video goes up as soon as we finish talking yeah it's pretty easy just to Yeah fast forward a YouTube video to when it actually begins and typically by the time the day is over there are three or four times as many people who watch the archival video as who were with us live how many years have you been doing this Jeffrey i started in 1972 doing interviews but the YouTube channel this is our 10th year on YouTube okay i began KPFA radio Pacifica radio nonprofit station in Berkeley back in 1972 that's a lot of good information streamed out to a lot of people yeah really and and I was guided to do it uh by a dream really yes at at a time in my life when I didn't own a radio or a television and I was a long-haired Berkeley hippie I didn't believe in radio or television i thought they were all phony baloney but I had this dream and I acted on it and changed my mind and I've for most of the ra last half century I've been doing interviews wow that's fascinating another example of the wisdom of the deep consciousness of the world communicating and giving uh us directions in our private lives our so-called private lives yeah and I'm very interested in in people who have had what I would call lifech changing dreams uh because that that dream that I had was a lifecher i mean here I am half a century later still acting on that information yeah yeah and live streams have been on YouTube have been what three four years Jeffoff you've been doing these yeah um maybe even I think maybe five years yeah in fact yes five years yeah like usually every two to three weeks we have fabulous guests on like you Chris and how did you get into this particular role emmy what drew you here well Jeff was a guest on my podcast back in 2018 and I originally learned about him and Thinking Aloud on public television back in 1987 when I was probably 13 years old and he was Yeah uh interviewing wonderful people back even even then on public television from 1986 to 2002 although my understanding was is that it was sent out to on the the satellite in 1987 so I began watching it and was just fascinated and very intrigued with the information i didn't understand all of it at the time because I was 13 but I understood enough that I wanted to learn more and in retrospect I think it really did help set the tone for my career in understanding more about holistic health intuition spirituality consciousness and even back then Jeff you were talking about UFOs and interviewing people like Jacqu Valet and John Mack and and I thought well this man is really intelligent there must be something to all of this and then I was researching for a book I wrote and about intuition and Jeff's name kept coming up and then I realized oh Jeffrey Michishlov he was the host of that program and then I realized he had a doctorate in parasychology which was very downplayed on that original program and and then I thought well I'd love to talk to him and I'll invite him on my podcast and he said yes and then in 2020 Jeff you put out a call for volunteers and then I started volunteering with you and then he won the Bigalow essay competition for the best evidence for the continuation of consciousness in the afterlife in 2021 so he invited me to be a guest host and then shortly thereafter I became the co-host and then now he's invited other guest hosts and yeah I'm just grateful to be here and help share this information and learn from one of the best best people in the field doing this in such in such a way our lives are all intertwined around each other aren't they yeah yeah very true yeah and Chris I know we're going to learn more about you in a few minutes when did you start I know you've been you were a professor for many many years when did you start public speaking or getting interested in these kind of topics well you know when I started the LSD work in 79 I had to keep it pretty under tight wraps i mean I just couldn't bring it out publicly at all and it wasn't until I wrote Dark Knight Early Dawn which was my first book on psychedelic work um which which came out in 2000 that I began going to conferences and began to teach at CIS in that area but I really didn't go public until I retired from the university in 2013 and um then I you know I was working on LSD in the mind of the universe for five years during that period and when it finally came out in 2019 I became I was more public just increasingly public so I was out of the psychedelic closet formally kind of when that book came out and it's a wonderful book thank you lsd and the mind of the universe i really enjoyed reading it and I like how you also put many of your session notes in there which was you kind of you bring the reader i felt like I was sometimes along on the trip with you yeah that's what I wanted to do my sense was that in order to have the philosophical conversation about the potential of psychedelics first people have to understand what happens in deep sessions so the first task was descriptive and then later the second or third round would be more evaluative and analytic uh so I I really tried to bring the reader along with me into those sessions so I had to learn a whole new way of writing i had to lose my academic uh voice and develop a different voice well you did it beautifully i I would say you nailed it thank you yeah so we just got about a minute before we officially begin the program i think in retrospect that u the impulse that I had to act on that dream and and to be alert to it and so on i was primed for that uh from having had LSD a number of times prior yeah yeah and we the depth of our interweaving continues to go yeah mhm all right welcome everybody i'm Jeffrey Michionlo i'm with my co-host Emmy Vades and our honored guest Chris Bich and Emmy will you introduce Chris yes hello and welcome everybody we're so grateful to have Chris Bash with us today who is professor emmeritus in the department of philosophy and religious study studies at Youngstone State University in Ohio where he taught for 33 years he is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies emmeritus excuse me ameritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences and on the advisory council of gra legacy training chris is author of Life Cycles: Reincarnation in the Web of Life Dark Knight Early Dawn The Living Classroom: Teaching and Collective Consciousness and LSD and the Mind of the Universe Diamonds from Heaven and his website is chrisb.com with an E at the end welcome Chris we're so happy to have you here today to get us started do you want to just go ahead and share a little bit about your background and we also want to let people know that Chris has been a guest on New Thinking Aloud with a recorded interview talking about psychedelics and the cosmic mind well uh I'm actually the last person you would have thought from the beginning of my life to end up um writing a book on uh describing what happens on a long series of highdosese LSD sessions i was raised in the deep south in Mississippi i was a a seminarian in the early days i was studying to be a Catholic priest but eventually I left that uh because celibacy and I didn't get along very well uh got degrees in theology and New Testament criticism and eventually uh philosophy of religion from Brown University so I had a very classical very traditional upbringing uh I the the psychedelic 60s passed me by entirely uh and it wasn't until I got to graduate school i mean I got to teaching in 1978 and I was looking around for where to take my research that I encountered the work of Stannislav Gr and his book Realms of the Human Unconscious was a lifecher for me because I saw immediately the philosophical significance of his work if what he was saying was true it had profound implications for how we could do philosophy in the future not just healing but actually explore the metaphysical structure underlying structure of reality so um uncomfortably I made the decision to I knew I needed to do this work i knew I had to begin my own psychedelic work and I was uncomfortable breaking the law but I chose to begin very private circumscribed work uh in this modality using Stan Gross protocol so I divided my life into two parts during my day job I was a traditional member of the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngtown State and kind of my night job was doing working with psychedelics exploring the I was healing my own psyche working in exploring the deep structure of the collective psyche and then what lies beyond the collective psyche and I worked for four years i stopped for six years for reasons that I give in the book and then I resumed for another 10 years so basically between the time when I was 30 and 50 years old I did 73 highdosese LSD sessions using a tight therapeutic protocol uh and then I took another 20 years to digest and assimilate those experiences and to kind of connect the dots in those experiences before publishing um LSD in the mind of the universe in 2019 so uh actually it was after I finished my sessions in one of my meditations uh I heard this voice say 20 years in 20 years out which I took to mean that it would take me at least 20 years to integrate and digest all the experiences that I had collected in those 20 years now now I think that might have been an overly optimistic assessment because I don't think I have nearly integrated all the experiences that I had collected in those first 20 years wow so you feel like you're still integrating the experiences very much so in fact it it raises it's has raised substantial kind of intellectual uh questions how do you possibly integrate experiences which so radically transcend the conditions of time and space and our consciousness inside time and space if you have temporary experiences which go radically beyond spatial consciousness radically beyond temporal consciousness and linear time how do you in what does it mean even to integrate those experiences i mean it really comes down the things I'm thinking about these days is what does integration even look like what does it mean when you're dealing with such radical experiences if you're dealing with lower dose work or gentler psychedelics where the experiences come closer to your world inside time and space integration is less demanding but if you really open up to the very deep waters of the deep psyche integration becomes a more substantive issue all right well we're getting lots of questions coming in and I think this question from Robert Bushman might be a a good place to start perhaps is what is consciousness is there an ultimate reality or is it infinitely fractal i guess there's a few questions in here how can an individual's conscious awareness expand without psychedelics how can one remember past lives which actually is a maybe a separate question but maybe starting out with what is consciousness yeah well you know I'm happy to let the psychologists and philosophers tear their hair out on that one i'm willing to sort of go with whatever definition they come up with as long as it's sufficiently broad to incorporate the total phenomenology of consciousness i mean sort of simply con consciousness comes from conscio to know with consciousness is that with which we know so it is the knowing function it is the awareness of our cognitive capacity through which we know anything else um and so again then we ask the question well how big is consciousness we have a tendency to think that consciousness kind of fits inside our skull but now increasingly we realize that's not an adequate understanding because of all sorts of empirical parasych parasychological research so I think of it more as u consciousness is a field uh that our brain allows us to consolidate and and structure inside our physical existence but consciousness in its own right is an field and being a field it's open-ended and it's then if you ask how big is that field then we get into the real cosmological adventure because uh we find at least I found that in if you really go deep into your psyche you drop first into the personal unconscious into your personal psyche if you keep pushing deeper you drop into the collective psyche the territory Tory Jung described but you can go deeper than that and drop below the entire psyche of the of the human species you can transcend the species psyche and then you're in a you're in dimensions of consciousness that truly um I think of it as the either the mind of God or I prefer to think of it as the mind of the universe that as vast as the universe is you know and we know we have a rough approximation of how many billions of galaxies are in the universe and how huge it is how old it is that consciousness that this universe has a mind and the mind is as deep and broad and old as the universe's body is so that my individual experience of consciousness is a simple drop a fractal aspect of the totality of consciousness that flows and that's why I gave the book the title LSD and the mind of the universe because when you go very deep using a very powerful and circumscribed protocol you drop into deeper and deeper layers and you're given the opportunity to explore the very nature of of physical reality itself i think we just lost your video Chris i lost the video here let's see what's We have the audio okay let me see if I can get as if the camera is pointing somewhere else yeah let me see if I don't know why it dropped but I can shift to a different camera there we go okay there's a we've got you we've got a view of you now here so okay wonderful okay good you are back well I think it's important to emphasize uh early on in our discussion or to repeat what you said in your earlier interview with Emmy that you are not recommending that other people do what you did take many uh high doses of LSD that way and uh I know one of our viewers has raised the question about uh what kind of people or what populations of people should not use psychedelics first I absolutely agree i mean I really do not recommend that people adopt the protocol that I adopted knowing what I know at the end of this journey i if I were starting it from scratch I would be much gentler on myself i would work with much lower doses i would balance uh the organic psychedelics with the synthetic psychedelics and I just would take a much gentler approach in u but I was young when I did this work i had a a number of assumptions that I was making that turned out not to be accurate um and I would just be much gentler and uh much more circumscribed in the project and there are many many people types of people who who shouldn't be working with psychedelics um they're for either physiological reasons or psychological reasons to work with the amplifying quality i mean psychedelics are amplifiers of consciousness they take what is far away and make it available to you and they take what is low volume and make it higher volume so it it's a tremendous kind of inversion an explosion of awareness and if you are prepared for it if you have the discipline for it and if you have the training to navigate those transitions and if you're working with professionals who can help you navigate okay but um there are a lot of people I think are best based and probably the majority of people are best kind of working um in gentler techniques yoga and meditation or transdancing a number of things which have the same amplifying effect in a more gentle fashion uh which do in which we can do a great deal of very good work without taking uh psychedelics at all in fact in the mail that I've gotten from my writing on psychedelics they many of the people who have written me have never taken psychedelics or they've taken psychedelics once or twice early in their life but they've been a meditator for 50 or 50 years and they are engaging the cosmology that emerges in my story and comparing it to the cosmology that has emerged for them in their meditative experience and finding strong parallels and so the at the deepest level the issue is not psychedelics the issue is consciousness the boundaries and and the functions of consciousness itself so but some people should kind of stay away from these powerful amplifiers yeah and how many micrograms or what was the dose that you were usually working at because I know after we did that interview people were some people were chatting in and asking what those levels were and I think you like you said you would go lower if you were to do it over again after the first three sessions which are medium dose sessions I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms which is right at the body's maximum um capacity to absorb if meaning if you took more you don't necessarily go deeper more less uh so I was working at at very high levels that basically have the potential to just shatter the you know the structures of consciousness and take you temporarily beyond your traditional uh ways of knowing yourself uh and knowing the world and again I would be much gentler in the early days stand differentiates between psychotherapy layer over up to And but at Spring Grove they experimented with uh working with a population of clients who were dying of cancer they were they were terminal patients and they were trying to address death anxiety and they worked with highdosese LSD sessions essentially trying to trigger a near-death experience so these people could have an insight into where they were going and therefore relieve the anxiety of death and it was quite successful but the protocol limited highdosese work to three sessions and I came along after years later and I thought well uh if you could work success uccessfully three times you could do it more than three times uh and so I adopted that protocol and eventually in time I learned I had a a capacity in an aptitude for working at those levels i could I could let go and expand into the deep psyche comfortably enough and I also did not have problems consolidating i tended to consolidate comfortably and strongly uh and it's just it's it is an unusual uh an unusually intense protocol i wouldn't do it again i'd do it differently yeah in fact you have shared I believe in your book and when we had our previous conversation that near-death experiencers are the group of people you often relate to with your own experiences with LSD is that right yeah i feel the closest in some ways to people who have near-death experiences of any population uh because by when their body almost dies they are catapulted into very deep states of consciousness they get glimpses of the world they engage the world and I think um there's a strong overlap between what happens in a deep near-death experience and what happens in a deep psychedelic therapeutically structured experience the difference is that primarily near-death people get only one take on that reality and if you work with psychedelics like I have you get multiple immersions multiple initiations into that reality so that what becomes a flashing one-time exposure becomes a journey and becomes a a communion that is repeated and deepened over time yeah oops dumping that okay we have a question from a viewer whose YouTube name is Greasy Slick who would like to know if you've ever experimented with DMT which is considered I believe the most powerful psychedelic i have experience with other psychedelics other than LSD though I consider my LSD work to be my primary uh body of work i've I have had some experiences with DMT U of course and and MDMA and Salvia Dorum and San Pedro um I've had experiences with 5MO DMT which is an extremely powerful uh short acting psychedelic i don't have a lot of experiences with 5MOD DMT i feel like I'm just beginning to nibble uh on that uh after a long period of not working with psychedelics because I stopped my work primarily in 1999 and and much of my work with these other psychedelics came after 1999 when I wasn't so much concerned with pushing new boundaries i was concerned with helping me integrate the work that I had already done uh but yeah 5me DMT is an extraordinarily um powerful and provocative uh psychedelic and I've had limited experience with ketamine the highdosese ketamine sessions are you able to draw any meaningful comparisons between those and theens and LSD well that's a conversation we have to go into very carefully and I don't think I have enough experience to really uh and I don't have enough knowledge of other people's experiences to be able to make a fair comparison at this time uh I do think that um there is a certain advantage to uh psychedelics that open a long window uh a window that stays open for a long period of time like LSD or maybe a little less psilocybin where if you're dealing with something like 5me DMT it's a very very intense immersion but it's a very short acting a very short window and you don't have as much time for the infinite consciousness that you're accessing or entering into communion with to to impact you and to clean you and to transform your life and I think this is what Rick Strossman found in his book um on DMT the spirit molecule where he took people with DMT into very intense experiences and some of them had very deep experiences but in the end he found that they did not change their lives very much these experiences were not deeply transformative and I personally think that part of the reason is because it is so short acting uh versus a long acting large window but then again uh even a a psychedelic like LSD relatively speaking is relatively short acting in terms of compared to other meditational practices for example where the window is open for a much longer period of time so if we combine uh meditation and contemplative and yogic disciplines with the psychedelic practices which give you a window to experience then you have I think maybe the optimal conditions for balancing the virtues of one and the virtues of the other uh and amplifying the transformative effect yeah wonder offhand how many people who do take LSD and it's been widely used in our culture how many of those people really have had their lives transformed uh the way you have and I think I have to say the way I have but I'm under the impression that many many people of our generation took LSD and they weren't even trying to transform their lives it was more a question of partying yeah I think that's the case and uh and nothing wrong with that i you know I have no criticism of that but it is to me a kind of a wasted opportunity it so much hinges the to me the productivity of these really for philosophical exploration or therapeutic applications depends on how you handle these precious hours of band awareness if you kind stay in touch physical world and you're having a time you're at a concert or you're in nature or you're with some friends then that lends itself to a certain kind of millure a certain level of encounter but if you isolate yourself if you adopt kind of a a zazen atmosphere if you create a ka of practice where you're isolated from the world you're wearing eye shades so you know that whatever you're experiencing is coming only from within yourself and if you engage that with you know conscious intention singular intent and allow it to take you where it wants to take you which is often not where you would like to go it takes you into the places that you hurt the most and then it takes you into places that you don't even understand why it hurts so much when you're going into it because you're going beyond the edge of the maps of the personal psyche but if you focus it with that intent then uh something very exciting uh opens up as a possibility uh because you you not only have the opportunity to heal all these knots that are kind of locked in your heart from however many incarnations you've had but you also as these kind of are healed and are unlocked your receptivity to the larger fields of consciousness which are always there always you know bringing that their energy to us uh increases and that really that I think is worth a hell of a lot of concerts you know yeah chris can you expand a little bit more about what your session structures were like because somebody commented in the conversation that we had they asked why didn't he just go out and hang out in the mountains and nature and and how you had somebody there with you as well and I think you looked to Stannis Grath for how to go about that is that right yeah I you know I was Stan's work is so formidable and his intellectual synthesis of so many traditions is so important that he became my kind of foundation for doing this work and again remember I was I was doing this work in Ohio i was a long way from San Francisco i was not part of a psychedelic community i was not part of an Iawaska group that going down to Peru regularly to work with indigenous shamans there i was really working alone and I adopted the protocol that Stan had outlined um in his book LSD psychotherapy published in 1980 right in the very early years of my work and so my protocol and first I think it's it's wonderful to to go sit in nature and do a low or moderate dose of psychedelics and enter into that kind of communion that can open it's just not what I did um so my days would always start early in the morning uh I would have everything set up i would be either at a third floor of our home or later when we started having children and I worked in my wife's office carol was a clinical psychologist and she was my sitter for all of my sessions so we would start in the early morning i would do meditation yoga body stretching and whatnot and then we would begin the session uh they were all guided with very carefully selected music so that Carol had a library of music available to her because you want to pace the rhythm of the open the full and the decline of the session different types of music are appropriate for different stages of that process and you can get lots of examples of this music from holotropic breath work sites which often catalog extensive libraries for this type of work so basically I would spend all day uh lying down with eye shades and the only way my sitter primarily related to me was through the music uh one time I took we took a a movie camera and set it up to see if it would be interesting but actually it was frightfully boring because it's all the action is taking place inside it doesn't show much on the outside except periodically throwing up which is you know not that great to watch but so all day and then usually by mid late afternoon uh session is wrapping up but even after the session the formal session wraps up the tail is still very long and I learned that you have to give a lot of space a lot of time uh because that you're it's a the long tail is a good opportunity to reflect upon and to integrate the insights that's emerged because these insights can come and they can be very powerful but like a dream you can lose them uh and it's important to hold on to them as well as you can and so my custom was the day after a session the next morning I would spend that morning as long as it took to write out an complete as thorough an account of each session and I found that uh I had to develop a a strategy for sort of maximizing recall i began I would take the playlist that was used in the session in exactly the order in which the music was played because my sitter had kept a record and then I would play the music while I was writing and I would play each piece of music over and over till I felt I had captured as best I could what happened during that part of the m session and then I went on to the next piece of music and the next piece of music so that by the time I was finished I had as reliable an account as I could create uh of the session and once it's in like that once it's locked in I don't change it it's it's locked um and I found that if I attempted to make improvements on the text uh later my improvements often diluted aspects or they took the sharp edge off of the focus so I basically respect the the text the the sessions as my primary text and that's why in my book uh all the sessions are produced in a italic text to separate them from the commentation commentator that commentate com that take that I put after the session yeah well that's fascinating i believe in psychological terms it's called state dependent memory where you so you were using your music that you were listening to during the session to help recall experience because day after you're sort of one foot in one foot out you know you're and it it's what I call kind of standing at the edge of the well you're you're one foot in and one foot out and by playing the music while you have your cognitive capacities back you can let your mind go back into that territory and capture it have a question here a couple of people have raised it in different ways and it has to do with the way we titled this program using your phrase diamond luminosity so one of our viewers Celia Funk who is also one of our volunteers uh and just had a baby recently congratulations congratulations uh she says "This may be a silly question but does the title diamond luminosity refer to actual diamonds?" And then a a different viewer asks "Well is it related to the Diamond Sutra?" Yeah that's not a silly question at all um let me a little bit of background the phrase diamond luminosity points to states of consciousness that I entered in the last five years of my work so I had already gone through kind of what Stan Gra calls the perinatal process and gone through a really solid ego death i'd gone into um what I came to call later the ocean of suffering working at the collective psyche level i'd gone into archetypal reality i'd gone into causal level reality many adventures um in that process and I was feeling absolutely philosophically satiated and complete by that time because I'd been I was having experiences of profound oneness with existence and even touching the metacosmic void and having standing under the waterfall of cosmic love so I was existentially very satisfied but in the last 5 years and 26 sessions I was catapulted after one more series of death and rebirth experiences into a state of consciousness that was light but exceptionally pure exceptionally clear light clear beyond imagination now I had accessed light many times before when you have a an ego death experience or you have other deep experiences many people encounter the light and it's the light is kind of the signature of these radically expanded divine states of consciousness but when I talk about diamond luminosity I'm trying to describe a particular state of consciousness a hyper hyper clear clear state of consciousness and because I know the Buddhist literature better than other spiritual traditions at least the mystical side of it uh I correlate it with what the Buddhists call Dharmakaya the clear light of absolute reality it is the the foundational metaphysical structure it is the the light out of which the big bang emerges and gives birth to the entire physical universe so it was hyper clear and so it doesn't have anything to do with physical diamonds but it does have something to do with what the diamond sutra is talking about and vadriana Buddhism is vadra diamond so the diamond it's a diamond and there is a at least other also talk about this diamondesque luminosity but I know it best from reading the the Buddhist sources uh about this reality uh and it seems to me that um it correlates with what are described in the tantras and in the vadriana sutras of the d of the dharmicaya beautiful yeah there's a question here from Megan Salar who you've mentioned this a few times about meditation and she says he talks about the importance of meditation and work outside of the psychedelic work what does his daily practice look like or what would he recommend well the longer that I worked with psychedelics the more I appreciated how important it is to have a daily spiritual practice because when you go into psychedelics conscientiously you open your system up to a vast field of consciousness uh progressively deeper and deeper larger and larger and and you open yourself up to enormous flows of energy because I I found that each step into a deeper state of consciousness was a step into a higher level of energy and to stabilize consciousness at that higher level you have to acclimate to the high level of energy that's involved which requires intense hard to describe but very intense purification processes which often have the form of fire and solar flares and volcanic just tremendous fire energy to transform your being so that you can become a being who can live for hours at a time at that very very deep level of consciousness where the world works at this level in causal level reality where it it's a it's a different physics it's a different landscape of consciousness than lower levels of consciousness where you have you still have individual beings doing individual things and having individual experiences so when you open up to these deep levels and then after it's over you come back into your ordinary consciousness I find that it's really important to have a daily spiritual practice to anchor you to help keep your feet uh solid on the ground and also because um the skills that are acquired in a meditative practice in vipasina practice or zazen practice are precisely the kind of skills of observations and non-attachment which you also use in a psychedelic session so they reinforce each other structurally but meditation gives you an environment to process some of the content the cognit content of your temporary sessions but also it gives you an environment uh to process the energy which is ignited and set loose in your psychedelic sessions so that in the chapter on diamond luminosity I talk about uh my work on integrating vajadriana practice with my psychedelic practice and I actually didn't begin the vadriana practice until about the same time I was entering the diamond luminosity and it was Carol who brought me into the vadriana tradition uh because she did a vadriana practice chud for me before one of my psychedelic sessions and the window that opened in that session this is the 45th session so I was had a lot of history by that time but the window that opened was wider deeper and it stayed open longer than had been the case in earlier sessions so I immediately learned that practice and began to do that practice before any psychedelic session i would never go into psychedelic space without doing chud which is a cleansing it means cutting it's a cleansing practice um and I found that when I was working at these very very high energetic levels it sometimes set in motion processes which are very difficult to integrate uh processes my subtle energy system if you know Alex Gay's work and you you see how beautifully he depicts the powerful energies that are triggered in deep psychedelic work after the session is over they can leave your system feeling quite achy and and sort of stretched um and I found that doing vajadriana practice doing the guru yoga practices or deity yoga practices gave that energy a place to run uh when I was back in my ordinary consciousness back in my ordinary body so for lots of reasons both for uh clarification of cognitive content for practicing the teachings that are given to you in your psychedelic sessions uh for managing the energetic consequences of entering into those states i think a daily spiritual practice is really important and I would mention that before I go would go into a psychedelic space uh I would always you I would change my psych my spiritual practice for days and weeks before going into the session and then I would do different practices coming out of the session i would be doing kind of soul integration practices after a session and more cutting clearing practices before the session so there's a lot of subtlety in in practices and I would do yoga i would basically because I would want my body to be as clear and align as possible if I would come to these states and I would also for example make sure get a chiropractor if I needed to because if your if your body is misaligned structurally or muscularly or emotionally uh that's and you amp your energy up then those blocks are going to be amplified and become problematic so good personal hygiene uh good care of your body care of your of yoga uh care of your mind meditation before and after uh I think these are all just good hygiene practices um and so my what I do for my daily practice has changed over time uh I've been a meditator for a long time worked in the Vadriana tradition for a long time though I I do find that one of the places because I'm a talker because I'm an academic and because I like to explain things I find teaching uh is actually has become a spiritual art form for me uh because to enter to try to bring these ideas spiritual ideas to make them available to enter into dialogue with students day after day week after week that requires a a uh or it invites a kind of a a existential posture a spiritual posture it's very demanding kind of work if you're really going to engage students at this very deep existential level so for me teaching is is its own form uh a very demanding form of spiritual practice yeah a thank you for teaching and sharing with all of us here i may have asked you in the interview we did Chris I don't see any questions at the moment coming through quite the same way and I know this could be a long answer but if what what is it that you felt you learned from these sessions what is it that Yeah that is so important that you think our viewers and listeners might benefit from yeah you know that that is a a large topic uh and the challenge of trying to answer that question is doing justice to how many layers of consciousness I went through over this 20-year journey many of our important books on psychedelics are based on a much smaller number of sessions and that tends to create expectations which shrinks the metaphysical window so that Aldis Huxley's book um the doors of perception he wrote after only one session one uh masculine session and Houston Smith's book cleansing the doors of perception where he gathered a lifetime of writing on psychedelics he had only done LSD six times and after that he said the bummers increased and he decided to take Alan Watts's advice once you get the message hang up the phone but that suggest that the only kind of one or small number of messages that might show up which may be the case in a couple of sessions the challenging trying to describe what I learned from it is um first trying to describe the many states stages of initiation that took place uh going from personal to collective to incre to subtler and causal levels of reality and and non-duality so a reporter asked me that question one time and I I made a list of the things which were the highlighted and I included it in the in the last chapter of the book and I can't remember all the things now so I'll just try to approximate my memory i discovered that um underlying all existence is a singular intelligence of unbelievable magnitude of genius and unbelievable intelligence um and that the physical universe is the manifest body of this genius of this creative intelligence so that the world that we're living in is the physical body of the divine and nothing I'm going to say here is new it's the cosmology that emerges in psychedelics is essentially the same cosmology that emerges in the great mystical traditions of classical uh contemplative cultures so there's nothing new it's just a different technique a different trigger protocol for accessing some of these dimensions of consciousness so that all existence is unified in a fundamental one oneness is kind of the one of the core teachings that emerges over and over again uh you can enter into oneness so deeply that you enter into a condition that the Buddhists call shunata emptiness of self or anata nirvana the self is blown out and when you are empty of self deeply you experience the entire world is also empty of cells and if you experience the world as completely empty of separate individual existences then within a differentiation of a physical universe the entire universe lives and breathes as one as Plutinus said so just and you can enter the opportunity to enter into intimacy with this consciousness to to meet it on these special days and to be engaged by this consciousness and go deeper and deeper and deeper into this consciousness and so I'll mention in this context I I didn't have much contact with individual spirit guides or individual deities or individual forms uh my and it's not that I don't think these things exist it just hasn't been my experience and I think it's partly because of the protocol I used and because of the qualities of LSD as a psychedelic that it was grinding me up so fine and spreading my dust so deeply into these layers of reality that transcend individual life beings so that I had many experiences of being at different levels but not many experiences of individual beings so part of it is just the loving the communion that this intelligence is just extraordinary uh and also this oneness this being is loving beyond measure when I have been tapped into the love that this being that brought this being to create and share its existence in this form the love is overwhelming and that really surprised me because I was okay i was expecting you know the creative intelligence to be intelligent but I was surprised by how much love was present uh and so when people talk about love is the primary virtue I mean I understand that i mean that really does i learned that our participation in creation is taking place over hundreds of thousands of years hundreds of thousands of years we that reincarnation is a simple fact of life and that because reincarnation is a fact of life we are not timelmited in our development we have to have an understanding of our spiritual understanding should recognize that it's not what happens in any one particular life which is paramount and it's not over at the end of any one life but it's an ongoing progression that takes us back and forth between spirit and matter over and over again over and over again in an evolutionary exercise that isn't I don't think it doesn't culminate in enlightenment even the classic vision is you get better and better and clearer and clearer until eventually you achieve realization you achieve enlightenment and once you achieve enlightenment you can leave you you transcend samsara the cycles of existence you can permanently go to some off-planet spiritual paradise but I don't think that's my at least what I've been shown and told is it that's not really the project and that's an understandable interpretation from our early experience when we first make contact several thousand years ago with this profound mother universe with the spiritual mother universe it's an understandable cont in uh conclusion because this universe is so beautiful and so ecstatic and and it feels so much like home naturally we think that we want to be there we belong there we came from there and it leads to the the religions of return so that it's all about transcending the limits of human condition and returning to where we came from where we belong which generates up and out cosmologies uh and I think that's a reflection not of the way the world is but of our early understanding of the world which is now deepening now that we have a better understanding of how huge the universe is and how long it's been in existence then we if you really want to understand life you have to begin to think like God you have to think like a galaxy and understand that the the creative intelligence thinks in terms of billions and billions of years it doesn't think in terms of individuals so much as it thinks of whole species whole planetary systems galactic systems and we have to allow ourselves to expand to understand what is our role in such a universe and reincarnation allows us to do that reincarnation helps us understand not only the tensions that are woven into the body that we have and the mind that we have but it also weaves us it gives us an invitation to participate more fully into the divine project so that the goal becomes to achieve realization to achieve some deep experiential grounding of our of our understanding our experience of our true essential nature which is underneath our personality nature but then once we have that once we understand that once we understand that every living thing is grounded in that same reality that the essence of my individuality is the same as the essence of everybody else's individuality we're all in this together then the goal becomes I think to progressively integrate more and more and more spiritual reality into our physical incarnation so that we can truly bring heaven to earth that we can truly transform our physical world into a paradise and we and not in a metaphorical sense but I mean in a literal sense that we eventually will become a species of awakened beings a species of enlightened beings a species of saved beings and a species of enlightened beings creates a different earth than a species of unenlightened beings so the size of the project the communion the opportunity to enter into communion with the project reincarnation is true reincarnation leads to a different story a different anthropology if you will of the whole creative endeavor u those are I guess some of the highlights of the the large ideas that stand out and as I said they're not new these are all wellestablished in our classic mystical traditions and yet we seem to need to continue to hear them over and over and over again we do or some of us apparently need to yeah i think it I feel like I need to me too me too you know and I think one of the the differences it's sometimes said that the age of individual enlightenment is over now it's collective enlightenment that is a challenge we face because and I think that's really true and the 2,000 or so years of individual enlightenment or individual salvation perfectly well understandable but now if we don't if the whole species doesn't awaken we likely won't be able to survive on this planet we have to grow up we have to stop being egoic children and we have to grow up into our soul consciousness and our deeper spiritual nature otherwise we're going to lose the planet i have a question from Pablo Geralda who's one of our volunteers uh Pablo is in Argentina and he asks you Chris if you have advice for somebody who wants to try psychedelics for the first time and what are are there legal ways to do it he's asking and another viewer Gracie Slick uh raises the question how do you acquire LSD to my knowledge uh it's illegal everywhere in the United States and so then there's a question of obviously there is a a market for it but the the question is how do you know what you're getting absolutely first and I do not want to encourage people to break the law i mean it's just let's be careful here this is I I would not want anyone to break the law and get in trouble doing something like this there are people who want to work with Iawaska and they will go to Peru or to Brazil uh to work with in Iawaska communities in Santi Da or Uni Yuno de Vegetital there are iawaska communities in the United States now which have won the right uh to use Iawasa in spiritual context they've won the right from the Supreme Court uh to do this uh they are not plentiful but they are here um among the psychedelics um ketamine is the only one that's legal right now uh the MDMA which is an impathogen more than a strict psychedelic but it's important therapeutic instrument got turned down uh just last year uh but it'll be here it'll be coming back it will be made legal probably within three years psilocybin won't be far behind so what's legal now and what's legal in 10 years will be very different even five years so the number of psychedelics that one might be able to use is increasing in the years to come how do you know whether what you've gotten is pure and that's really an important issue because you do not want street drugs are filled with all sorts of contaminants that you do not want to put into your system and but you can send these to labs um sponsored by the federal government you can send them anonymously to be tested and you'll be told what's in them and so you can check and verify at the state level or the federal level what it is that you've got here what you're taking and how strong it is um so uh yeah and as far as procuring it no comment or that's up to each person to find a path themselves maybe yeah no comment uh because there you can grow mushrooms you can learn how to grow mushrooms i mean you can create your own psilocybin mushrooms uh and there is of course a clear underground throughout the country which uh some of them is some of many much of it is very irresponsible in terms of impurities and but some of the people are very conscientious about this uh but still uh you have to proceed with caution and always test what you have yeah right here's a question from first deacon Gemini they ask "What is the difference between ego death and disassociation or derealization both entail detachment and depending on the person it can feel good bad or neutral yeah well I'm not a psychologist so take what I say on derealization with a grain of salt here uh I understand that to be uh a psychological experience or condition in which you feel yourself to be um dissolving or not grounded in your real or conventional identity um and it is some it's often associated with various forms of psychopathology because if it becomes endemic it it undermines your capacity to function as a strong individual within the world um ego death is sort of similar to that uh but different um it's sometimes said you have to have a strong ego for to go through ego death to have a good ego death um ego death is basically a let me back up if you are grounded in the way most people are in our bodily consciousness in a consciousness which basically reflects the history of this body in in this time reality if you begin to open up into deeper spiritual realities then sooner or later you have to let go of your egoic identity your body mind identity to begin to have access to these deeper broader states where the ego doesn't have a function um in mystical traditions in classic contemplative traditions the death of self is well known and recognized it's it's usually achieved through a lifestyle of compassion a lifestyle of service a lifestyle of of generosity prayer practicing uh spiritual practice contemplative practice it's a slow gradual softening of the heart and an opening up to kind of an infusion of divine flux which is always there it's always pressing it upon us we just the ego keeps it out so if you kind of sacrifice the ego and take it apart through generosity selflessness um acts of of prayer you're making a transition from a consciousness which is time space grounded bodily grounded into a consciousness which is more mystical more open what happens in a psychedelic session is the same process but it's accelerated and intensified uh if I'm thinking now I'm a professor of religious studies so I've always held the spiritual traditions in the back of my mind while I'm doing psychedelic work and to me I've always approached psychedelic work as a spiritual practice even though the goal of my work was kind of different it wasn't awakening so much as it was cosmological exploration but basically taking the lessons that we've learned learned about how to become a more spiritually attuned person from the spiritual traditions and taking that into the psychedelic context and in the psychedelic context where you are very powerfully activating deeper levels of awareness which open up the floodgates in a way to this deeper spiritual reality you reach a point where uh the ego is put under pressure and it just it just ruptures it you you can't contain consciousness within the structure of your ego and when you get a lot of people a lot of psychologists a lot of exercise a lot of ink and sweat over the complexity and strength and durability of the ego but from a spiritual perspective when you get right down to it it's not that hard to take it apart uh you really can just break it apart and when I went through my my major ego death experience the universe just snapped me like a twig uh it didn't involve derealization but it involved a frightening confrontation because I was turned into something which was the exact opposite of everything I had always known myself to be i had always known myself to be a man to be an intellectual to be white uh to be passionately concerned with the meaning of existence in this critical session I was turned into the opposite of this i was turned into women i was turned into women of color women who had no philosophical expectations or interests at all and it was the perfect hell for male academic philosopher it scared the beeas out of me and then when I let go and I allowed myself to become these women then first I was immediately relaxed and I was taken under the arm of the great mother and taken into an extraordinary journey into the lives of women into hundreds and hundreds of women and then after the session was over as I was coming back my male identity reasserted itself because I like being a man but I knew that my masculinity and my whiteness and my intellectual would never confine me the way it had confined me before the the problem wasn't of women of course or or the anti- the non-intellectual issues the problem was the the tight fit that my social identity had on my consciousness and that had to be broken it was as if the universe was saying to me "Listen where you're going gender does not exist let go." And that's when I let go and I went into states of consciousness that don't differentiate between male and female and then eventually going into states of consciousness which don't differentiate between human and non-human all right and then going into states of consciousness which go beyond space and time entirely so it ego death is just that that kind of rupture which can be slow or fast depending on what method you're using to let go of your preoccupation with self you know the Tibetans call it self-clinging you know and we can see self- clinging when you look at a picture the group picture like a class picture and where does your eye go your eye kind of goes quick to where you are in the picture you That's a symptom of self-cleing it's that constant self-referencing into your own life experience which is understandable from one perspective but so sad from another perspective all right so it's like if uh if you take it if you think of the ego like an ice cube and you put an ice cube next to a candle it melts very slowly it drips and melts down and I think this is like what happens in contemplative practice where you melt this ego slowly but if you take the same ice cube and you throw it on a hot iron cast iron skillet it jumps around and it melts faster but it explodes and bounces all over the place and I think that's kind of like how ego death manifests itself in psychedelic sessions so there's not a right way or a wrong way but the pattern is that we have to let go of the confines of these bars that keep us imprisoned in our self-referential existence and do you feel that the ego serves any purpose since we all seem to have it or is it just something to be dissolved or eliminated or accepted and then transformed or however yeah that happens you know I think ego gets a bad w in many spiritual uh traditions and I think the the ego and by that I mean our individual ex identity our individual body mind identity uh it's a beautiful thing it's really it's magnificent and I think it's a cosmologically important thing i think it's one of the major gifts that we are given by entering into time space now a number of spiritual traditions again in the kind of the classic schools they say well the goal is to destroy ego lose ego and to return to God so it's like a drop of water that returns to the ocean when the drop goes back to the ocean it doesn't exist anymore and and that's that the vidantic picture is you basically eliminate ego so that you can live the life divine but you just live the life divine no longer as an individual you just surrender completely and become the divine and I don't think that's an adequate cosmology uh I think that um I think that the creative intelligence has created a system whi which first of all we have a life as individ as an individual and we we explore and deepen and expand this individual experience lifetime after lifetime after lifetime and the goal is not to uh completely abandon our individuality but the goal is to is to engage what is left out of the e individual ego's experience to engage the tremendous power of consciousness the love that runs through existence the intelligence that runs through existence so that you were both an individual but you are all now transparent to the divine condition i don't think individuality is destroyed when you go deeper and deeper i think it's actually transformed and I think individuality is truly one of the great gifts of the mother it's one of the great gifts of time space existence and I think if you study the biographies of the autobiographies or biographies of great spiritual adepts of of great masters you find that they are individual you know they are they are quite distinctive individual so enlightenment is about anata no self but it doesn't mean that your individuality is shattered irrevocably and doesn't come back if that's happening then that's a kind of a form of psychopathology even spiritual pathology i think healthy spiritual maturity is you have individual experience you have your individual reference point but you're not imprisoned within that reference point you build bridges you you connect and receive this you you care about more than just yourself you care about more than just your species you care about more than just your generation and you live large you know you're an individual but you're living a much larger life yeah you you recognize the interconnectedness and perhaps can merge with that and that really seems to be a definition of yoga is union with the divine perhaps yes yeah union with the divine and not dissolving irrevocably so that you don't have an individual awareness or individuality thank you for all of these answers Chris and we just want to let our viewers and listeners know that we are over 60 minutes in we've got about 25 minutes left of the live stream here's a question from a viewer whose YouTube name is Fabius who says "How can we reconcile the ideal of transforming earth into a paradise with the spiritual necessity of contrast and suffering as essential conditions for learning and growth in the human experience?" Great question good question you know that the question of suffering is a a profound question and that we could take the whole program just to explore that particular topic i mean if there is if the creative intelligence is an intelligence and it's loving how could we how could it possibly have tolerated let alone manifested a world which is so painful which which is which terrible things happen uh at a very organic level uh let alone a social level and I think in order in order to really understand and to even have an attempt to compreh rehend suffering we have to develop a very long time horizon we have to look deep into the workings of the universe and we have to sort of adopt a galactic perspective uh and I think this is important to understand that the human species is a radically unfinished species it's a very incomplete species and so if you think well how young are we i mean are we kind of like you know on one to 100 are we 95% finished or are we 5% finished you know and I think we're maybe more like five or 10% finished we just woke up i mean 5,000 4,000 years ago we just woke up to this underlying level of consciousness that we've begun to recognize in the religious traditions this universe has been building this world for 3.7 billion years and we're just waking up in this universe and just coming to understand and to engage in it consciously rather than unconsciously and the capacities that we see in the highest most spiritually realized individuals the capacity of not only compassion but the capacity to have control over their own physical process and even the capacity to have to change matter around them to manipulate matter as some of the great mahasidas have the capacity to do we see in those beings the symptoms or the qualities that are emerging are emergent qualities in spirit in beings who are integrating more and more spiritual capacity inside this physical body so if we look to the future and we ask what is what are we becoming what is the project the project is not human beings as they exist in the 21st century the project is how human beings will exist in the 23rd 25th 3 30th century 40th century and in that context suffering Yeah i don't want to I don't want to a lot of people who are listening who are watching have suffered greatly in their life we've all suffered and some of us have suffered deeply and profoundly in our life and I do not mean to make light of that in any way in anything that I would say uh but suffering is part of the crucible within which we are learning and on this planet and suffering has individual roots sometimes in our individual karma of the past bad choices we've made but suffering also has collective roots sometimes the suffering that we engage in this life is not because of anything that we've done personally but it's because of where the collective is where the herd is it's it's a suffering which is generated by a common denominator of the of the learning of the human species we are just in the early stages of of really understanding the full power of our nature of our true and essential nature and the goal of this access to this deep nature is not simply to be happy and and to be relaxed and to be comfortable but it's literally to to transform our experience of being an incarnation of spiritual being so that the goal is to increasingly change the conditions of our life so that we are literally living not only a spiritually relaxed and comfortable and and and good existence but that we are able we are gradually changing the conditions of our physical existence uh I think they'll in the future we will see uh we will have more control over our body's diseases and more ability to intervene in the diseases of the body and to produce a healthier and healthier body i think we'll be seeing all sorts of traits that we consider miraculous becoming increasingly natural and manifest and I think when we come to this pivot when we go through the pivot that I think we're coming into you know I have a chapter in the book on the birth of the future human I think we have entered a a really critical pivot point in the human story we are being taken into the next level of our human evolution uh I think we will see a significant amelioration of our collective suffering as we make this transition i think we are going towards a period where individually and collectively a world of less suffering a world of greater joy a world of greater spiritual empowerment uh and physical ease as we go forward and as we go through this transition this is just the next iteration of an evolutionary story which has been going on for hundreds millions of years billions of years and will continue to go on for millions billions of years for so in order to understand why we suffer we have to if we really want to understand we have to go very very deep we have to go deep into the divine intention we have to go deep and open up a very very large vision of history even if we're going to begin to have a chance of understanding why existence is so hard well if I could follow up um with a related question the the previous question was sort of the paradox of the necessity of suffering and as compared to the goal of establishing uh more of a paradise on earth another paradox to me seems to be the idea that you've expressed that consciousness is fundamental it's primary it's it's the foundation of all uh existence and yet it's through a chemical substance that you got there which would lead a lot of materialists to say see ahu it's consciousness is nothing more than a product of chemistry yeah and the same thing happens if you just sit on a meditation cushion for long periods of time and become an increasingly proficient uh and in that form we can now monitor the brain wave patterns and we can even explore the biochemistry of meditative states of consciousness and we can say the same thing see it's biochemistry and electrical you know waveforms in the brain which are actually inducing this but that really kind of uh doesn't really solve the problem does it because uh it that that is the application of a particular metaphysical worldview of materialism and there if we want to probe that worldview we can find lots of counteremon that's an inadequate worldview it was an adequate worldview in the 18th 19th century when we got into it but it's not an adequate worldview to handle the wide range of experiences that occur in lots of different contexts parasychological research psychedelic research different you know near-death episode research reincarnation research all of that undermine if you're really paying attention the the plausibility of the metaphysic of the metaphysics of materialism so but it is an ironic thing that we have this chemical substance which interacts with our body in a way that seems to open us to it opens the floodgates of our uh well see I I tend to think of the mind as kind of a more like a transceiver it is a gate controller uh and so it changes the gate structure uh it kind of puts our default mode network and allow into quiescence and it allows us to temporarily have states of awareness that go beyond the default mode network um but it we that kind of mechanism is subject to different interpretations if we apply a m a materialist interpretation or if we imp uh bring to it uh a non-materialist spiritual perspective in which we can understand human existence the way I understand a human being is that we are living at a synthesis we are a synthesis of two different systems to be very si simply between a spiritual reality and a physical reality they are always intertwined we are we are living them continuously if we survive the destruction of our body it's not because of something that happens to us when we die it's because of something that we already are we already are living with one foot in two worlds and we know that if we shift the balance we can open ourselves to that spiritual dimension without leaving our physical body and we can do it through any number of different contemplative practices and yogic practices we can also do it using uh s using some of the ancient uh sacred medicines and the tradition that doesn't prove materialism it just proves again if we start with a model that we are a synthesis of two metaphysical systems then we can explain all the phenomena and more of the phenomena than materialism can explain yeah here's a question from my husband Xander and as humans we have a sensory system and a motor system through which you mentioned it with the brain that's the central nervous system and some refer to that as being a filter of consciousness and he asks if you had sinesthetic experiences what sense or senses were most active so senesthesia where maybe you like hear smells or taste vision or you know I'm not in a good position to answer that question i'm afraid Xander I just u because those kind of experiences are not are not do not figure largely in my experience so I haven't thought about them a lot i haven't studied them very much um I don't when I've taken psychedelics I don't hallucinate on them i mean I'm always wrapped up with eye shades and whatnot but even when I've taken the eye shades off I don't have visual distortions in my world around me if I had stayed in touch with physical reality I'm sure I would have and then I might have had some of the experiences you're referring to but if you internalize your experience completely you engage conscious reality and then you're on a conscious experience and I see many things and I experience many things but I don't experience them as kind of a a permutation or distortion of my physical sensation it's kind of like I just let go of physical sensation and I just plunge into uh the conscious the tunnel of consciousness and go there now I'm sure there's a good answer to your question and I'm sure of people uh maybe even people on this podcast right now who would be able to give you a good answer to that question i'm just afraid I'm not one of them well I think he's had those experiences and that's why he was curious if that's something you you had also experienced yeah yeah the permeability between uh our senses shows up in several different contexts i know it shows up in shamanic drumming for example the the different fluidity there uh we are such a complex being this blending of spirit and matter uh it shows up at very broad levels and it shows up at very micro levels in our sensation yeah yeah here's a question from a viewer named Corey Berdick who asks "What are some of the most powerful or inspiring examples of the emergence of the new human?" [Music] Well I think when we see somebody who's willing to lay down his life for others that's an extraordinary example when we see people who spend their entire life working to help other people and they they they bypass putting their energy towards enhancing their life and they invest all their energy in helping other people live a full and rich life those are symptoms of the of the future human the way I understand the future human I'll step aside for just a second and come back to the focus we've been incarnating for thousands and thousands hundreds of thousands of years we've been incarnating and the pattern in our religious structures has sort of seen a linear development in our reincarnation you know we go backwards we go forward but basically making a linear development in so that we become eventually more compassionate more intelligent more creative so on so forth but I think at least as it's as it's been shown to me and as I've been taken into it I think we are coming to a time of history in general and people individually where well let me just say how it happened to me i reached a point in one of my sessions when all of my former lives started coming into me and I had done years of past life therapy work so I was familiar with some of my former lives but they began to come into me i could feel them entering me and it was like wrapping a filament of white light around a a kite spool and after a certain period they seemed to fuse and when they fuse there was an tremendous explosion of energy and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness in which I was an individual but I was an individual beyond any frame of reference that I had known before and this is what I came to call the birth of the diamond soul or the birth of the soul and then I was given a series of teachings that was explaining what happened what was happening and I think I was being shown that this is what happens to a species that reincarnates as we in reincarnate we come to a point where there's a long period of individual development of linear development but there comes a point where it's just natural that all of our former lives achieve a synthesis of the soul now this synthesis exists in spiritual reality when we die we return to soul consciousness we return to the consciousness that holds all of our former lives and then we incarnate we get narrow we die we get large we incarnate we get narrow and if we keep this up for a few thousands of years sooner or later doesn't it make sense that the soul the whole soul the 100,000year-old being incarnates in a physical incarnation so that the consciousness that lives in that body is not a consciousness that ever is tempted to think of him or herself as a hundred-year-old being but it's it's natural consciousness is aware that is an ancient being and it has ancient relationships with all these beings it has been male female rich poor black white every possible permutation all of those live within us but when they achieve a synthesis when they become one then there is this explosion of identity and I think that this is what is happening to the planet right now we are undergoing a spiritual process where we are transitioning from egoic identity to soul identity we are growing up out of our childish egoic past into a mature self where we are we are learning to we are basically becoming incarnate diamond souls and I think we can see this in some of the great spiritual masters of history that they are different from ordinary people and but the difference is that they are bigger older deeper they are distillation ations of the soul so what are the what are the symptoms of I think the soul emerging in history it doesn't happen like all at once or something dramatic it happens gradually and slowly in diff all sorts of different ways and so the symptoms are when you see people who take the long view who really see the seven generations consider the seven generations of impact of one's actions when you have the wide view when they are naturally their compassion expends extends to whole classes of people when we see the Gandhis of the world or the Martin Luther Kings of the world people who live their lives in service of other people trying to lift other people help other people along you see it in the in the music teacher who's teaching fifth graders year after year after year sharing his or her musical knowledge to give that musical knowledge to others so that they can enrich their life and go forward so I I think we see the symptoms of an older soul or the new human when we see symptoms of great compassion great vision great service selflessness and we can see we can recognize those around us without necessarily understanding what we what we were seeing what we're seeing is the soul emerging in that in that life form in that life being and I think that we are coming to a time in history where we have to grow up into the soul's consciousness and just there's a synergistic relationship as the world is trying to become one to solve the problems that it has generated the soul is trying to become one and because we have the history of the world inside our soul as the world ch basically deals with all the ways it's divided life into bits and pieces and preferring some people and dis discouraging other people we have all these tensions inside of us and so that there's a synergistic relationship between us trying to become one and whole within ourselves and the world trying to become one and whole and I think we are being guided into the transformation which will not be easy i think it's going to be very painful where we're going but we are coming into labor we've been just dating the future human for hundreds of thousands of years gestation is long labor is short and I think we're coming into labor we have to deliver the soul into history we have to grow up and I think we will i mean I think we will make this transition a lot of serious people think that we won't that it's we're in we are an extinct species we're just living on borrowed time but my experience is that we do make this transition we will make it it will be very painful but we will give birth to the soul in history well that's beautifully put and uh it's probably a good note to close our live stream on chris it's been a real joy to be with you emmy do you have any concluding thoughts i just want to say thank you for the hope and inspiration and it sounds like you possibly were given precognitive information in your LSD sessions and that you have some type of wisdom or knowledge not only for yourself but also for the collective and because you're right there are a lot of people who feel like we might be devolving and things are going really south i'm not thrilled to hear about the pain coming up but uh hopefully we can take some of these spiritual practices and maybe ameliate some of that i think we can I think we can either go through this kicking and screaming and hurting a lot or we can go through it being more proactive uh with more foresight and and in a cooperative relationship with what's coming and what I've been describing is nothing unique to me it these ideas about the transition comes up in indigenous people's tradition it comes up in the lives of mystics and meditators so you know it it comes up in those who work in deep yungian you know type of psychotherapy there's nothing unique to my perception there's nothing really unique to psychedelics about it it's just that I think there are precognitive aspects to this type of work which is when you let go of your personal identity you open to the life of your species and just as you can have insights into your personal trajectory you can also have true insights into this trajectory of your species it's just a very natural thing and many people have had these insights many people see what we're coming into and I think we will make it and I think my concern is how many of our children would die before we make it well and it's nice to hear more people such as yourself bring these insights so the more spiritually evolved people we have it sounds like the better which is perhaps one of the main reasons we continue to do these programs on new thinking aloud yeah I think there are many bodhicattas in the world including the people behind this program working on behalf of the good of the whole that's the essence of the bodhicattva and there are many with us now today well once again Chris uh thank you so much for being with Emmy and I and with the

      <p>hi chris hello richard here we are here we are yes made possible only with new technology exactly me in north carolina in the usa are our guests from all over the world i see yep absolutely and and also the magic of you know even though we're doing this now um many other people will be watching this in another now and i want to welcome all the all those people in all of those nails yeah all those different timelines yes it sure has been fun having this dialogue with you sharing ideas and perspectives on reincarnation i've really been enjoying it me too me too it's i've learned a lot from you and uh and you know since i read your book um it really you know a book that really blew blew my mind um and had so many resonances for me diamonds and you know lsd in the mind of the universe those who haven't heard about that yet it's quite something um chris's book so i recommend that heartily right at the beginning here and and the the exploration that it's afforded us um and the overlaps with my work with the gene keys so a real pleasure real pleasure yeah and we're we're also um you know it's an ongoing journey for us isn't it so we we we haven't finished this is just us sort of getting going i think so i think we're probably going to explore this subject in the coming months and perhaps years and and keep diving deeper into it and yeah mining the insights that we that we can and also involving um a community of people to to engage with us like this today yes yeah that's going to be fun i look forward to that if we can get into as much trouble as we got into with three hours just imagine what we could do with more time exactly help it yeah yeah so um i mean we might as well just jump straight in we've we've got a load of questions that have already been sent in so the plan here is we're going to um chris has and i've sort of sorted the questions that you've sent in uh into categories and we're going to kind of riff through them first because they they cover broad um a broad kind of area of subjects connected to reincarnation and thank you by the way all those who send in your questions they've really helped us to um kind of sharpen and that and and some of those questions lead to more questions and um you should know that we don't know the answers to some of those questions as well and um but we're going to explore them together so um so we'll do that first and then we'll come round to the live q and a questions um that you can put in to the little q a button down here if you've got any point you have a question you can drop it in there and hopefully we'll be able to get to as many of those so we have 90 minutes um so a lot to you know a lot of time to explore well you know we broke up the questions there were so many good questions and we could spend hours and hours just on the questions that have already been sent in there were so many good questions we broke them up into clusters and so we thought let's go through some of the ones in the first cluster just to read some of the questions so that the participants can get a sense of the types of questions that people were asked to move to ask after they listened to our dialogue and then we can just touch on a few of those and then move into the second cluster of questions the first cluster we identified as how can we acquire personal knowledge of our former lives because it's one thing as many of you noted to have someone tell you about these things it's another thing to do your own research and to investigate these things and then it's another thing still to have personal experience of your own former life history so let me just hit a couple of these questions and then one was how can we get closer to completely trusting the universe and that reincarnation is true if all we have is book knowledge on the topic or stories from others and another person wrote is it possible to have a connection with your previous lifetimes in your present life in another can you give us a practical method that allows us to remember our past lives and see the lessons that are working we are working on in our present life and what needs healing in our present life now just to touch lightly on these just to start on these three questions maybe and then one last one was have each of you personally experienced an awareness of your past lives leading to the present and was it beneficial for you to do so okay it strikes me that this whole question of can we trust this material how can i get closer to this material how can i begin to experience these things for myself it's a it's a really important question i personally started to accept reincarnation on the basis of research on the basis of people's uh research and i think this research is abundant there's a lot of wonderful books it's just deserving of our close attention but it's another thing when you start to have personal experience of your own lives when you do the work when you go inside either through contemplation or hypnosis or some form of past life therapy and you begin to follow your own memories back into your earlier memories and to begin to have this vivid experience that your consciousness is bigger than your body it's older than your body it has a longer history than your body and that does tend to cause this this idea to live in your heart differently than before don't you think richard absolutely you know one of my favorite questions in there was once i know about the soul that gathers all my lives into one what are some practices to help me embody it in my present human life you know because we're talking about contacting the energy of the soul you know contacting the energy of of the part of us that's eternal you know and that's like that's a journey you know it's a journey we're all on and most people listening to this uh are very certainly on um otherwise you wouldn't be here i'm sure um so yeah it's that's the first thing that could to contact these realms and to discover or come across um wisdom that's that's buried somewhere inside you and and i firmly feel that this these memories are actually held in the physical body in the physicality of our body so right now begin with that begin with the knowing that or even the premise that inside your physical body somewhere are memories held and um and so this is going to involve some work with the physical body in some form um some relationship with the physical um with breathing with awareness with mindfulness with as you said chris with contemplation and um you know there are there are lots of ways and there are lots of techniques and tricks and things that can help you and but rather than kind of give lots right now um i'd rather just give a very broad guidance which is for me is if you're keen to know more about your own story beyond this lifetime and that can be forwards or backwards um then start really listening and to to really listen you need to clear space in your life so you need to have a practice i would say of listening or of contemplation or of meditation or perhaps of prayer or perhaps of you know anything that begins to enhance and increase that awareness of those other frequencies beyond the body and and so finding the ones that really work well for you the techniques that really feel good to you and resonate with you is going to be a good indication that that's a good technique to begin to open up the inner world and then begin to create the space so that the and you can put out the the question i'd like to know more that's it you know it's already in you if you're if you're here it's probably already in you i'd like to know more i'd like to remember more and what you're doing is you're really reaching out into the ethers of the cosmos and you're inviting a revelation or a series of revelations and and that's going to be a journey as it has been for chris and myself and we've gone very different ways you know chris is and chris's root towards this has been very different from mine you know and uh and so you have to follow begin with begin with what feels right what you resonate with um and then the rest will begin to open up inside you um you i mean you've had more experience i think chris with the um past life therapy community than i have so i maybe that you could give a few pointers in that well you know when one of the questioners asked do we have any practical suggestions for techniques that can help people and discover their former lives and i don't want to go in that direction this is there are no shortcuts here there is a matter of living with this information and then also there is the systematic exploration of your deep consciousness which is just a matter of following your your memories to earlier and earlier stages and this is can be done with contemplation as richard said in various meditation exercises but then i think it's also can be greatly aided by working with professionals who can who can help you stay conscious at deeper levels of your memory than you might ordinarily be conscious of because often when we go beneath our personal unconscious we tend to get fuzzy and maybe fall asleep but someone can help you keep focused as you go deeper and deeper and it's often good to focus on a particular issue or problem or joy and follow that to its root as you go deeper within but there are many ways inside some people's memories are activated on a massage table some people's memories are meditated and medi activated in meditation but once you begin to appreciate that your being is older than your body and live with that idea every day it just becomes increasingly natural to live in a world that's saturated with time to live in relationships that are saturated with time and and with life projects it it makes less and less sense to try to compress everything that's going on inside us into one lifetime and more and more sense to let it unfold into a larger agenda yeah so another good tip is don't be in a rush don't take your time take your time you have all the time you need to explore this amazing mystery and the subject that we're opening up here is not just about reincarnation and rebirth it's it's it opens up into into all all other questions all the deep questions like what are we why are we here how does it work you know all those deep questions that we have inside us that we carry um how can we be eternal how can we know how can that work and then we're here all those those things and um in the work i do with gene keys as many of you will know um have this infuriating habit of pointing people back into them their own wisdom because if you can begin when you can begin to access the wisdom that lies inside you and it's and as i said start with your body with the physical um and begin to you know begin to kind of explore what's inside you and who you are and begin to work through some of the issues and the shadows and the trauma that you hold and begin to forgive and begin to let go and surrender and go through this process of transformation of inner transformation which is a whole journey in itself as as everyone here will know then you start to open up space inside for your wisdom to appear and your memories to appear and they will tell you exactly what you need when you need it not before not after just exactly when you need it the wisdom will come the memory will come if it's meant to come and it'll come in the way it's meant to come so for some people are very visual some people are kind aesthetic like you go to a place you're like i know i've been here before or you meet a person and you and you look in their eye and you know you've met them before those kind of things or it could be um it's just a it's visual inside your cortex you know that you see it or there's so many different ways or it could be a smell or it could be through any of the senses um or just an attunement to synchronicities that are going on around you you know and as we get more heightened and more aware of these other realms we begin to pick up on this interconnectivity um that lies beyond this world this this world that we are used to inhabit inhabiting you know and we realize there are other dimensions and we begin to resonate with those dimensions and that's what we call wisdom you know when the when our when our world begins to open up and that clarity starts to come through from those other dimensions and it informs this dimension we're living in in some expansive way in some therapeutic virtuous way inside us in in some you know in some process of opening and that's so that's really you know if you have these questions um whatever they are know that you know the journey is always you know one of going deeper and deeper inside the question itself and sinking right down into the heart of it and because it's a very valid question if you hold it and it probably has another question hidden inside that and then another one inside that and then begin to open up and open up and open up so i want to kind of say that as a as a way of empowering everyone to to trust in their own in your own intuition and follow the threads you know through the labyrinth yeah yeah yes shall we pull a couple of questions from the nuts and bolts section yes section category nuts and bolts basically how does reincarnation work you know some of them are long answers some of them are short answers here's a few that could be answered quickly do we stay in one ancestry do we hop across to others we hop you know do we think our next reincarnation could be as our children or us our grandchildren and there's research that says yeah could be you know people reincarnate in families and another person asked are animals part of the reincarnation cycle and the answer that i think in all reincarnation cultures they say yeah animals are part of the cycle but they tend to be at the earlier stages of one's reincarnational lives because once you have gone through a certain level of cognitive development that you can function at a human level there's not too much to be learned from going back and living lives as an animal so they're part of our heritage but not necessarily we don't incarnate from a human to an animal even though that's a very popular folk belief it's not really it's not really a belief held by more informed thinkers of reincarnation do you want to pull a couple of questions from that list yeah and and actually i'd like to go back to the one about ancestry because um i was recently talking to this um wonderful man tyson juncker porter who's an aboriginal um indigenous man and he was talking to me about um in a kind of interview we did together um kind of informal one we were talking about um transmigration of souls and and in many indigenous cultures there are kind of um they track their incarnations and they have a there's a strong intuition held that within a tribal grouping or a family grouping or a clan that's close that's close-knit that's operating like in those cultures then there's a there's a real link between one's own person and the great grandchildren or the great grandparents so it skips a couple of generations but they see um their great grandchildren as the as the next wave coming through and there's all kinds of cross-patterning within that um and there's no kind of fixed way of understanding it but it does seem to be a strong firm tradition so and and recently for myself my father died recently and i've been going through all of his ancestral things and i found photographs of my great grandparents as it happens and um and i and i haven't um this is before i knew i'd spoken to tyson and heard this i have an uncanny resonance to them that i can't explain and i it just came to me and i've and i intuitively just put their photographs on my desk and out of all the photographs that i looked at of ancestors and people like that those are the two that i really wanted to look at and so i put them on top of my desk and they've been sitting there looking at me for the last few months or months or so and so there's something in that i believe and um and i think it's interesting that yes it follows it does tend to follow through family lineages but it also hops about um and there may there may be a deeper storyline to that that um we could go into another time but um yeah i'll hook another question out sorry i kind of wanted to touch that one um there was also one about wounding which was from the past um one which i thought was important not to miss um about healing trauma in the body and i think it connects to some of the further later questions which are um about the nature of incarnation and and how we um you know what it really what it means to be in one of these and um the way i understand it through the work i do uh is that you know as as you so well put chris you know we're we're kind of moving on now from this up and out philosophy of like um we have to get you know we have to attain this enlightened state and then we're out and we're beyond samsara and we're moving on to another plane um and i speak more about being down and in you know that the more work we do internally inside ourselves to clear patterns to transmute shadows to forgive and let go of trauma um for the physical emotional mental body of our being then the more space there is for us to incarnate more deeply so it's like our soul is is a vast thing it's vast it exists in another dimension most of us not here most of us haven't incarnated actually and and so the more that work we do inside this inside our being and particularly i bring up deep focus to the belly to the navel which is where everything seems to cluster so that as you clear your being then more light can can actually come in and live here and and more you know you begin to radiate more you begin you you begin to unlock more of that joy and more of that um healing energy that's inside you more of that trapped energy because more of your soul can can come here you know it's a bit like you know that's how heaven comes to earth through us doing this shadow work and then more of us incarnates so i wanted to say that because it felt like really important connection between trauma and incarnation so i'm going to let you take it from there well let me toss a couple of these questions here one of them i thought two of them stand out to me one is why do we forget our past lives in the first place and the variation on that question is if we are all eternal immortal and infinite what is the point of reincarnation in a different physical body could we not all live eternity different experiences places and people in one body and uh when i've been talking about this to my students i ask them to imagine imagine that you are the creative intelligence of the universe and you wanted to design a system to maximize uh accelerated learning accelerated development and you had two scenarios you could create a body that would live a hundred thousand years and then set them loose in the world to gather a hundred thousand years worth of experiences and you could plan b would be to create a body that lived 100 years and every hundred years you pull it out and then you plug it into the system in a different body a different gender different sex and different you know role in society at the end of a hundred thousand years which of those two systems do you think would produce the most evolved being and i think we'd recognize quickly that it's the the one that has discontinuity because discontinuity leads to greater variety greater variety leads to more accelerated learning and so the reason we forget our former lives is precisely i think so that we can completely immerse ourselves in a new set of circumstances that are different and it's the differences that make them challenging to us and those differences basically accelerate our learning process that said there comes a time i think when the soul begins a process of not simply differentiating and gathering differentiating and gathering but a process of bringing in bringing those lives together and when we begin to assimilate the lives that we have led what often occur would manifest in our lives first are the pain or the problems left over from these other incarnations the tensions and stresses but as we continue to work with those we we begin to tap into i think also the assets of those lives the virtues and and the capacities that those lives have and see i think much of our discussion of reincarnation is influenced by the past life literature and the past life literature is a therapeutic literature where people come to therapy because they're they're carrying a pain but i think most of our past lives don't manifest as pain in our present life most of our past lives manifest as capacities as skills as knowledge as as a capacity to do things and know things so we have to be careful not to get our our understanding tilted just towards the pain that that's a figural part but it's also all the other things that are [Music] latent in those lives so there comes a time when we begin to integrate those lives and begin to bring them together and that's a sort of a different stage than earlier when we were going out and seeking new and different experiences and i think we are coming at a time in history where the emphasis is on in degrading our past not simply pushing the boundaries of our past into new territory yeah that's a great point chris and i think you know as what we were talking about earlier um you know that what's being processed on an internal level then is manifesting externally as well by the way be careful of your mic because sometimes it's scraping um and so what we're seeing in the world is we're seeing the after effect of an inner transfer transmutation that's taking place through the through the group soul of humanity the group consciousness and um yeah those i was looking at that question about um you know are there parallel universes to incarnate into and it made me think of um you know when you know when a soul evolves to that level of beginning to kind of you know beginning to transmute more of the karma of the of the world or of the you know of it of the suffering of the world there also is a more there's a seems to be a greater elasticity available to that being to that to that aspect of consciousness so there's a little bit more play and that means that there's more um ability to travel to kind of transmigrate between dimensions and to be able to kind of break some of the rules of the linearity of incarnating sequences you know because there's this like idea that there's time and we're moving with like we're stitching this beautiful cloth this fabric through coming in and out of lives like that and i think that that i think probably there are many lives where we do do that but i think as we gain in wisdom and soul evolution sorry excuse me um then we begin to kind of reach a a higher velocity or higher frequency where time is more is more flexible for us you know so some of you asked like questions like about do we have specific do i have specific memories of past lives and and i kind of i i do in a way um and i also don't because um there's a part of my mind stream that doesn't wish to cling to locations in the space-time continuum because there's a playfulness i find in the way that my mind operates it it reads the whole stream or it reads a whole fractal or a whole pathway in a passage down a lineage and then it feels a resonance somewhere and then it follows another one and it feels a resonance there and they're forward and backward in time you know so they're not just historical they're more mythic um and so there's more of a there's more of an interdimensional play the more experienced let's say a soul and a soul essence has gained and i think that's kind of um that's where we can cross over into other dimensions and perhaps um even travel with beings from other dimensions um for periods of time so um and have connection and connectivity and memory of beings in other dimensions or awareness of sometimes twins even kind of like a twin energy in another dimension um and and that can appear to us in many different ways and i i've heard a lot of stories down the years of people who have that kind of um feeling you know that they carry that they carry that they're not alone there's something traveling with them and and whether they give that a name or not um it's something that's sort of that they're participating in another kind of level of experiment so i i i think there are so many layers and intricacies within this woven tapestry of time space you know and what's clear is that in our talk chris we decided we started to explore this notion of deep time uh where you begin to kind of step outside the space time dimension and then you know 10 000 years on the earth can pass you know as a single stitch in time out of the form that's an almost instantaneous so we we have that idea that oh i may not you know it's like one of my last incarnations i feel is quite a long time ago and um and so that might seem like oh i've been waiting around in some other plane for a long time but actually that was that could at that time was instantaneous you know so it was just a bigger loop in the stitching rather than lots of little ones it was like a bigger loop within the time continuum and then also there's this idea that you can then go the other way as well you can go forwards and take leaps and loops forwards in the stitch in the weaving of of this journey that we're on and you can begin to that the wider that your your evolutionary lens becomes the more collective it becomes the more of the tapestry and the fabric of reality or of space-time you can see so it's like you're no longer just doing a little stitchy you know pattern in the fabric that you've been making for you you then suddenly see a whole section of the weave that's been created and you suddenly see your place in that oh i did that little stitch there where i was part of that and then and then it's like you pan out and you're it's it's fast beyond comprehension um because there are so many beings and they're all one being and they're all weaving this incredible tapestry together and it's within this this vibrating rippling fabric of space time so there's a lot of play in here as well and uh and i think it's important to have to kind of open one's heart to that you know yeah beautifully said richard beautifully yeah i you know reincarnation answers certain questions but in many ways uh it it really it's kind of changes the direction of the questions that we're asking it just opens us to a much more complex universe where we don't necessarily know the rules of where everything is going where it's heading but we can begin to explore it with a different set of hypotheses a different set of assumptions you know there is one question that we put into this category i would like to make sure that we that we get to and that is the question about suicide because it obviously comes from a very deep place and one person asked what happens with the soul of a person who commits suicide right and uh so if i'll i'll just throw something in and then hand it to you but in a reincarnating universe where nothing is eternal everything is constantly changing and we're learning in incremental bits suicide is just one more episode of learning it it's not a mortal sin it's not doesn't lead to eternal damnation there are many many reasons why people may take their lives and we may call them all suicide but they're not all the same kind of suicides they have very very different motivational structures but even if we're dealing with a suicide that comes as an act of desperation or an act of almost cowardice we might say if it were that even that kind of act it is greeted by the universe with understanding and with compassion when we die and we begin to go through the life review and we debrief our life with the other levels of intelligence and beings of intelligence that surround us i mean let's face it life inside time and space is hard it's challenging and people get themselves in all sorts of boxes and dead ends where they they get desperate but even acts made in desperation do not have eternal consequences and we are not punished for such acts we are we are met and we have to learn from them it's important i mean all of our actions can become habitual so anger can become a habit a character trait suicide can also become a habit that shows up in multiple incarnations so it's important to confront the limits that led us to such a desperate act and find out how to bring that those limits to a different outcome to bring our life into a different outcome but it certainly certainly i don't think suicide leads to anything like this perpetual estrangement from the intelligence of the universe or the love of the universe your thoughts richard you know i was thinking how suicide is almost um it's always almost loneliness taken to its far far extreme isn't it you know where it's become so unbearable you know that that's the only option you feel there is um and so that's a very human condition you know it's it as you said it's like it's absolutely understandable that we feel at times deeply lonely and sometimes the conditions that surround us are so difficult and challenging that you know one can empathize empathize with that and um and i think you're right i think you know in in one of the um recordings i did recently that i shared with you was um and it's i think we're going to put a link to it it's the the i called the rebirth sequence and the and it's it's sort of these stages of moving from uh dying and going through these bardo stages and but very simply laid out and the final stage is called i call the arms of the mother and it has various levels to it but the arms of the mother is that that's what you land in um at when you've gone through those sequences those that life review and you're coming into that place of self-forgiveness you know because you are forgiven but you have to forgive yourself and that includes also not just you know that includes acts of of aggression and violence towards others or it could be things like murder you know and you know terrible things that take place on this earth plane so the view from without you know outside the human this human plane into from the arms of the mother is not as you said it's not about revenge or retribution it's simply about reconciliation and transmutation and a lot of the time it's about forgiveness self-forgiveness you know we we have to at some level the soul has to learn from whatever it's done and then absorb and integrate that and forgive and move on and become stronger through it and that's what this whole reincarnating pathway journey is offering us so if you really tune in deeply like you have chris and your journeys into the you know into the into the field of wounding and uh in in your book as you describe you realize that you have done we've all done atrocious things you know in our history we carry the memory of of terrible deeds that we were party to or part of or on the victim side of and and carry and all kinds of levels all inside us i mean i i have a hunch that a lot of that memory is co is in the non-coding dna in our body you know the the so-called junk dna that that that forms almost 90 percent of of our dna that's that's not we can't understand we can't see that it cut what it codes for um and so somewhere in inside here are all those those memories of of places we've been people we've been things we've done and isn't the the most beautiful insight that arises from that from an incarnating worldview that we are always forgiven you know we we love we you know and knowing that you know that it it opens up the the journey of the higher soul you know because then the soul begins to experience itself as light as as a christ impulse or a buddha impulse and it begins to kind of really become a beacon and wishes to help others and be of service and enter into that higher evolution and that seems to me to be the natural progression of the deep and you know that deep kind of encounter with the nature of what we call evil or or you know or sin you know and and that is like the or suffering you know that is the edge that that helps us become better people better beings you know more beautiful beings ultimately through self-forgiveness and forgiveness of others and um and it but it takes a wide it's a big it's a big stretch for some people that i understand that it's a big stretch so yeah yeah the forgiveness of ourselves and forgiveness of others but also restitution there's nothing that we've done that we can't repair that we can't make better because we have opportunity we have time we can change our past by changing our present and by moving forward we can make restitution we can help we can bring healing where we brought injury before yeah maybe i'm very much aware that we have many questions that are stacking up in the q a but i know that we wanted to touch briefly on the coming shift because for a couple of questions about the coming shift let me just mention a couple one person wrote i feel very worried about the changes ahead that you spoke about and wonder if you could offer a sense of hope to those of us who are struggling and another person said i think this shift that you are discussing can happen in as soon as 20 years so very different kind of takes on this and i think there is um i i think there is great grounds for hope and it's not not the hope that we can avoid the suffering that's coming at us so that we can change it but uh the hope based on trust and trust on the intelligence of the universe and that the intelligence that had brought us through the oxygen crisis billions of years ago and the intelligence that gave us the 50 increase in the size of our brain 200 000 years ago and the intelligence that we see bubbling up underneath us all over layer after layer in the natural world that intelligence has brought the human race to this point in its story where it is basically forcing us to shed the limitations of living at a level of awareness of just our private egoic body mind awareness and the summons is to live out of a deeper soul awareness with a deeper set of our felt connection to other beings and to other species and to the planet as a whole and to life as a whole i think there's tremendous grounds for hope but the kind of hope that is not the hope and the avoidance of pain and suffering but the type of hope that's born in the middle of pain and suffering out of a deep deep conviction that there is a a deeper intelligence expressing itself we may not be able to see the full parameters of this intelligence but we can we can have the confidence that this tele intelligence is functioning here as it does function in other areas of life exactly and and that that intelligence is essentially benevolent you know it it is it has it has that it you know its highest as i described just now it's like it through suffering it comes to know its higher nature you know and so as we experience that as individual souls so as more and more of us begin to come to that point inside our inside our our own souls evolution then the whole of humanity begins to come towards that realization that we are actually one being here doing this you know and and so we see this externally through the through the way we our world now operates through the internet and through you know this this global connectivity that we now have and yet we also see all the shadows through that more clearly than we ever have and but we're also we have the capacity potentially to kind of heal the situation more than we ever have because we have this connectivity and humanity seems to kind of need to drive itself to the edge of a precipice sometimes it seems to be a pattern i again talking to the indigenous people i've been talking to recently you know they say you know in their memory banks their racial memory banks are oh this has happened you know many many times you know that we've come to crisis and uh and and they're talking millions of years even you know their memory banks go a long long way and um so you know sometimes we have to come to these crux points in order for there to be enough of a kind of energy shift for us to push us you know to push us over and through and uh that's not a it's not a pleasant situation and it and as that energy builds more and more towards that we will collectively feel more and more uneasy in our in our sort of body biome however in the soul awareness that you know as we as we expand into that more and more deeply and into that trust that field of trust that's underpinning the whole process and that's underlying creation that then begin that can then begin to inform our biology and and and it really does you know that i know that chris and myself we both feel deeply safe in this world even as the world begins to move closer and closer towards what looks like a kind of you know armageddon type scenario but there's this underlying benevolence and as you say chris intelligence that is that is preparing us for this quantum leap and um we have to kind of really sink into that trust field and that that is embedded in the eternal nature of our soul um so this journey into kind of expanding our awareness of the incarnating universe and humanity is really really important because it opens up first of all opens up the mind to begin to like play again like you know this is like when we were teenagers the teenage mind loves this realm you know and and for many of us when we went into our kind of 20s and 30s then because of the way we condition mentally intellectually by the materialistic viewpoint many of us then these kind of conditioning uh paradigms fall over us like like a kind of heavy cloak and so it's it actually can be a great fun and a huge relief to kind of shed some of that stuff and it doesn't mean we're shedding science and all this wonderful um revelations it just means we're opening up to a deeper kind of set of possibilities and and the mind then kind of can go wow anything really is possible you know we do live in a in a you know in a magical universe where yeah we can't understand everything yet you know and but you know science is very slow in its kind of methodical processing it moves at its own pace but the mind can really expand and and open up to to great vistas and that that's the first stage i think in in beginning to kind of feel safe inside oneself again so i want i really hope that that's uh a part of the journey that um we can help build chris here together by continuing to map these other realms yeah yes very much so we're committed we're committed we're here and you know one of the things i talk about in terms of this coming era is the birth of the diamond soul in history and i think actually the conversation that you and i are having here with all the people who are gathered with us is a small part of that process to become because to become aware of reincarnation to become intellectually and in your heart aware of this larger story that's playing itself out inside your life when you become aware of something you give permission for that thing to manifest more deeply into your life so to become aware of reincarnation to become aware of the soul and that the dynamics actually i think it facilitates the emergence of the diamond soul in your own awareness in your own being and i suspect this awareness can come in slowly for some people and in some circumstances and it could come in dramatically and with sort of stunning effects in other circumstances but it's it's all coming in and to be conscious of something consciously of the possibility actually facilitates this deeper integration uh taking place shall we shift to some of the uh the questions coming in from our live audience yeah before the money that we haven't touched on no before we do that i want to just nail a couple of the gene keys questions oh yes yes a bit more specific to me um you know someone asked and i have been asked this before like uh this this this notion that of walk-ins of like a being that comes into um a body and kind of supersedes it in some way um and you know some people say look if i've had an experience like that and i was completely changed after that experience i was a new person and you know should i study a different genki's profile you know and from that date and what i'd say is that um it's important to have both um because you know it's it's uh it's like um you need the old root stock you know it's really important to have the root stock and then if there's a new kind of hybrid that's come in those two have to harmonize together so you can use both and you can explore both and that's an added complexity for you but it's also a rich journey to explore so play with that as you wish i would say and there's also a question about gene keys one's gene keys which are these algorithms that kind of determine our our kind of awakening journey and our incarnation and its themes um you know they do they is there a continuity between them absolutely i would say that there is a continuity between uh sequences but you don't have the same sequences and well you might through through you know some kind of slight of hand of the creator or whatever but it's not this you know that there's a there are there are patterns woven within the matrix and the numbers that if you were able to really look at different lots of different like lifetimes you begin to see these patterns and sequences but they're not always like obvious and clear i can i can feel them and as when i used to do um human desire i mean not human design but when i used to do genki's readings for people and human design readings um i would see all these patterns um between people and their families and their partners and their loved ones and you get to see recurring numbers and sequences so you know and it's really really a lot so you get to see wow this stuff that is so densely woven these patterns and the fabric of these numbers that um it's showing me something that is not just kind of kept to one lifetime it actually continues on it's the in there these threads that like i said earlier that we're weaving so yes there are continuities um more on that at a later date i think but um yeah let's let's move to some of the live questions so many good questions here i'm just scanning through the list of so many wonderful questions we're going to need more time richard uh one touches me here says why do you suppose that souls reincarnate for short periods of time like the infant that dies just after birth or a young child that dies very young these are great heartaches of course for any parent or anyone who experiences the death of a child and i just suggest that things which look very large from inside the time space perspective and from inside the egoic time space perspective from the soul perspective don't look necessarily the same that it it feels it feels tragic for us to have a short-lived life but for the soul they're all short-lived lives a 10-minute life and a hundred year life are all relatively small bits of time against the vast spectrum of the soul's lifetime and sometimes you know some of the past life therapists have engaged souls who have had this experience and they all generally tend to agree that for the most part they are chosen incarnations they chose the incarnation knowing they were getting into sometimes the out the lesson was for someone else it was to see the be the the grain of sand and the oyster that leads to a development of other people sometimes it's but they are chosen they are they are all part of an ongoing and unfolding process and it doesn't mean of course with reincarnation we really have true intellectual permission to really understand that our life does not begin at birth and it does not end at death so we can let go of the heartache i mean there is separation in death and there is separating and there is pain when a life that we wanted to spend a lot of time with we don't get to spend that time with but life does not end at death relationships do not end at death and purpose is not extinguished in death so yeah beautifully answered that's such a tender question as well um so malavika has asked a question about um uh the soul outgrowing gyro and moving on to other systems and um and can the soul determine where it will go when and as what and you know so there's this notion of how much um free will does the soul have and are there other kind of forces at work this is a big deep deep question um i kind of i think we touched on it um a little bit in our sessions but um for me it's that it's that kind of notion of these two forces of involution and evolution and there's evolution where the soul let's talk about it as a soul evolution so the soul is evolving through through its experiences coming in and out of the form and it's getting broader and wider and more aware of its universal nature right and then there's also another force involution which is the arms of the mother you know the whole the mother itself the whole mother ship the whole collective consciousness you know the the god consciousness the divine consciousness that's doing all this through all these these monads these you know these fractals these holographic children you know that are different sort of crystalline aspects of itself but they are it then so the whole is also doing it so there is there's both a kind of choreography from the whole taking place and yet within that there's also this kind of serpentine freedom and flow as the as the crystals the individual crystal souls diamond souls let's call them become more and more aware that they are of what they really are that they are the whole and yet they also exist in the paradox of being a part of the whole how can that both the ocean and the drop how can both of those take place how can that occur that's beyond the mind's capacity to understand in you know that's a paradox and a paradox of of startling truth that can only be known as a kind of as a as a through a bolt of of revelation i would say so both are true you know that we determine where we're going the soul determines but also the mother determines the mothership has its own choreography and dance that we're a part of and it's it's an incredible dance playing with that paradox um that's all i can say is just to lay out the paradox before us so that we can consider it yeah thanks malabika oh i think you're muted chris thank you yep a question from catherine says buddhists say that reincarnation is like transferring the light from one candle to another what do you think of this interpretation this way it can be transferred this way it can transfer both personal and collective karmic stuff i think you know when the buddha was asked a question about what is the self and the self that incarnates so we have many ways of thinking about reincarnation which are not very subtle and not very adequate and many people think of the reincarnation as a self migrating from life to life and when the buddha was asked this question he had a series of candles lined up and he had one lit and then he lit the second one blew out the first one let the third one blew out the second one and pass the candle flame all the way down the line and so then the question is at the end is it the same candle flame or is it a different candle flame and the answer is well it's both but buddhist wants to emphasize it's a different candle flame and it's actually if you get right down to it it's a different candle flame from second to second so the important point here for the buddhism is the teaching of no self that and no self is the teaching not that we aren't individuals that's an often it's a misguided interpretation of it it doesn't mean that there isn't an individuality here what it means is there is no permanent individuality and there is no separate so there is no permanent self which never changes and there is no separate self which is cut off from the rest of existence so that the individuality which is i think the essentials well the center of our individual experience is open it's porous it takes an information and experiences and energy from beings it gives out its own energy and it's not static it's constantly changing over time so i think if we were to take the buddhist example of the candle it would lead to a more subtle description of the categories of reincarnation and that i think is the great value of the exercise it's the subtlety of that description likewise i think that feel theory is very it's a very good set of categories and and metaphors to talk about the soul that that the soul isn't an entity or a thing or a machine or a separate you know nut if we think in souls of souls in terms of feels fields are by definition open they're open at the boundaries there's an easier give and take uh between fields and so yeah good question catherine beautiful answer chris really that was really beautifully put and um really great to have your your um vast knowledge of you know different theologies and here as well brought to the fall um some nishad has asked about the bardo realms which maybe both of us could say something on um and she's suggesting is it possible this life is in bardo so those of you don't know the tibetan buddhist um i think there's only tibetans i think is it only the tibetans that name the bardo chris that's their vocabulary i think yeah so there's this notion of the bardo is the is the transitory um threshold state between lives or it that's one way of understanding it it's the stages as we move from one state to another state and there's a whole description of different you know stages and states that they will describe as we move from birth to death and death of birth and um so there's a transformational process that goes on in there and there's also attachments to those different layers and layerings so um the way i kind of would understand it on a very broad level is that because the another way you could the word bardo has started to be used by western people more perhaps is uh as a to refer to a kind of an impermanent realm a changing realm a transitionary realm or a transitionary world or sphere and so in that from that perspective yes it is possible that the earth is one of those bardos i mean it is one of those experiences that the whole is exploring and it explores these theaters let's call them theaters you know so it explores this theater and there's all these characters and storylines that come together in this theater and all these plays that take place and and the gr and the whole is the audience you know that's that's just watching the whole you know expansion of this process and and the whole or the audience is outside of space and time and yet all the bardos exist within space and time so they are the they are these journeys and theaters and productions you know from hell to heaven and all these you know because there's the heaven realms of the deities and all the bliss realms and then there's the and then there's the hell realms with all the suffering and then there's all the places in between and all of those are in one sense you could say that they are they are bardos experiences um between states and and so yeah it's all a theater as shakespeare said so anyway that's my my my starting though but you might want to add some more of your wisdom well now you say it well it's it is sobering i mean the teaching there are different aspects of the bardo teaching and the word bardo is used in different ways but you know it one of the ways it's used is in terms of the levels of existence unless you say from the lowest hell realm to the hungry ghost realm animal realm human lower deities and higher deity realms that there are these are exist in the cosmos they exist in the spiritual world that lies outside of physical reality and we enter into those various bardos various levels of reality depending upon the quality of our consciousness that we have accumulated over a course of many lifetimes so but then it gets much more intimate when the teacher says all those bartles are taking place right now in the physical world right here right now so there are deity realms there are people who are born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they just seem to everything always goes well with them they're the captain of the football team where everything just kind of breaks their way and there are other people who are living in hill realms and uh everything is changing everything is turning over and then we can get even more intense it reminds me of a story i don't know whether i can remember it completely but there was a samurai who came to a zen master and he wanted to understand the difference between heaven and hell and the zen master basically stood there and he began to insult the samurai and tell him that his clothes were dirty and his sword was dull and he really wasn't wasn't worthy of the name of samurai and the samurai of course had permission to kill anyone that they deemed deserving of death and so he pulled out his steroid and he held it over the the zen master about to cut off his head and the zen master said that's hell and then the samurai recognized the great compassion of the teacher who had put his life at risk in order to give him this lesson and he immediately felt compassion and put away his sword and the teacher said that's heaven so it's not just states that last for an entire lifetime their states that lasts minute by minute we're constantly going in and out of different levels of reality minute by minute then the invitation is what is it that doesn't change what is it that is inside us that witnesses everything and doesn't change as our emotions change as our bodies change as all these things change what is it that doesn't change when we discover that and then we hold that in our awareness while we are living these changes it changes the quality of the life that we're living it just kind of deepens it grounds us deeper into the into the living quality of the deep texture of existence is to live in in god awareness or in the divine awareness or in the in the awareness of the living universe beautiful and thank you for that great story you know it occurred to me that um one of the great modern um clear metaphors for the whole reincarnative story is is um groundhog day you know because that film is wonderful funny film it's so wise it's it it hits something very deep inside us you know and many people have had that same feeling like this is like this repeat of like trying things out in different ways and then trying to take advantage of it and then trying and then becoming hopeless with it and then all the different dramas that get played out in one day you know and and that you could that's the metaphor for here this planet one like one world all those different dramas to play out until you come to create the perfect day you know like the absolute just your perfect day what's your perfect life you know and um and then you're kind of like oh that's that's what it is like you know and and and you've brought it to the you've brought it to the zenith to the crescendo you've perfected your soul within it you know even though you had to go through some terrible things you know and and um yeah so i i like that idea and like because i was you know i know there's lots of other questions but it just came to me as you were talking and um yeah what do you think about that it's just it's a good one isn't it you're muted chris yeah well it is am i on now yeah it is you know here's the here's another good one let me mention this one here sherry writes have had many traumas in this lifetime i'm tired of all the spiritual practices and processing there are so many different ones i have done so much spiritual work this is why i love gene keys and richard's way of teaching i'm at a point of just desiring to be the love i know myself to be and her question is do you think it is necessary to do past life regression i do not have the money to go to those who do this type of work or will we ever just be the love and know that that to be enough and i this has been the flavor of a few of the other questions we received and no i don't think you have to go to past life therapy in order to engage one's karma conscientiously and to heal what needs healing and to deepen what we have an opportunity to deepen what's important is to live one's life well and if you live your life well all the karma from your past that will will come up in your life at some time and circumstance and if you're living your life well you're taking care of business as you go remember that reincarnation has been going on for hundreds of thousands of years and it goes on and it works very well whether or not we know that reincarnation is happening whether we know or believe or understand reincarnation and karma it's still happening it's still been going on it was going on in the 15th century it was going on a thousand years ago or 2 000 years ago what awareness of reincarnation adds it adds an awareness and with awareness we accelerate the process we can speed up the process we can we can stop avoiding things and start embracing more things and as we embrace more things we solve more issues and as we solve more issues we live a more relaxed life a more open and challenging life so no i my two senses i don't think anyone needs to do past life therapy in order to live a very well and satisfying life live your life deeply it's all all your karma is right here around you at the time live it well live it deeply if you want some help getting around a particular issue or getting a particular boulder out of your life well that can be it can be helpful if you can do it but it's kind of a it's an extra great and a lovely question as well you know really beautifully phrased like that the being just is it's enough to just be it is of course it's enough to be that's a that's the most that's the that's the most we can do really you know so i'm i'm very much resonate with that question um there's a question here about old and new souls and um number of souls and you know and and and kind of populations expanding and contracting and it's interesting question and um you know if you think about it like most of the answers lie in nature you know and and if you're observant and you're listening and you're looking and you're really contemplating nature most of the answers are there you know like you're walking through a forest or a wood and you look in there and you see all these plants and trees and there are old trees and there are kind of middle-aged trees and then there are young kind of ones shooting up everywhere and then there are parasite trees and there are all kinds of you know there are weeds and there's you know they're all in there and they're all part of this ecosphere and the same here on this earth you know on gaia we have you know enlightened beings you know we have beautiful beings we have villains and ruffians and vagabonds and we have all the different souls exploring and experimenting we have young ones young little saplings that are still learning that kind of you know maybe get involved in all kinds of difficult things and suffering deep in suffering and deep into corruption um and and and learning and learning through that you know and then there are older ones perhaps who've done all that and they're like here and they're like trying to kind of work more deeply into the collective or into some you know area where they've taken on a lot of suffering you know to to heal either inside themself on behalf of the whole or they're working in service in the service professions or whatever where you know in service in some way so there's all these different you know storylines and threads within the picture and and and sometimes you know the forest dies back in places and it and it's less populous and then there's sometimes when it suddenly expands and it's more and there's and it does it's thriving but they're all phases then none of it's healthy or unhealthy it's just what it is it's just part of the of the the whole theater the tapestry so you know one of the things that the whole reincarnating view the rebirth view really brings to me is this sense of you know amorality you know and that doesn't doesn't take away you know true morals and ethics and you know which are naturally inherent in human beings i believe but there's this kind of it's just going on and there's a journey taking place and we're at some point in that journey right now the collective is in some point right now our individuality is at some point participating in that right now and as i i am i was really sharing deeply recently in the process i'm taking a big retreat thousands of people in the venus sequence where it's a process of healing trauma um emotional trauma especially and um i was saying you know when you heal some pattern inside your own being then you reach out and you heal it in the hole in the collective because it is all just one rippling web one interconnected woven web i mean i seem to be saying the same thing over and over but i really want people to understand you know that yes it's kind of this is this is the theater old souls new souls you know and then there's old cells and maybe yes when you get to a certain stage you have more choice available to you you can leave you can go somewhere else you know it's like you've earned it you've earned enough money to be able to buy a ticket somewhere else further and and it's you know that's the kind of metaphor so but yeah then you might also come back you know and bring your wisdom here so i i think there's a lot of i think there's a lot a lot of you know imagination that is needed when we're entering into this into this kind of territory yes very much so you know reincarnation you have to live with it for a long time and then bring that bring the questions that people are asking to into that reincarnation paradigm and sit with it for a long time to get intimations of the depth the way it recontextualizes and gives a new context for the way we usually think about these things and here's a question that really stretches us a question by jacqueline she and this is a challenging question how can collective suffering be a creative process rooted in cosmic love how can create collective suffering be a creative process rooted in cosmic love that's a hard question just because the sheer skill first it works it's a question that's hard for an individual life how does suffering you know is how is suffering in our individual life compatible with the idea that the universe is compassionate and loving but at a collective level how does collective suffering of the type that we were talking about in our third dialogue in our coming you know our coming challenging period of history how can that make magnitude of that suffering of that magnitude be a creative process rooted in cosmic love and i'm reminded that ramakrishna the great hindu saints said if you want to understand god you must be willing to look evil in the face because evil is not outside the divine but it's actually part of the divine process and suffering is part of the divine process so if we want to understand how any compassionate person wants to reduce suffering and end suffering that's the natural impetus that's what we want and we see suffering as the enemy and it's something we want to stop but when we start to second-guess creation when we start to think there has to have been a better way to do it god you know damn it you know couldn't you have given us everything that you want us to become without dragging us through so many centuries and millennia of pain and suffering are taking us more in the future that's a wonderful impulse but that assumes that we we know what the project is that we know what the agenda is and that we know what is the best way to get to that particular outcome so we would have to ask what is the project what is the the project of cosmic love what are we doing here what is creation growing on this planet earth and could it grow a species of diamond beings could it grow a species of fully awakened beings and fully empowered beings and a species that can create out of the sheer power of the divine consciousness that lives that is flowing in their awareness without having to have gone through some of the ordeals that we have gone through in our long evolutionary agenda this is challenging and i and i on the one hand i want to affirm the compassion behind the question and i want to invite a deep sitting with the scale of creation we have to look at the galaxies and look at the stars to appreciate the scale that the universe thinks on and the scale of the creative intelligence thinks on and look at all the stages of evolution that humanity and all life on this planet has gone through suffering seems to be part of it it's just part of the grit of life that brings us forward now i think we may be coming into a time when we won't have to grow through suffering so much as we have in the past that we i think suffering has been part of the paradigm of how we have grown in the past and it may be that we'll be able to grow out of grace more in the future that we be challenged by creativity not simply by our pain but certainly suffering has been part of the stuff which has brought us where we are and i think where we're going it suffering takes things away from us it breaks us down it doesn't allow us to continue the way we are it forces us to reassess and do and to look at things anew and i think we're coming into a time where in order for something radically new to come into the human story we have to let go of what we have been and letting go of what we have been is hard work and does involve a certain amount of suffering but the sooner we cooperate with this process the sooner we surrender to it the sooner we let it go and the sooner we start taking care of each other with that deep compassion which is rooted in that cosmic love the sooner the suffering ends and the creativity begins i know that's not a completely adequate answer to the depth of this question but it's it's just a piece thank you so much for that i mean i'll add a layer um which is in in the in the book i wrote the gene keys book i laid out um the kind of as i see it the codes of consciousness available to humanity you know and and so you see this through these shadows and these different sh these low frequency shadow patterns that we all you know play out with playing in the suffering and then hidden inside those uh these potential gifts and then even inside those gifts those gifts of the creative flowering the healing if you like of the the growing through that suffering and then out of that comes this this fruit which is i call the cities the 64 cities and this is like um probably where we want to bring our talk to a close with this with this notion of um there's something hidden deep in the in the core of that suffering and it is something so beyond what we can understand now and it's something so beautiful and it's another realm it's another dimension it's another way another field of learning you know and we might call it grace or we might call it bliss and it's another whole and well you could even say we may be entering the epoch in which incarnation itself starts to fall apart and starts to open up and so that we no longer need to move in and out of these forms in the way we did we may one day look back and go oh yeah we used to have to differentiate in that way um because of the shadow and the impetus of the shadow inside us but now we've explored that fully we can sit in these cities these cities are the these these higher states of consciousness these avataric fields of oneness and we can still retain our souls wisdom and individuality and its journeys and its continuation and it's continued adventures but from within a much greater field of understanding and compassion you know and these cities are the are are kind of these buddhic fields um that are opening up for us in the future and i i think it's you know chris and i we set this talk for good friday for good reason in a way it just fell there very beautifully because it's it's this notion of the constant rebirthing of the universe of itself from within itself and um it's just it it you know i was saying recently that it's like if you take the the image of the butterfly you know of what a butterfly is the myth of the butterfly that the uh the allegory the the metaphor of the butterfly it's it's it's do you need any more proof for incarnation for reincarnation than that you know that that right there is is the emblem of what is hidden inside our suffering of what's hidden inside this this thing here and and in this whole journey so so yes i think we're moving into this next phase and it's good to be realistic and it's also good to really expand and open up into that and let your heart really ring out with what's what the what the boundless potentials are inside you of your soul and what happens if you really have worked those shadows through and then the full soul can come in the full soul can come in and that the body would hardly be able to hold it to contain it because the the incredible frequency of the quantum field that's generated from that what we call those cities those and then then we start to be co-creators with the creator because then we're like you know our thoughts become uh all-empowering and we become these children of of god or these children of christ um where we get to play in a much vaster field that field that chris was talking about the galac the galactic level the the universal level would become universal consciousness and we we can kind of interact with dimensions um and paradigms that right now we can't even begin to fathom so um i think there's cause for great hope more than hope certainty really um but we have a few boulders to clear first i well i'm glad you brought in easter because it is good friday and this is a special uh weekend in the christian calendar and i know that you and i have both been touched by christianity by its teaching and by people who have been steeped in christian teaching and we have been christians and we have been hindus at different lifetimes and we have been muslims and we have been aborigines we we have been all the religions of the world and the non-religions and atheists we have we have sampled and and drunk from those wells we have been male and female and in that constant collecting of experience and gathering experience and bringing that experience into higher higher levels of fruition when we encounter figures like jesus or like siddhartha gautama the buddha or like muhammad the prophet when those beings are pictured in art they're always pictured filled with light they have halos around them and light just emanates from their body and they have so much energy in them that they can heal beings with a touch and easter of course is is death and rebirth the the indestructibility of life death and rebirth continually going and also of course the symbol of compassion because this is a being who did not have to suffer but who chose to suffer out of his great love for the world and every mother worth their salt every father worth their salt understands that and would suffer for their children for this those qualities those precious qualities those are the qualities that we're developing those are the qualities that we're bringing in and empowering and empowering as as richard said the the power of the soul the energy of the soul is huge and to be able to internalize the soul we must make our body capable of functioning at that level the way christ was able to function at that level the way the buddha and the prophet were able to function at that level so i think that's i think that's what we're coming to in history at a time when we who have been struggling in the shadows for so many generations are now beginning to come into a time of light a time of of

I mean for for listeners again who don't know like it wouldn't appear as though this conversation is couched in your 20-year Journey your your your your 40-year journey as a as a philosophy Professor um and a 20-year Journey with high dose LSD sessions um and the book that we're we were referring to earlier is your book on those Journeys as well as different in a number of other books um and I'm just curious because what I'm seeing in the world um which is mostly the world that is mediated by a screen at this point um is not the kind of place I really want to be uh both in I don't both in the sense of I don't want to be where it appears we're going I don't want to be a part of a system that does the things that it does you know like the I don't I don't like the fact that I'm a part of this disgusting distorted thing and also what I see from the behavior of the people around me and there's a lot to be said about how social media algorithms and and isolation and mental health crises acknowledged or not are contributing to this but I see a lot of toxic Behavior a lot of toxic people a lot of toxic discussion sort of like draped in this sort of like uh this sort of self-confidence self-righteous almost Machiavellian style like moralism of like the good versus the evil and the good is me and anyone that disagrees is like the violent devil I must cast out and and whatever else and I don't feel good about what I'm seeing about the world and it makes me want to just like Hide Away inside now yeah that said coaching this in psychedelics and looking at it as as a large psychedelic I'm using air quotes for listeners process that's happening collectively on a global scale not just with Humanity but we're although we don't know what the feelings and the thoughts or perspectives are or the birds and the salamanders and the and the whales and whatever you know they're going through that with us so it's like a planet it's like a planetary experience right yeah that when I see these parts of myself in a psychedelic session it's no more comfortable by any means it's equally as ugly yeah you know what I want to hide away from that too and get you know one of the things you talk about in your book is that you we need to learn as a part of the Psychedelic Journey we need to learn how to not turn away from our pain or from that pain I mean like the pain of touching a hot fire we turn away from but this kind of pain that we learn to turn towards it and I'm wondering if you could just that's not a clear question but can you just comment on that yeah yeah you know the starting point of serious psychedelic work is taking complete responsibility for one's own shadow and uh and you just go into a room close the door lock the door you're inside by yourself nothing there but you in your mind and you go into the parts of your being which are at least initially the most daunting the most intimidating the most frightening the ugliest ones we like to acknowledge the least uh you know and but the commitment is there to take that on to enter into it when we see that ugliness being manifested in the world around us by people who are not have not yet taken responsibility for themselves and they they are still in this exterior mode where the the shadow is really outside of them the evil and the Darkness and the really ugly things were outside of them um that's a very different world isn't it and I think this whole process of breaking down this breaking down process that we're going into is basically going to be breaking down that defense that we have to thinking that you know we're the good guys or and the other people are the bad guys and eventually we're going to have to come to terms with the fact that weird we did this we created this imbalance we have benefited from it we are continuing to generate it in the cars we drive and the lives we live and the lifestyles we aspire to we have done this we will we have done it there's going to come a time eventually where there's no place else to look but we have to take individual and Collective responsibility for the pain that is that is alive within us in the lives of everyone around us that really is a pivot point I think when we just stop blaming the other stop blaming previous generations stop blaming so on so forth be really settle in we're not there yet some of us are there yet I mean I think the Psychedelic Community understands these things because that's how you make progress in psychedelic work is you confront the shadow now when you go into the work you know that uh the more you purify the more you cleanse the deeper the reward the deeper the Ecstasy the deeper the teaching so the more you purify the deeper the communion once you learn that not only do you become more comfortable facing the shadow but you actually actively embrace the shadow you active actively Embrace pain and suffering not because you like pain and suffering but for two reasons one is because you've learned that the deeper the purification the deeper the Ecstasy and you don't like to suffer but you like what's on the other side of the suffering but the second thing is you embrace the pain and suffering even knowing that a lot of it is not yours be out of the same compassion that every father has for his children every mother has for her children and every teacher has for all of their children eventually that everybody has for other people and you embrace the pain not counting whether it's yours or somebody else's but because by doing so you are helping somebody you are helping other beings that you may never meet and my experiences has been that if you do that if you are willing to take on more than your fair share of suffering you reap more than your sheer benefit you the universe responds it can't help but respond and I think that's going to be happening with us generationally this generation the Next Generation the generation after that is going to go through suffering more than their share of suffering compared to previous generations and after they stop kicking and screaming and begin to get down to taking it on and just doing it I think they will experience the blessings that come from that deep generosity that that profound existential choice to work with the given even when the given is terrible even when it kind of crushes your personal life but you still dedicate yourself to the good of the whole and in that process something begins to change something shifts inside your person and the more complete the surrender to the process the more complete the commitment to that process I think the deeper and the faster the transformation is in our individual lives and our Collective lives so that as we move deeper into this and come through it I think generationally we will learn what every psychedelic journeyer learns that we confront the shadow there is riches on the other side of this ordeal and there's no other way to get to it uh and in the end you see the irony is you kind of end up where you were in the beginning except you're all cleaned out you're just all sorts of this Gunk is out of your system so you are you and you were where you were before but you literally are living a different life because stuff that you hadn't realized was compromising you and burdening you is no longer there and something new has taken its place I think that's where we're going to be going it's going to take time \[Music\] \[Music\]

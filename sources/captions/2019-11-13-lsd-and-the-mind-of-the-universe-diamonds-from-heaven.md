Welcome hello everybody I'm Jessica DiRuzza

from Trust Psyche and it is such a joy to be able to spend the Sunday together this is

our free monthly try psyche livestream that we host right here every first Sunday of the month

all are welcome so please invite your friends we host a variety of speakers on a myriad of topics

and you can find out more about us at recipe.com and you can sign up for these live streams

at truss psyche comm backslash live stream to participate live and to ask your questions

if you value what we do here today the best way you can support us is by subscribing to our

youtube channel liking this video and sharing it with all of your friends i'm very honored and

excited to present our guest speaker for today Chris Bache who's going to be presenting on his

forthcoming book LSD and The Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven released this November 26.

You can pre-order your copy today through Amazon. Up until the 1700s humans believed that the

edge of our universe ended at the planet Saturn the last visible planet that we can see with the

unaided eye with the invention of the telescope we turned it to the heavens and to our great surprise

we discovered the planet Uranus twice as far out as the planet Saturn our universe doubled in size

then in the 1800s with the discovery of Neptune our universe once again doubled in size then in

1931 with the discovery of Pluto our universe then again doubled in size and now less than 400 years

later from the discovery of Uranus we have the deep space Hubble telescope which shows us that

there are trillions upon trillions of galaxies in our universe for me this is analogous to the

work that Chris has done and his deep exploration of consciousness radically breaking open and

through our cosmology and our philosophy and our metaphysics through the 73 high dose LSD sessions

that he did it over 20 years and began to share with us in his work dark night early dawn steps

to a deep ecology of mind now with LSD and the mind of the universe Chris takes us further into

Diamond luminosity and brings back the diamonds from heaven that he so graciously shares with

all of us here today there couldn't be a more important time for Chris to share his work with

all of us both in the greater understanding and acceptance of psychedelics today but also because

of the psycho spiritual death and rebirth that our collective human species seems to be going through

right now so please help me give a very warm and loving welcome to our beloved friend Chris Bosh

and when Chris is done speaking you each have an opportunity to ask your questions so please

have those ready as that is our favorite and those special part of these live streams thank you

so much for being with us here today hi everyone Thank You Jessica and Travis thank you for this

opportunity to share my work with participants intrapsychic aam it is truly an honor to do so

it's also an overwhelming task because this book covers so many dimensions of consciousness

it covers so many years of work and when I talk about it I have a tendency to get absorbed

naturally into the experience as I'm describing and that makes compressing 20 years of work and

20 years of thinking and writing into a very short presentation really challenging so to me a talk

is the most effective way to get to question and answers so I'll try to keep this contained and

as brief as I can and then save a good half hour at the end for Q&A and we'll see where that goes

maybe even more than a half an hour so I'm going to start with a little bit of background first

of all those are you who know me and some of you don't know me the last person you would expect to

have written a book on psychedelics I was raised in the deep south in Mississippi I was raised

in a middle-class Catholic background I wanted to be a salmon priest early in my life was in the

seminary for three years in high school I studied theology at Notre Dame New Testament criticism at

Cambridge and then philosophy of religion at Brown by the time I had finished graduate school I was

a atheistic Lee inclined agnostic and the 60s had completely passed me by I was not psychedelically

involved in in my college or graduate school at all so I was naive psychedelically and I was an

atheistic Lee inclined agnostic philosophically and then came Ellis team shortly after beginning

my career I met the work of Stan Grof and that set my life on the course that I'm still harvesting

today so first let me start a PowerPoint that I'll be using and then I'm gonna keep this on

only for about 10 minutes and then I'll shift in and out of it again later let me see if I can

get this started here this is what the book will look like and I'll tell you a secret about this

book this is the publishers title LSD in the mind of the universe my title is diamonds from

heaven because diamonds from heaven is a story of a journey what they wanted a more marketable

title and that's LSD in the mind of the universe the beginning of this book goes back 40 years

over 40 years when I had begun graduate school in 78 right then I met the work of stanislav

grof his book realms of the human unconscious turned my life around followed quickly by LSD

psychotherapy he gave me the method and the confidence to pursue the method of exploring my

consciousness and through that exploration to come to know the deep psyche the deep universe

better I want to emphasize that I did this work as a philosopher I was not a therapist I was not

primarily seeking healing though healing did come but I was seeking to understand our universe as

deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness as deeply as I could so a few observations

on method and then we'll kind of go right into the content everyone is aware I think of the

distinction between low-dose psycholytic therapy that stand develops and high-dose psychedelic

therapy low dose psychedelic therapy peels the mind gradually layer by layer in very intense

therapeutic encounters psychedelic therapy is a very different protocol it's a protocol trying

to trick her in the early days who are trying to trigger a near-death experience for people who

had terminal cancer they were trying to heal them but to trigger an encounter with the universe

that would open them to the world that they were about to enter when I began my own work I chose

to work with high doses of LSD primarily because it was simply difficult to get time to arrange

a day of inter journeying with the dual-career marriage and I wanted to make the most out of

every day that I could put into this I thought of myself as basically doing an extended regimen

of psychedelic therapy doing just psychedelic therapy but for a longer period of time originally

psychedelic therapy was limited to a maximum of three sessions and I thought well you could

do three sessions with this work safely you could do it more sessions and do it safely when

I got to the end of this journey and was looking back over sl√°inte I began to appreciate that what

happened in my work was different than what I saw being recorded reported in psychedelic therapy so

different that I thought it needed a new kind of language to describe it so I've chosen the term

psychedelic exploration psychedelic exploration is the method of psychedelic therapy isolation

earphones had headphones music total protection with the sitter the difference is the number of

sessions involved in my case 73 high-dose sessions between 1979 and 1999 I worked for four years I

stopped for six years for reasons that I described in the book and then I resumed for a very intense

10-year process I did this work between when I was thirty and fifty years old I'm now 70 years

old so I've taken a long time to present this work completely candidly to the world partly

for legal reasons and partly because it simply takes a long time it took me a long time to map

and understand all the dynamics of the sessions that unfolded during these years I want to say

at the outset that this is not a methodology that I would recommend today if I were doing it over

again I would be gentler on myself I would take a slower process of engaging the great expanse of

the mind of the universe I would balance high-dose work with low dose sessions I would also balance

working with LSD with working with psilocybin and ayahuasca more body grounded psychedelics for

a variety of reasons all of which I discuss in the book don't have time to go into here I tried

to do this work as systematically and rigorously as I can working as a philosopher I made it a high

priority to make a complete and phenomenologically accurate record of my sessions within 24 hours and

then studied the sessions and the dynamics arcing across sessions and comparing my experiences

to those who were that had been had by other psychedelic journey errs this is a snapshot of

my journal about 400 pages my psychedelic notes that for me are my personal Bible they are the

record of my deepest experiences of the universe and therefore in my life they come before all

other discursive thinking and analytic analysis kept detailed records of my sessions all the way

through I looked at and studied the astrological transits of my sessions trying I was aware of

Rick and Stan's thinking about the relationship between the outer transits the outer planets and

the global transits and how they affect one's work in deep non-ordinary states so I wanted to study

this hypothesis myself and look at how my sessions projected against the rhythms of the solar system

during the years I was doing this work I want to emphasize that the story I'm telling in LSD

in the mind of the universe is not primarily a personal story I mean it is a personal story at

one level but in another sense it's not primarily a personal story this series of curves represents

a series of LSD sessions and I found that after the first 15 sessions or so when I was working

insights and help in my personal life tended to come at the beginning and end of my sessions as

I was leaving and returning to time-space reality that's reflected in these small circles when the

session was in its peak hours represented by the large circles I was usually operating beyond curse

my personal reality beyond Chris Bhatia's reality not entirely but largely and so the story I'm

telling in LSD in the mind of the universe is the story of what unfolded in those large circles

at the peak hours of my psychedelic sessions this is primarily a cosmological narrative it's

not primarily a therapeutic narrative the details the personal details are important in a

therapeutic not work narrative it's not so much in a cosmological narrative I found when I did this

work that what unfolded in my work was a series a multiple series of experiences of death and

rebirth that eventually kind of concretize dinh to this picture the drop below the line that line

is kind of represents the border of time-space the drop below the line is egoic reality our

individual space time consciousness and the first death and rebirth which is the one most

frequently talked about in the literature is ego death which takes place in that first level when

we make the transition from ordinary consciousness into early trance personal consciousness but if

you continue to work and press the limits of your experience I found that there are other deaths

which take place at other levels of consciousness and wife I look Stan Grof in using the vocabulary

of psychic subtle and causal reality to describe some of these deeper levels of consciousness

I don't have a vested interest in how many levels of reality there might be or how many

times the circle of death and rebirth may turn what's important is the principle that if

s one pushes deeper and deeper and deeper if you do this work systematically

there are a series of deaths and rebirths that open in the process

as I have looked back and mapped these circles oversimplify of course these

are a number of sessions and what is shown here is the sort of circles within circles the

deaths within deaths that mark a deepening of progressive deepening into causal level reality so

yeah circles within circles when I looked over the entirety of all of my psychedelic work identified

five fundamental death rebirth processes or levels of consciousness where death and rebirth were

operating these are the five levels first the death of self by which I mean the death of our

time-space identity as our individual identity as our sense of who and what we are moving into

collective mind there are three chapters in the book dealing with the dynamics of collective mind

the ocean of suffering deep time then archetype Lamine experiences that the high archetypal

level experienced it the Lord archetypal level followed by immersion in causal oneness oneness

services of course much earlier in the sequence but there is something quite distinctive about

causal level oneness and finally the diamond luminosity work after everything that had taken

place before emerging into the diamond light that Buddhism calls dharmakaya I call the diamond

luminosity so let me before turning off the power point let me simply take you through

a list of the chapters of LSD in the mind of the universe there is a methodology chapter

chapter one but then in terms of the content of the experiences crossing the boundary of birth and

death the ocean of suffering deep time in the soul initiation into the universe the greater real of

archetypal reality a benediction of blessings the birth of the future human diamond and Manasa

tea and final vision and then there is the last chapter coming off the mountain it took me

actually a year just to write that last chapter that is a chapter in which I reflect on what has

been happening in my life in the 20 years after I stopped my psychedelic work what I'll do is go

through each of these chapters and simply mention a few points on each of the chapters work through

the list as quickly as I can and then we'll open it up for questions and answers let me keep track

of my time okay first crossing the boundary of life and death is the one that's easiest because

it's most familiar it's so thoroughly described in stan grof literature when I entered this domain

which took about two and a half years to navigate and ten sessions my work began Sacher became

saturated with confrontations with death fetal sensations all sorts of severe perinatal seizures

a purging of the body eventually culminating in ego death my ego death basically involved a

complete reversal of everything that I knew myself to be at the time I was an academic a

white male academic philosopher passionately concerned with the meaning of life I became

the complete opposite of that I became women women of color women who were not interested in

philosophical reflection at all I became it was a frightening experience a terrifying experience

but when I let go when I let go and allowed myself to become all these women who were so different

from me I entered the world of women and was given the experience of hundreds and hundreds of women

under the arm with a great mother it was a truly life-changing experience for me and I wish every

man could have that experience when I went into when I went through that death and rebirth process

and went into continued to work I entered into a domain of suffering and pain and agony collective

pain and suffering that was so severe I came to call it the ocean of suffering so let me back up

just for a second working at these levels as I did it every session basically had two phases a

first phase which was a purification phase and a second phase which was the ecstatic phase the

purification phase would be some type of very profound cathartic purification engagement

and if that was allowed to continue to its culmination there was some type of a breakthrough

and then the recession's pivoted to an ecstatic portion for the remainder of the session when I'm

describing the ocean of suffering I'm describing the purification phase of the next two years of

work tremendous suffering at first I thought this was a deepening of ego death I thought somehow

that pieces of my ego were still in play and that this collective suffering represented a deepening

of ego death but eventually this continued for so long and it was so severe that I came to a

different conclusion the conclusion I came to is that somewhere along the line something had

happened in my sessions that these ordeals were not really aimed at my personal transformation

at all that somewhere along the line the focus of my work at this point became actually the

purification and healing of some aspect of the collective psyche some aspect of the collective

unconscious but somehow I was tapping into pain and suffering which was lodged in the collective

psyche and by engaging this pain and suffering consciously it was in some way being lifted out of

the collective psyche and therefore lightening the kind of karmic burden that our species was holding

well I wrote dark night early dawn primarily to understand this whole dynamic primarily to

understand how my sessions how death could become as large as it became in my sessions and by

integrating Rupert Sheldrake's concept of morphic fields into Stan Grof paradigm the way open to

viewing these experiences as part of a larger transformational practice aimed at the collective

psyche in the ecstatic portion of these next these two years of sessions in the ecstatic portion I

entered into what I call deep time in the soul I and I began to have experiences of my life as

a completed whole from start to finish with all the time moments of my life with all the themes

and all the people in circumstances of my life simultaneously present and I was basically taken

into this territory consistently for one year over and over again seven sessions went deeper deeper

and was basically given a profound crash course and Chris beiges life what it was about who the

people were that I was involved in my life was taken into a kind of a spiritual distillation of

what my life was about and what it was going to be about when I first entered this reality and

came out of it after the session it had been the most powerful and transformative experience of

my life and yet I couldn't remember it after the session was over I could not hold on to trance

terrible experiences of this magnitude because there simply was no reference point in my ordinary

consciousness to anchor them but when I went back again and again and again I found that I was able

to hold on to these experiences more effectively I was able to remember them I was able to bring more

and more of them back and this is an important point if you want to enter into these states and

you cultivate systemic recall of the experiences in these states you have to really work with

a lot of discipline you have to engage them very conscientiously record them conscientiously

and if you hold this position well you literally learn how to become how to be stay conscious in

states of consciousness that previously you were not able to hold the conscious awareness in and

this pattern repeated every time I would break through to a new level there was always a period

of disorientation a period of loss of memory but then when I would keep going back over and over

and over again to that new level my cognition improved my perception improved my ability to

understand and record all the experiences improved now the ocean of suffering work I said lasted

two years and 14 sessions but this was actually divided into one year of work and then I took my

six year break and then I started my second Delic work again when I started after my six year break

the ocean of suffering began exactly where it had been in the first year of work so six years

later completely different circumstances in my life completely different expectations and

different astrological conditions nevertheless my sessions began exactly where they had stopped

which is an indication of the the intentionality of the intelligence that's guiding our work when I

started this after the break the ecstatic portion of the sessions began at a completely different

place the ecstatic portion of the sessions began in what I came to call initiation into the

universe I was taken systematically by some intelligence that never adopted any form but I

always felt an intelligence that seemed to be intent on teaching me how the universe functions

how it operates I was given a crash course in cosmology 101 in this material the initiation

of the universe I should mention I give names to my sessions I give every session a name the

name reflects the pith content of the session and I break the session down in bullet points the

names of the sessions that I gave this chapter on initiation the universe these are the sessions

that are discussed in that chapter you and I creating was really a crash course in cosmology

the cosmic tour was an extraordinary tour of the universe then there was a training session

and I called the Council of Elders a session which was training me and how to maintain coherent

consciousness as these deeper levels of awareness were opening dying into one was an extraordinary

immersion into oneness the master plan was the beginning of a series of visions that I'm going to

come back to later it was a series of initiations into what appeared to be the plan that the

creative intelligence had for the evolution of the human species at this point in its history

I know it sounds monstrously arrogant to talk like that but this is simply what happened in the

sessions and then healing the collective wound healing the collective wound was the ocean of

suffering came into a culmination it came into an extraordinary hard to describe I lay it out

of the book as best as I can hard to describe the magnitudes of suffering that one can enter

into in this work and when that work came to its crescendo I was spun from there into archetypal

reality and the ocean of suffering never returned in future sessions there was a lot of work there

was suffering but it was never this collective suffering that seemed to reflect the history of

the human species after the initiation of the universe I entered archetypal reality this lasted

about one and a half years and eleven sessions when I entered archetypal reality I entered a

reality that immediately was recognized as more real than physical reality every time I entered

this level of work I I had the sensation that I was entering a reality that was more real more

existentially real than time and space in fact it became very disorienting to realize how deluded

and watered-down reality is inside time and space reality when I entered this work my human identity

began to fall away from me I found that we have a sense of being human that is deeper than our

sense of being any individual human an ego is a death of our individual experience of being

human but entering archetypal reality required that I somehow let go of human experience at a

deeper level and eventually I could no longer fit myself back into any cognitive frame of

reference related to Homo sapiens I entered a level of consciousness that I experiences being

above and beyond human consciousness and there I was systematically worked with and given lessons

on how reality operated there these experiences kind of broke down and at two different levels at

the high platonic level at the highest level level I encountered beings that were completely beyond

my ability to conceptualize and understand my mind imaged them like galaxies there were just vast

beings that were the creators of time and space they were the creators of life on this planet

they were the guardians of existence they were the massive constitutional forces that actually create

everything that we know as times space in this magnificent universe at a lower archetypal level

at more of a Jungian level I was taken and given many experiences of the collective consciousness

our collective psyche our collective unconscious and even kind of a collective body that all

of our bodies are cells in I was given many experiences on how the collective psyche works

on how reality functions at this level these all took place primarily at subtle level reality so I

was given exercises and the nuts and bolts of how reality works how our individual Minds ourselves

within a larger mind and even how our individual bodies our cells within some kind of fundamental

core archetype of the human body and that when we engage and heal diseases in our individual body

we simultaneously are impacting the health of the human families larger body the list of the

sessions that I address in this chapter xxviii session was an extraordinarily positive session

ecstatic session in which I broke through and touched calls a level reality for the first time

and extremely clear lucid hard to describe state of hyper clarity and then I was quite surprised

to go through three sessions of just gut-wrenching cleansing just on our deal of physical

psychological cleansing that had absolutely no cognitive content associated with it at all

it's just a just a gut-wrenching cleansing in time to make a very long story short I began to realize

that what there is a cycle that I came to call the cycle of purification the cycle of purification

is that every step into a deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher level of

energy so that when we when I first broke into causal level reality in the 28th session I touched

a reality that was so pure that it triggered a purification process in my being that lasted

three sessions extending over six months and I found that this pattern repeated itself over and

over again as I continued to go deeper every time I broke into a new level of conscious and had that

ecstatic experience of waking up in a deeper level of reality the following sessions were very very

difficult very much involved in cleansing carrying out the garbage so much so that I began to dread

the sessions that immediately followed the major breakthrough sessions I should mention here that

one of the things that opened up this level is I began to experience reincarnation as a collective

previously and those of you who know my book on reincarnation life cycles know that the story of

the soul of the story I'm telling of reincarnation there is the story of our individual evolution

directing our individual evolution over many lifetimes reflecting our individual choices and

our individual learning but now I began to have experiences of the entire planet entering into a

reincarnation process and I experienced millions of people over time century after century millions

of people incarnated in a way that was integrated that was you not uniform but that was integrated

so that all of our individual karma our individual soul aspirations our individual challenges were

all part of the collective karma collective challenges and our collective development as a

species it was magnificently beautiful to witness this interplay between individual and collective

reincarnation again all of these taking place at the subtle level of reality when one was gauging

the deeper architecture of the universe after spending about 11 months exploring archetypal

reality and at going through this 11 sessions going through this very quickly I entered what I

came to call the benediction of blessings it was a period of extraordinary blessings just given

one massive blessing after another these are the names of the four sessions that I address in this

chapter the forest was an experience of Shunyata emptiness of self no self in me no self anywhere

around me an experience of radical and profound transparency the birth of the diamond soul I

mentioned in a second singing the universal way was an experience of primal void experience

had culminated in the experience of such at ananda consciousness being in bliss eventually

moving into a complete void the fertile void that subsumes and is the origin out of which the

physical university merged Jesus blood was an experience of extraordinary cosmic love love like

I have never known it before just super saturated soul saturated engaging of love the birth of

diamond soul I want to mention because it'll come up later in the work in that experience in

the birth of the diamond soul session which was really a deeply moving long-lasting session

for me I began to experience all of my former lives coming into me very fast very quickly eleven

years before I had experienced my entire life from beginning to end now I began to experience all my

lives coming in and it was like the we're wrapping kite string around a spool and at some point this

spool ignited It was as if we hit critical mass and all of these lives fused into a singularity

and when they fuse an extraordinary light broke out of my chest it was my first contact with what

I later called Diamond light and I think what I was being given in this session was an experience

of how reincarnation works and where reincarnation is taking humanity this process of accumulating

more and more experience more and more lives is not simply improving us and making us better

beings one life at a time adding a little bit here a little bit there but eventually we're

collecting experience and I think eventually in the entire human saga all of us are coming into a

stage where eventually all of our knowledge all of our experience everything we've ever done everyone

we've ever known through these lives there is a fusion of that knowledge and when that knowledge

fuses we are catapulted into a higher operational status with a different relationship to the

universe a greater transparency to the universe and also a different relationship with everyone

around us because we have been connected to each other for so many lifetimes we have been fathers

mothers enemies friends partners in so many lifetimes when we become whole within ourselves

it opens up a depth of compassion to all beings we experience around us and not just human beings

all beings on our planet after the benediction of blessings where the work went next was into

the diamond luminosity work I was completely existentially satisfied after the the benediction

of blessings work I had given something that I had been asked to give in the ocean of suffering and

I had been repaid and given more in return that I could possibly have imagined but then we went

into the diamond luminosity work but before I begin to tell you about that I want to back step a

little bit and talk about the birth of the future human because it's been a reoccurring theme in

my session starting all the way back to the 22nd session all the way through to the end of the

sessions a reoccurring theme is what is happening to the human race where are we in our evolutionary

journey now I tell this story in the book I've brought together in one place all of the session

material related to the birth of the future human in this one chapter so in the starting with

experiences that first appeared in chapter 6 the initiation of the universe running all the way

through I gathered them all together and collected them into two segments first is a segment that I

call the visions of awakening which are visions that I have been given in different piecemeal

fashion about where we are and where we are going I break this down into six visions these are the

six themes of our wakening what was most striking to me about this was first how dramatic this

process was and how the experience was that we were poised to move into an evolutionary to make

an evolutionary jump that would completely propel us into a higher order of functioning not only as

individuals but as a species we are poised on the edge of a profound Great Awakening but in all of

these visions and I'm going so fast I hate to go so fast through them but in all of these visions

I and which kept pointing to an awakening taking place on the planet of the human species of the

entire species the consciousness of our universe was actually trying to awaken the entire human

species I was not shown how this was going to take place I was not shown how this was even possible

and then about a year and a half after the last of the visions of awakening I was given a session

right in the middle of the diamond luminosity work I had entered the diamond luminosity in sessions

45 and 50 I would enter it again later in sessions 60 and 66 right in the middle I was taken into the

deep time of our species I was given an experience of tape being taken right into the center of the

Great Awakening that we are coming into and there I experienced this transformation not as an

individual human being my boundaries had been opened so many times in the years preceding that

I experienced the Great Awakening as our species I was taken inside the collective psyche and was

given an experience of what will be happening from the perspective of the collective unconscious

my experience there was that for there to be a Great Awakening of this magnitude there must

first take place a great death a great surrender we must be purged and emptied of all our old

ways of thinking and feeling before the space is created to allow awakening of a higher order

of knowing so that the time of great awakening was preceded by a time of great breakdown loss of

control literally an unraveling of life as we know it just as in a psychedelic session one must let

go of everything and experience a profound death before great visions open likewise for our species

we must let go of everything that has dominated our past all the constrictions of our thinking the

constrictions of our mind and the constrictions of our heart in order to open to this new future

which is coming there is a third segment on the birth of the future human and that came later in

the chapter on the final vision I want to say that my visions didn't tell me how this was going to

take place they didn't tell me when it was going to take place and didn't give me any information

about the details it took me inside the collective psyche and gave me an experience of the collective

psyches experience of this and it also gave me an understanding and experience of some of the

mechanisms that are involved at the collective level that will help us move make this huge

transition we are trying to make in the little time that we have to make it I discussed this

I present this I discussed it in darknet early dawn and I lay it out again in LSD in the mind

of the universe the diamond luminosity material as I said before after the benediction of

blessings I had no idea where the work was going to go I was completely existentially

satisfied I had thought I had been drawn deep into the cosmic process I had been overwhelmed

with cosmic love I had been taken into the fertile void underneath all physical existence I had no

idea where things would go but there were still five years ahead on the journey and the diamond

luminosity kevlars four years of the work and 26 sessions it's by far covers more sessions than

any other chapter in the book and a longer period of time what happened was after going through yet

one more very intense death and rebirth process I was taken into a reality a level of consciousness

that was well Buddhism calls it dharmakaya the clear light of absolute love absolute reality

I was taken in a domain of consciousness that was absolute pure light the most striking thing

about the experience was how clear clear clear beyond imagination this domain was just to touch

this for a few minutes was life transforming in and of itself absolutely clear clear beyond the

species mind beyond archetypal reality beyond physical any derivative of physical consciousness

into this hyper clear celestial state over the next four years I entered this reality four

times and only four times out of 26 sessions only four of them took me deep into this reality

here are the names of the sessions death state diamond luminosity the universal field of light

in the nature of mind in between these sessions as you might imagine there were many sessions of

continuing intense purification because this was a deeper level of reality of much more pure level

of reality and that required the purification of my physical and psychological system in order

to stabilize consciousness at this reality they also scattered in these sessions it was a great

deal of personal healing that took place which is kind of curious to me because I would have thought

that personal healing would have taken place much earlier in the journey but it took place here and

I discussed I came to understand why things were unfolding in that order the first two of these

sessions were taking me deeper and deeper into Diamond luminosity which really piqued them in

the 50th session the second two session 60 and 66 the diamond luminosity was crunching itself

deeper and deeper into my physical system into my psychological system into my physical body as

I said talking about these sessions they're very powerful they draw me into them just to try

to describe that the time is short so I want to move through and we'll keep going and we can

come back to mend the question-and-answers let me mention one thing midway through this process

and the 50th session when I went into the deepest transcendent experience I ever had in any of

the sessions into the deepest level of diamond luminosity I was as far into the crystalline

body of God as I had ever been and would ever be and right in the middle of this session I

had an experience that completely changed my understanding of existence in the middle of this

session my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and I saw reality that was far beyond the reality that

I was in inside diamond luminosity and a ray of light came out of that distant reality and hit

me and it completely shattered it just I just absolutely shattered me and in that experience

I realized that there is no end to this journey there is no destiny point at end point that one

eventually reaches that the divine is infinite and will never ever I will never ever be able

to reach even using this powerful method to the absolute ends of that reality now this is

important because I had absorbed and many of us have absorbed the idea that there is an end

point to this journey you become one with God where you enter into the meta cosmic void that

there's an end point and you keep pushing until you reach that end point and I had experienced

oneness with God but I discovered that there are many permutations of oneness there are levels

and levels of oneness and I had experienced the the formless void but I had learned that there

are actually dimensions of formlessness there are depths of born lessness when I when the

diamond luminosity were opened I thought it came with such a profound sense of homecoming it

was so deeply satisfying I thought I had finally found my destination I finally found my stopping

point I had found the end of the journey in this session session fifty showed me that there are

dimensions beyond even that and I would never ever reach some final standpoint the reason the

death kept returning over and over again in this work is if you keep driving yourself and you have

a method that submission would powerful to keep taking you Pastor then limits the universe will

keep taking you deeper and deeper and deeper into yourself into itself and will never be able to

reach the very end of it and that's why I would be gentler with myself if I were doing this

work over again because now I understand that the goal was not to get to some end state or some

ultimate dimension the goal is to open ourselves to the trends ascendant realities and let us

much of that spiritual reality into our hearts and into our minds to let it change us down to the

heart and soul and incorporate as much of it as we possibly can and bring as much of divinity into

time and space as we possibly can and be patient with the rest I'm a little more patient now than

I was when I was a young man doing this work and then this brings me to the final addition

chapter the chapter where yeah I'm gonna take a shortcut here I'll simply say that I was put

through a horrendously powerful stripped-down process and was taken deeper into deep time than

I had ever been taken before and I was given an extraordinarily powerful series of visions about

human evolution and was allowed to experience again the future human that we are in the process

of becoming to experience the architecture the inner architecture of the deep psyche of the

future human and this is a magnificent being just to just to think about this being just to

remember the magnitude of this being brings tears to my eyes it's so important for us to hold on to

the vision of what we are where we are going and what is happening in the deep structure of history

because it's the shadows of our travail deep and as we enter the great time of unraveling as we

enter the purification that we are coming into now it's going to be very tempting and there'll

be all sorts of voices talking about Armageddon and apocalypse and the extinction and the end of

times and this is not the end of anything this is the process of giving birth to a new and finer

version of humanity after this the akancha sness guiding my sessions wrapped it up I didn't know

we were stopping but it wrapped it up and took me through two experiences which I called the goodbye

shion's it basically wrapped up all of our work and at the end of the 73rd session I knew that it

was time for me to stop I want to talk about very briefly coming off the mountain overall I think I

did a good job integrating my sessions as I went I paid a lot of attention to my body I took good

care of my body I did a lot of spiritual practice I wrote my sessions down carefully I tried to

internalize them as deeply as I could session by session I think I did a good job of integrating

my sessions and because I had been given so many gifts and so many blessings in the course of my 20

years of work I thought that I could simply stop my sessions and step back and I would continue

to be nourished by those experiences and I was and that did happen but that's not all that's

happened in the years following the ending of my work in 1999 I found myself gradually entering

into a period of what I call the deep sadness a profound existential sadness what I was suffering

from was a loss of communion with the divine I had entered so deeply into the divine so deeply

into the luminous reality of such supreme super cosmic reality that I knew I would never enter

that deeply into reality into the divinity again before I died I knew I was going away I was

setting it aside and coming back in it for a variety of reasons to much to go into here I had

to stop my sessions it was important for me to stop them but I knew I would never experience

the divine this deeply again until I died and I would experience it again well when I died

but not being able to return this deeply into divinity became an open heartache for me once

you have been have known the joy of dissolving into the divine light once you have dissolved

completely into the boundary list condition transcending time and space life on earth can

tend to feel kind of dried up and basically I was losing interest in continuing to live inside

time and space eventually I realized I was just waiting to die I was taking care of my children

I was taking care of my students and teaching writing but in my heart of hearts I was waiting

to die so that I could return to my beloved to the divine and then years passed and I realized this

is not right this is not the way it's supposed to be everything about my life was screaming

failure to integrate but because I had tried to integrate each of my sessions so carefully

and so conscientiously I did not understand work the failure could lie but I had no choice but to

recognize that somewhere along the line something had gone wrong that it would leave me feeling

so existentially adrift in its wake so I turned and studied my work further to try to figure

out what had gone wrong and what I learned was integrating an entire journey is different than

integrating individual sessions then basically hard to talk about in a matter

of seconds and a half a minute it's hard to describe the process of in a sense

having too much god it almost sounds like a contradiction in terms early more of God is always

better now this entire physical universe is the body of God I knew that I know that I'm standing

here and surrounded and part of the body of the divinity but even that knowledge which had been

given me in my sessions did not save me from the consequences but having entered into full divine

presence so many times in time I began to realize that I had lost a balance in my sessions and the

balance was between transcendence and imminence I had entered so deeply into transcendent reality

that I had lost my foothold in space-time reality transcendence is a magnificent thing it's

very healing to experience transcendence it's very it's very sane making it's very

teaches us what and why we're here but too much transcendence can be disorienting too much

transcendence can actually make you lose contact with another great truth and that is the truth

of our embodied existence I made a completely strong commitment to reestablishing my presence

inside time and space it took me about 10 years I did it through conscious exercises and I did

it through a sheer commitment to live as I was where I was for the my remaining years in this

earth and it took me about about 10 years to really get solidly grounded and operational on

the earth I will say at the same time that I've learned to manage my memories of transcendence

my memories of communion but they're always there in the back of my mind they always guide

me in the in the larger trajectory of my life yes hello thank you very much for sharing this

amazing appearance today you have a I made from Israel I wanted to ask two questions first of all

the about when you say a high dose what is what is the what are the doses that we were talking

about yeah yeah okay go ahead and the second question I wanted to ask about all this all the

setting you know what was the setting cause you know III consumed I do a lot work with with with

plants and I was very interesting to know about the setting how was the setting of the of the of

it of the of the journeys how you did it how you prepared yourself how you did what was in the

moment if you were sitting if you're lying you iced clothes music music nature although these

things and they I would like to know about this and about also about how you were in the daily

life what kind of things helped you to to stay here in a good way like what spiritual practices

or exercise of food or something that was thank you very much yeah good questions thank you I'm

worked at 500 to 600 micrograms which is very high doses of LSD and I mean low dose psychedelic

work maybe one two hundred micrograms this was very high levels my setting I was always working

in complete privacy and inside I was either in my own house or at my wife's professional office well

I was always lying down I was basically if you if you look at Stan's book LSD psychotherapy you'll

get the protocol laid out in great detail music was very carefully curated to pace the stages

of the opening and closing of the session always wearing eye shades not really and the only way of

my sitter would be in communication with me was primarily through the music she took care of my

body and took care of the music and so I was not in nature mm-hmm what was the other part of your

oath the grounding practices um really important you have to maintain grounding is a dynamic

balance my life was very kind of grounded in a schedule in reality first of all was grounded

in relationships was grounded in a long marriage my first wife 24-year marriage it was grounded

in my roles and responsibilities as a father I have three children so wherever I was on Monday

I was on Saturday I was back in the classroom on Monday and I was taking care of my children on

Sunday morning in my teaching a head of a rhythmic a constant set of responsibilities that kept me

always on track always kind of I always grounded in my responsibilities of teaching my students I

was always doing spiritual practice I was always doing a form of meditation I encorte did different

types of meditation over the years but I was always meditating took care of my body doing yoga

various physical practices it's really important to stay in lively contact with one's physical

world while doing this work so basically we're just blowing consciousness out to its farthest

limits and then it spontaneously Rican jails and I found that myself I had a seemingly a natural

capacity an easy capacity Jessica I can no doubt explain in my chart the markers of that yeah a

capacity to let loose and let go of boundaries and then to Rican Geel back into my time-space reality

yeah does that cover your questions enough yes yes thank you very much so I just left question is

to consume this you always made sure let's say there will be someone like in a distance on the

house or somewhere that it would need you need assistance or yeah like you always you make sure

that they nobody would be there yes in my is my mic on yes okay yes I was never left alone I was

always taking care of my wife was my sitter she's a clinical psychologist my first wife Carol she

was my sitter how she never left me alone and she she had complete responsibility for taking care

of our world we were always isolated we were in private there were no interruptions to my work

when I basically closed the door and we entered this world there was absolutely nothing that was

going to intrude from the outside world I think that's really important it's important to have an

absolute clear container I call it entering the Kiva just as in in the southwestern United States

when they would do spiritual practice they crawl into the Kiva a hole in the ground they pull up

the ladder and you're isolated completely from the world while you're doing this work if you're

going to go deep into the universes and very very important to have a completely grounded isolated

protected environment so that you know that whatever you're confronting and I've confronted

some pretty horrendously difficult experiences but whatever you're confronting you know that it's not

coming from outside you it's coming from innocence from inside you or from in it's coming from the

universe but purely through your own consciousness so no outside complications I did not try to

stay in contact with the outside world at all let's hear from Kari go ahead Kari thank you

so much for all your work I've heard you speak years ago through PCC and CIS and I've enjoyed

your writings and and many bits but I love this presentation that you did today so coherent and

walking through each of the stages and sessions and the way you organized the arc of the journey

is really impressive and super-rich so thank you so much for that thank you three questions you can

pick one if you want if it seems too but the the astrological integration I'm really curious about

you know your individual chart your transits how the individual chart kind of functioned as a

lens for you to entering these you know either subconscious parts of yourself to be able to see

them or the you know the collective unconscious as well all of the parts mmm there and and you know

how much of the of the chart do you think remained as you entered these less individuated states yeah

one the individual part two the transits any you know just any little head bits that stick out I

guess and then the third one I'm really curious particularly it came up for me when you were

talking about being in the ocean of suffering and the the healing that can come about from

processing that internally and individually and I'm curious if you if those effects you felt them

in your I'm just gonna call it your waking life your your normal states of consciousness in if

it kind of came back from people around you or in world events or you know any potent moments where

that where that you really felt that reflection of your internal experience from the external world

yeah let's start on your last question and then work forward into the earlier ones yeah it did

manifest there were manifestations that emerged in the outer world and so let me mention my book

the living classroom and there's a chapter on teaching and dark matter lead on what my I never

talked to my students about my work right I just made a firewall between my professional life and

my inner harmonic work and yet I found over time that various students were being activated by my

inner work though that the deeper I went the more powerful the activation became and it became such

a prominent part of my teaching that I found that I had to I had to understand what was going on

I had to learn how to work with these forces so for me integration doesn't mean simply personal

integration into my personal life but it also means helping take care of all the derivative

social fallout of one's own experiences I found for example that while I was teaching and I would

just be reaching to give examples of something I was trying to explain that the examples that I

would reach for would without my even being aware of it students were coming up after class and they

say you know that's interesting that you use that example because that's exactly what happened to

me this week and this happened over and over again that there was some kind of boundary which had

come down between my mind and my students mind it was and not only not only were these things

kind of like triggering sort of an aha moment from my students isn't that curious you know but

the deeper I went the more these synchronistic touches began to trigger very very deep healing

experiences in the students It was as if their souls were in communication with my soul and they

were giving me bits and pieces of insights into where they were what they needed where they were

suffering where they were hurting and this was happening without me being consciously aware of

the process at all and so I really had to study this I really had to understand what was what was

driving these processes and eventually I wrote after dark night early dawn I wrote an entire book

on the living classroom on the collective dynamics in the classroom and I don't mention psychedelics

there because this is not a psychedelic phenomena this is simply about the nature of consciousness

at one level we have private mind but just beneath our private mind mine does not have privacy

there are collective dimensions of mind it's like throwing a rock into a lake the ripples

spread out when you do deep deep work the ripples of that work spread out and touch the lives of

people around you the place where I experienced this most profoundly was in my classroom because

I was working in a collective context I could see these ripples coming back at me all the time the

first the issue of astrology and individual and global transits this is a complicated question

and I'm not an astrologer so I want to be very careful about this I tracked my sessions I used

astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from Rick tarnis about the correlations between outer

planets and inner experience in psychedelic days so I I plant my sessions by transits and I also

tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs projected against the pattern of the planets and I found it

to be a very complicated correlation while there were correlations between my individual transits

and global transits with the unfolding of my psychedelic experience there were also differences

that I wasn't expecting there was a kind of a failure to find correspondence for example my

breakthroughs were not always paired with with Uranus all right my my really really intense up

against the wall death in your face experiences were not a confident we're not marked by Saturn

transits or Saturn global transits or even Pluto transits and so it was a complicated process when

when my work began to go off the edge of time and space when I began to enter deeper and deeper into

archetypal reality and then beyond archetype of reality into dharmakaya or the diamond luminosity

I found what I felt was a kind of a roll-off of astrological variables that the astrology did not

seem my my psychedelic dance did not seem to map very easily into the astrological dance and I

began to think that there actually might be a roll off effect of one's solar dance and one's

session experiences and this continues to be an area of active dialogue for me it's an active

consideration there is an appendix in the book the last appendix is called pushing the limits of

astrological correspondence and in that chapter in that appendix I give the dates of all of my

sessions so if one wanted to one can look at my natal chart one could look at the sessions

when you look at the correlations or lack of correlations and so forth now I know that that's

not a this not enough sessions given in the book to really get a definitive answer but I wanted

to support the discussion of the relationship between astrology astrological transits and global

transits and one's own psychedelic work to me that's an open question at this point I know that

there are correlations particularly in the early stages of one works whether those correlations

continue to be as strong in the late stages of one's work I'm not as convinced I'm okay in terms

of my own chart that gets too complicated you know I have a lot of Neptune in my chart I have a lot

of water in my chart I have a Sun square Neptune with Neptune in the first house so there are a

lot of them I have some other dynamics that I was destined to do this type of work you know and

I want to mention the ocean of suffering this was not something that was forced on me I didn't

understand at the time but this and I don't think the universe forces any of us into this type

of work this was too too hard too demanding too difficult for it to have it before so I mean what

I learned over time again is it this is something that I voluntarily took on in this incarnation

it was part of the plan of my incarnation to do this work and to do the ocean of suffering work

in particular so I'm the volunteer and I think we're all when we get into this deep deep muck

that we get into we're volunteers for this work awesome thank you so much Pauline amber in Poland

and we are so happy to finally see you live and thank you wanted to say how much we appreciated

your call I have a few questions but let's start and let's continue the theme of the ocean of

suffering and where we live in Poland of course was the site of one of the most horrific events

that happened I would say for centuries which by which I mean of course the Holocaust yeah

when you had your experience of the ocean of suffering did you experience anything specific

or was the specific information or visions that you had that might have related to something

like this the reason I'm asking this question is because the event which happened 80 years ago

is so palpable that it's still in the atmosphere it's still in the collective you can feel it

here in the land and you know it's it's there in the collective for him whether we like it

or not and I was just interested in whether in any admissions you actually had a sense

of what happens then yeah I did not go into specifically identifiable historical traumas like

the Holocaust what happened was I basically was taken into deeper and deeper and deeper into pain

and fury and chaos and extraordinary suffering that kept getting larger and larger it wasn't

narrowly focused in any century or any country or any place it expanded to include hundreds of

thousands millions of people and it expanded to include hundreds of years thousands of years

until eventually my subjective experience was that it included all the human beings and all the

conflicts that emerged in the history of humanity I mean something of that scope so I have no doubt

that trauma like the Holocaust or trauma like the extinction of Native Americans and other tribal

conflicts and so on I have no doubt that those were implicitly present in what I was working

with but it it wasn't explicitly present it was like to me you know stan has this concept of

a coexistence system of condensed experience I think the collective psyche also has these

massive aggregate these balls of collective experience I call them the the meta matrices

they are they are the the meta coexistence the correct systems of the collective psyche that fuse

multiple historical periods and multiple cultures and multiple people's experience late in this

whole series it became very clear to me was that what I was engaging was memory a living memory of

trauma that was embedded in the collective psyche I should mention that where I live in Youngstown

Youngstown Ohio we haven't had a Holocaust here but we have a long history of violence it goes

back to the Native Americans and there were some massacres that took place here there is a

tremendous influx of Eastern European this is a town that made steel there's there's a lot of

old-world patriarchy a lot of violence against women a lot of old institutional violence and the

Mafia took over our town for decades they were gangland shootings in neighborhood parking lots

my sense is that because the ocean of suffering was on the agenda in my work that I was actually

brought to a place where these poisons run close to the surface in the collective psyche and

I'm sure that if I were working in Poland or in a place that it would have been more explicit

the historical trauma that you're referring to thank you thank you first of all Chris thanks so

much for all your work over the the decades been a huge fan forever and ever and ever and I'm just

so wonderful and on this ocean of suffering issue that's been brought up and touched on because

that's kind of like the next stop on the journey for a lot of the people out there working your

book dark night early dawn was extremely helpful to patron i we we don't work with LSD we work

with holotropic breathwork which is just another technique in order to connect with these things

and what we had noticed over the years was that there were individuals who under not predictable

circumstances began to contact what seemed to be this ocean of suffering it wasn't a past life

which happens often enough but there was thinking about it and then we realized my goodness people

need some clarity that this is not just a personal stuff that they're saddled with and have to carry

around forever they are in a sense volunteers yes and so this was extremely useful and some people

in spiritual emergency that come to us begins realized oh so I was trying to solve the basic

problem between men and women for the last five thousand years okay well you know I've got other

things I've got to do today and so that I want to thank you very much for that and it's clear now

how this network will make more available to many more people whatever techniques to work at even

with spontaneous experiences and what we developed was using systemic constellation work then to do a

constellation for the individual that is caught in this that would say okay here's the representative

for the part of the man woman's story that's mine and here's a representative for the part of the

man woman's story that hmm you know that's a great big thing and then to let this this clarity Wow

I do have work to do we all have work to do and there's something else going on yeah and and so

I just want to thank you for the earlier work I'm so glad to see this thank all the powers that

living breathing so I'm looking forward to the stage and our workshops in which the the comments

about the other other stages of the past becomes thank you I I completely agree and I think as

we go deeper into this historical crisis that we've entered I think we're entering into a

collective dark night of the soul it seems like there's a profound detoxification taking

place that the poisons of history are coming out of our collective pores maybe we see it if we

look around us in body politic but it's coming out of our pores and it's coming up underneath

us and flooding so that if we're interested in doing purifying work if we're interested in

doing transformational work when we open we open it if we have a technique that's powerful

enough like holotropic breathwork we open at an individual level and then we open at these

deeper levels now I'm not a therapist but if I were a therapist and if I were working with

people entering these states I think just what you're describing differentiating different

levels of the work that emerges recognizing kind of what is mine personally and what is

not mine personally but mine collectively it's important to have closure and to be able to

close these collective levels and there would be I would think an importance of kind of widening

those sessions down and kind of concretizing the collective work in contrast and separate from

one's individual work now I will say that I went into this work voluntarily I stayed into

it voluntarily and I am infinitely glad for just personal reasons let alone the collective

reasons I am personally very glad to have done this work because the rewards that came were

not simply a karmic paying back but when one opens and embraces one's life as a member of the

species when one's open to the species and takes responsibility for the pain and suffering of the

species it sets in motion not only a healing of that species but there is a tremendous infusion

of light that enters into the collective psyche and into your psyche as it enters into the

collective psyche and so I have been so deeply rewarded more than amply compensated for the

work that I did in the ocean of suffering and other levels and I think that this is true for

other people too that when we give deeply and generously to those around us sooner or later

we don't know when how or where but sooner or later there is a deep fruition that comes up

underneath us that carries us individually where the universe is intent on carrying the

human species as a collective and that is into this birth of this profoundly new quality of

consciousness that I'm calling the diamond soul or the future human thank you so much Chris

as Kerry said that was such a beautifully laid out coherent arc and I'm so April for the time

that you have spent with us today and for all of you here connecting from all around the world

thank you so much for uniting today in both our hearts and our minds and we send each of you so

much love and infinite blessings on your journey as you deepen into your own explorations

and the healings that we're all here doing right now today in this world thank you so

much be well and we will see you next time

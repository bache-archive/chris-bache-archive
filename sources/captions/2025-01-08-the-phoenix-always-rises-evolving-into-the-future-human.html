are you this slightly gray December day over here but it might be lovely where you are hi Amanda it's pleasure to be here with you I'm speaking to you from Weaverville North Carolina which is just outside of Asheville North Carolina and it's a sunny day here it's going to be in a lovely afternoon in the mid 40s wow okay now now I have Weather Envy but but hey you're in a swing state which at some point we might get on to that must have been quite entertaining for a brief period of time let's not go there it's too painful all right so you've written a number of books you had a very inspiring life and my projection onto you which I am almost certain is not true is that you have the answers to life the universe and everything so we'll lay that one to bed as it's my projection and you don't see it that way just so clear we're there and from where you are what is most alive for you at this inflection point of humanity well we've just gone through an election in our country which was for the liberal side of the continent like me was very disappointing and very upsetting what's happening in politics in my country and in many countries around the world this whole movement to the conservative right is very much of concern especially since they are denying fundamental facts that are CR critically important for Humanity to address first and foremost is uh the fact of global climate change um and um yeah so that's happening and in my book LSD in the mind of the Universe I have a whole chapter on what I call the birth of the future human which summarizes all the Transmissions that were given to me over a 20year course of high dose lstd sessions about Humanity's future where we are in our evolutionary development um the critical crisis that we are moving into uh the birth of of a new form of humanity coming out of that crisis so when I and a a great future for Humanity but for a deep spiritualize realization to emerge in humanity there must take place first a Dark Night of the Soul a collective Dark Night of the Soul so I see what's happening politically uh against that backdround of a growing dismantling of assumptions a growing unraveling of our social contracts and uh a growing Global crisis which seems to be generated by uh seems to be generating by a series of EOC crises okay so that gives us an opening into the birth of the future human um for those watching on YouTube my cat is on the desk it's easier to let him just ramble across and then he'll go away it I'll be fine um before we go there so it seems to me let's just address the politics because it's aive for everyone this is going out at the start of the New Year 2025 is going to be the year when everything changes yeah America sneezes the world gets a cold and and nothing will be the same particularly not geopolitics is about to shift enormously I think a a US Russian Alliance has never happened before and it looks like it's arising in real time and it seems to me 71 million people voted vot for Trump that means by my Reckoning 259 million didn't and yet there's been effectively a bloodless coup by the fascist right and yet no amount of ideology however forcefully they try to impose it can actually overcome biophysical reality you cannot stop climate change by pretending it's not happening yeah the the the ostrich position is only useful until the flood waters fill the hole that you've stuck your head in yeah so it seems almost to me that also to me that the shifts that we need need to be inner and collectively inner which is exactly the field that you're working in yeah and we don't want to go back over everything that you experienced but I wonder if you've got a kind of an elevator pitch of where you started and where it took you to in terms of your own spiritual process is that something that we could go into sure I can give you a kind of a quick overview I began my psychedelic work when I was just hired as a university professor in Northeast Ohio uh and I began this work as a pretty well educ ated dedicated agnostic with strong atheistic inclinations that's where all the years of graduate school had brought me but just when I started teaching I came across the work of stanislav gr and his book Realms of the human unconscious changed the direction of my life I saw the importance of his work for my discipline which was philosophy of religion I'm not a psychologist I'm not a therapist I'm a professor of philosophy of religion and so I began an underground uh regimen of psychedelic therapy because I knew that in order to speak intelligently uh using this new methodology you had to do the work yourself and even though it was illegal by this time this was 1978 when I started my career I started my psychedelic work in 1979 psychedelics were illegal I made a decision to do this work uh in underground fashion completely isolated um I never let my students and most of my faculty never knew what I was doing in this regard I continue this work for 20 years uh I started it when I was 30 and I finished it when I was 50 and I did 79 high does LSD sessions which is a very aggressive protocol I don't recommend this protocol you did this so we don't have to as far as I can see and I'm enormously grateful yeah and then I spent another 20 years digesting those experiences writing about them integrating them trying to integrate them and written two books based on those experiences one of them is Dark Knight early Dawn which came out in 2000 and probably the more important one for a wide audience is LSD in the mind of the universe which came out in 2019 so I did this work for 20 years and then LSD in the mind of the universe came out 20 years later after I stopped after you'd integrated a lot of what happened and after you were also it seems from the book just beginning to be able to start talking about it CU you you had issues where you couldn't speak you physically couldn't speak because you couldn't speak of what you understood and what you knew can you tell us a little bit about that that seemed to me quite an integral part of what was happening well I love teaching and I love working with the students students I I just really love being in the classroom and I knew that if I began to speak openly uh about psychedelics in the SE 70s 80s 90s even I very likely would lose my Prof my position at the University uh and so I could not speak openly about my work I mean I really I spoke indirectly by giving teaching courses on psychedelic therapy and Stan gr's work and other people's research but I I didn't wasn't able to own my experience es publicly at my University till the very very tail end of my career I retired in 2011 in order a little bit early in order to give me time to bring forward what I consider my most important work and my conviction is that psychedelics represents a revolution not just in in therapy not just a clinical Revolution but a revolution in How We Do philosophy and this methodology is that we move systematically into fa very carefully controlled non-ordinary States we experience them as consciously as we can we bring them back preserve them write a detailed written account within 24 hours and then spend some time digesting them integrating them with our other bodies of knowledge then going back into that state and coming in so this method of systematically entering into non-ordinary States and coming back represents a new me methodological platform for the doing of philosophy so what we're looking at is what the emergence of what I would call a psychedelic philosophy a psychedelic that's grounded on the systematic application of non-ordinary states of Consciousness through the use of psychedelics um yeah can I interrupt here because this is already opening doors and um and I'd like to go down a few of them so we're talking about integrating with other systems and in the book you were becoming quite deeply involved in some Buddhist practices I were they Buddhist I think um and and so it strikes me within the shamanic world we get a lot of people who want to go off and do iasa or do mushrooms and it seems to me there it's shortcutting and not universally I have spoken to people who are absolutely prepared to go and spend six months in the forest alone with the plants and integrate it but there are an equal number of people who seem to think they can go from point A to point Zed without actually doing any of the steps in between and what I'm think I'm hearing from you is that the steps in between are absolutely crucial and that they need to be undertaken in a structured fashion in in spite of the fact that it we feel to me to be moving away from the reductive scientific space where atoms move around like billiard balls and everything is predictable as long as we have enough data points yeah to a point of where everything is emergent and complex and actually nothing is predictable but experience the the phenomenology of living yeah is what matters and the more than human world comes in and takes part it it seemed to me reading certainly the second book to an extent the first but particularly in the second that there was an extraordinary coherence you had a six-year Gap in the middle and yet when you when you went back you basically took off it was like a serial dream which those of us who practice dreaming you sometimes night after night after night you're in the same story and you were getting this you were in a an almost linear progression except it was more fractal than linear I would say you you're building on previous knowledge and you were being taught yeah quite clearly and so can you unpick for us a bit of the structure that you see that is useful in order for this to be something that helps us move towards being future humans okay well there several things rolled into your observations they're all good they're all good observations um so some process uh comments um first I think integration is very important we're finding we have the technology the the the chemical technology to trigger very deep States Of Consciousness but these states of Consciousness may have very little lasting impact on how are deeply engrained psychological cultural habits if we don't take time to sit with these experiences and integrate them as deeply as we can into our embodied existence uh and over the course of my work I learned that even though I was paying a lot of attention and doing as as good a job as I could to integrate each individual session and doing an adequate job I think I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey but I did not fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey at the end and then realized how hard the stopping hit me which then exposed the uh the imbalance the failure to integrate uh the radical the most extreme most radical experiences which were the deepest experiences being drawn into intimacy into communion with I'm I want to say the Divine but I I'm cautious about that because we have to unpack all sorts of theological you know uh not on this podcast actually you could we talk about the heart mind of the universe all the time which I think is is for me what you would call the Divine so I think we can assume that unpacking has been done in the past five years heart mind of the universe is good I like that's why the book is called LSD in the mind of the universe it could be the heart mind of the universe yeah U but you came to a point where you were basic basically marking time waiting to die in order to return to Unity with the Divine yes did I understand that correctly no you un you got it correctly it's kind of jumping ahead to the story let me back up and work to that point okay good if you work and and I think in order to extract the maximal psychological psychospiritual and philosophical value these experiences it's very important to create a container what I call the the the Kaa of practice a container which affords you uh the best opportunity for absolutely clear contact with these deeper States Of Consciousness without interruption without confusion no outside contact you're in a therapeutic environment you're lying down you're with a skilled sitter uh you're listening to carefully curated music uh it's a it's a it's a complex process which you have to prepare for you have the session you you're integrating the session acutely for several days after so each session takes a week essentially to you know just for the immediate session uh and then as you build on these sessions over time I you're right it's a linear I found a linear progression relatively speaking U you know Consciousness is a holistic phenomenon so you may experience multiple levels of consciousness simultaneously you may experience some deep levels of consciousness early in your journey work but if you work systematically my experience at least is that there was a progressive deepening so that I went through rounds of of deepening when I was writing up my journey at the very end I looked at my the Total Landscape of my experiences and I broke it down into five fundamental Landscapes that I had been exploring one is personal mind your personal unconscious second is the collective mind the species mind Carl Yung would have called the collective psyche third archetypal mind fourth causal mind the mind of Oneness and fifth the diamond Luminosity so my experience was I would work I would go through successive succession of death and rebirth experiences eventually I would have a breakthrough that would catapult me into a new level of Consciousness where I would have to learn how it worked it was a totally different it was like a different physics governing this level of reality and I would work there I would continue to learn there but in that process I would go through more purification exercises more episodes of death and rebirth that weren't simply repeating ego death but were taking me into a deep deeper cycle of death and rebirth and eventually that would culminate and it would I would have a breakthrough into a completely different level of reality and that level of reality I would all start over again I wouldn't understand how it would work it would be confusing then I would keep going back to it I'd get my seal legs I would acclimate to it my my Visionary experience would get clearer and then I would go and get propelled into another level of reality and when I was in the middle of the deepest deepest level I went into the diamond Luminosity I had an experience in which I was I had an experience of a level of light Beyond The Diamond luminosity and a ray of light came out of that reality hit me shattered me and what it taught me was it's an infinite progression I had thought in the beginning it was a matter of becoming one with God or getting to the metac cosmic void stage of work but what I found is that there are many many levels of God there many levels even of the Primal void that's an infinite progression you'll never reach the end to of it even using as powerful a protocol as high dose LSD work and that really is one of the things that shifted my entire orientation because if I were doing it over again I would be much gentler with myself I would use lower doses I would balance and Vary the Psychedelic that I was using because I've learned that the goal of the work is not to get to some end stage or end point which would you know change your life forever but the goal is simply to open let as much of the wisdom of the universe in as possible as much of the love as much of the insight and then spend weeks months years integrating that those experiences changing whatever it is about your life that is keeping you from experiencing those realities on an everyday daily basis and then continuing work so at the end of my journey I had I found that I had gone so deep into intimacy with the Divine into the Divine Light dissolving completely into feels of light transcending space and time so deeply that when I stopped this work and and I'll go later if you want to why I stopped the work but I stopped it after 20 years and then in the Years following I found that I was missing the Transcendent Clarity so deeply uh that I found I was just waiting to die so that I could return When I died and after reflecting on this for a long period of time I began to realize something's not right this is not the way this work work is supposed to end it's not healthy and I spent a lot of time then studying my work to try to find out where I had gone wrong and I realized I came to realize that I had I had gone so deeply into Transcendence that I had created an imbalance within my Incarnation an imbalance which was tilted towards Transcendence at the expense of embodied affirming my deeply physical bed existence and both of the these are two fundamental truths we are always tapped into Transcendence we're always tapped into the physical world but I had tilted the balance very far and I had to make a conscious choice to reground myself in physical reality uh so that I could become U more comfortable in my own skin and this began and writing LSD in the mind of the universe was a tremendous help because I was speaking about my experiences and I'm an academic and I you know I love to talk so I I love to teach and by speaking about these experiences it it empowered my integrating the experiences and by sharing them publicly after so many years of keeping them private it allowed a healing to take place inside my own psyche between that which had had been hidden and that which had been public between the higher and that which is quote lower or the earthier um yeah yeah again many doors opened we want to come back to why you ended I would like to make clear to people listening first of all this was industrial doses of LSD and you've explained that you went through death and rebirth experiences I think it's worth pointing out that there were points where you were vomiting so hard for so long that the vessels in your eyeballs r it yeah it wasn't sounding like a whole lot of fun to me and you also had your then wife who was a trained psychologist psychotherapist I can't remember but she was very good at holding the space so you had a lot of anchoring and it still sounds like the early part of every single Journey was living hell as far as I can tell would that be fair yeah it's it's what I discovered eventually that there is a purification cycle early traditionally we would call it the death rebirth cycle but we often think of death as something that happens to us one time and a lot of the therapeutic literature in psychedelic work circles focuses on ego death which is for me is only the first round and what I learned later after you've died many times in this process I mean completely loss of control metaphysical confusion just complete surrender to overwhelming metaphysical uh waterfalls uh you learn that first you cannot die it's impossible to Die the form that you are can die the structure of life as you have known it can be extinguished but the Inner Essence of your being always reemerges the Phoenix always Rises and I in that process I also learned that death what we experience as death is actually an extremely int form of purification when your purification reaches so deeply that it reaches into the fundamental assumptions that structure your experience of reality then death has returned to Grace you right so it's purification breakthrough experiencing a deeper State and if you want to stop at that level that's perfectly fine different people use different psychedelics different modalities that different powers to and some psychedelics only have sufficient power to reach certain levels happened that the the method that I was using the substance I was using was so powerful it had the power to keep breaking me through level after level in this systematic fashion um yeah yeah and and did you choose LSD because of Stang gr and and it was the thing back in the 70s that I suppose that's a head mind question but my spirit mind question is you could have done a lot of different things ioska wasn't around much but mushrooms were there were other things that were there do you think that whatever it is that guides you through this Incarnation LED you to that because you said you wouldn't do it again now but you wouldn't be who you are now if you hadn't yeah gone through the the par yeah the military the military version of of completely destroying yourself many times can you speak to that well to understand why I chose LSD you have to go back to 1979 1980 iasa was still not yet on the playing field for most part just early mushrooms certainly were I understood LSD to be more powerful than mushrooms so the the the primary reason though is that my work was based upon Stan gr's work and I trusted Stan I trusted his research and Stan did most of his work with LSD so that's where I dug in I I dug in there later after I finished my 20e journey I've done many psychedelics I've done mushrooms and 5 Meo and Salvia deorum and San Pedro uh different psychedelics in iwasa which are are beautiful and they've taught me a lot uh and I have a certain sense of that each of these psychedelics impact the spectrum of Consciousness or open some portion of the spectrum of Consciousness the the the kind of contact I experience with psilocybin for example is very body grounded very emotional body grounded LSD tends to be a have a high cosmological sealing tendency certainly at high doses it tends to push the high ceiling whereas psilocybin is much more grounded earthy in my Earthly existence yeah and and it's seems to me it's more to do with opening doors into the rest of the web of life rather than necessarily Cosmic awareness not that the two are mutually exclusive but there's as you were saying there's a tilt one way or the other a tilt yeah I want to move towards the future human but just before we go there I'm wondering how was it taken in academic circles when you wrote these books were there people who then came to you and went yes I've been wanting to do this or I have been doing this and thank you for opening the doors or were there others For Whom the door was now shut and you your access was denied how did it land with your people uh my work has been well received in the Consciousness community and in the academic Community they don't even know I exist for the most part it's been ignored there hasn't been a single professional review published of my work out of a hardcore academic philosophy journal or religious studies Journal um but you must have friends who could publish in those journals you must have ways into that if if people wanted to is it just not worth their career to do that you know I just one of the things I decided early on in my career was not to try to address the reservations which were abundantly clear to me coming out of the traditional academic mindset I decided that if I tried to justify the method and justify the experiences to my colleagues it would it would hamper me it would hold me back I just decided to push deeply ahead and let the chips fall where they may and and I understand uh how exotic how strange my claims are how they sound to people ra you know raised educated in a traditional environment and I've just decided to let that go and let history sort things out I I am acutely aware that I'm writing not for my present generation I'm writing for my for future Generations who will you know yeah Paradigm chains take place in evolutionary context and so I'm just doing the work and letting other people sort out what they think it's worth down the road and with any luck I I would have given my ey teth to be one of your students and it sounds like there are particularly we we touched on the earlier moments when you were having what we would now consider to be psychic experiences where you knew things that from non-ordinary reality not when you were on the LSD but just when you were teaching and then and then you had to hold them in because if you said something it was basically going to blow everybody's fuses and they were going to wonder how you knew it and didn't explain how you knew it but those students I am thinking have been in the in the field of your awareness at a point when you are experiencing i' I've begun to see the world in a different space so with any lot they'll go off and change the world so I'll take one aspect about that particular I never let my students know that I was doing this work but I began to find that even though they did know about my psychedelic work they began to have experiences which were moving showing that they were being impacted by my psychedelic work and secondly my work was changing me at a deep structural level so that my person became a lightning rod that was sparking transformational insights or breakthroughs among my students without me consciously intending it I began when I would be lecturing I was drawing into my lecture examples which were purely random for me but the examples I was being told were actually the exactly the same thing that had been happening to my students that week and the things I was saying began to touch them in very very deep personal intimate places places they were wounded uh places they were blocked from going forward this became such a common feature of my work that eventually I spent a lot of time studying this and developing an entirely new way of of teaching to take into account the truths that I was discovering in the classroom and in my psychedelic work that evolved around the boundaryless nature of Consciousness feels of Consciousness that feels develop in groups there's an energetic resonance which happens underneath the verbal exchange of ideas as a Consciousness directly engaging Consciousness and so I published a book in 2008 after I stopped my sessions called The Living classroom in which I lay it all out uh but I never mention psychedelic because the issue is not psychedelics the issue is consciousness the potential of conscious so if you do very deep Consciousness work without psychedelics I think you can trigger the same things that I experienced but eventually just recently this actually this month uh Sunni press is bringing out a second edition of the living classroom and in this Edition they invited me to tell the truth about my psychedelic practice because I'm out of the closet by now LSD in the mind of the universe was out so the new addition of the living classroom makes clear that it was my psychedelic practice that was driving the phenomena that were emerging in my classes even though I think other people not using psychedelics can experience the same thing so that's that's a whole another uh another aspect that has to do with integration because integration here means taking care not only of yourself but taking care of anyone whom your practice touches which for me included many of my students and one-third of the book is just essays that my students have written very deep essays personal essays about their own spiritual experiences their experience of death it's a that's a beautiful section of the book right I will find that and put a link in the show notes and you were still teaching the philosophy of religion at this point you hadn't branched out into other things is that right yeah I I was teaching classically religious studies courses introduction to world religions Eastern religions Buddhism psychology of religion mysticism and meditation you know classic curriculum gosh I wish there were the classic curriculum when I went through but my my senior apprentice and I don't work with psychedelics but we work we teach shamanic studies and I found even when I'm talking about the book in front of uh a literary Festival that's that you basically full of ordinary middle class people who come along and had nothing better to do and wanted to get out of the rain as far as I can tell and you end up drawing in examples that seem to come out of nowhere and then someone goes oh you just me mentioned Boston and something about streets in Boston about which I know precisely nothing I come from Boston and the streets are just like that so so I'm sure that what you said is absolutely true and and at a deeper level when we're teaching a held Circle then then the resonance is move across the circle but becoming aware of these such that everyone in the circle is engaging with that strikes me as a step towards future humanism where I think we're becoming conscious of the things that can help us to be different humans once you understand how Fields work and once you develop a protocol that maximizes potential of the emergence of cons of these Consciousness changing Fields within groups then you you do it in a way that accelerates deepens not only the learning experience but it accelerates the transformational value of these exercises for everyone involved and this applies not just to university courses it applies in Research Laboratories in boardrooms wherever citizens Gather in sustained conversations uh which is where most of our change takes place in dialogue with other human beings and so this is very relevant to uh the challenges moving into yeah yes so let's go there so let's lay out where I think roughly we're at and you can tell me because you live in the US and I'm just watching it with kind of squinched up eyes from across the water waiting for it to come over here you know musk has already said he's going to basically buy the next election and we have always had the best democracy money could buy so yeah unless we can change the Democratic process that's it so mus and starlink I I've been floating across substack watching some very interesting very geeky people pointing out how he managed to steal the election and how the numbers don't add up but you know if you're going to feed everything through starlink the person who owns the starlink can make it say what they want it to say you and I are talking across many thousands of miles using technology that in the end is basically owned by an individual who might be very interesting but I don't necessarily want them knowing everything that I think can do so it seems to me that Evolution only happens under moments of intense pressure I would like this moment not to become any more intensely pressurized probably will but yeah this is as much as I ever want therefore can we evolve our Consciousness to become future humans and it seems to me that you have a doorway and a framework and a concept within which that could happen does that how does that bend with you um that all aligns fine and and I think you're absolutely correct I'm not sure that I have a doorway that I would recommend as such but I do think that psychedelics have entered our historical scene at precisely a time when we need more awareness we need it for therapeutic Pro P processes we need it for political processes we need to wake up and grow um and so I think it's historically important and there are thousands and thousands of people working conscientiously not superficially but very conscientiously working with psychedelics in order to heal the accumulated trauma of many lifetimes um and to open up a deeper communion with the intelligence that's resides within the universe to help us make a transition from a mechanical dead Universe of of dead matter to a living universe that's alive at its core that's expressing its its intentionality through the uh Quantum jumps that take place in our evolutionary journey and I think we are coming into a Quantum jump right now in a nutshell uh well let me back up a sec this chapter the birth of the future human and everything that it contains is completely came into my work by complete surprise I thought of myself doing the work I was doing for personal transformation personal healing maybe even personal Enlightenment but what happened is that the method was so powerful it pushed beyond all those categories and I had to reframe my understanding of the boundaries of conscientious psychedelic work in a way that dropped the model of personal transformation and opened up into a model of collective transformation I had years and years of experiences where the shadow that I was engaging was not my personal Shadow I did that work but this was a collective Shadow the pain and the excruciating suffering that I was processing had to do with the pain of my entire species uh and there that I came to understand that there is a collective psyche that that holds the trauma of Humanity's history just as our individual TR psyche holds the trauma of our individual history and this Collective trauma and Collective pain encumbers the free functioning of the collective psyche just as our individual trauma encumbers our individual health and well-being so by doing this work uh I began to understand that something in the universe was using my sessions to make a small contribution to Healing the collective psyche in order to make it more available to the influx of energy from Divine Consciousness uh to allow it to manifest more completely uh in humanity now right that that bit can you just say that again because I think that's really important it's not that it's that opening of the door to something that's trying to come in is that what I just heard you say can you just repeat that because I think that needs emphasizing I think we are living at a time of ascending spiritual energy there's it's almost like there's an influx of higher light energy spiritual energy pushing in on us and our the pain of our history the the the karma of our narrowness of our smallness of our trying to live within a framework of individual ego at cost of anyone else's well-being uh keeps us um locked away uh uncens insensitive to this incoming light and as in any mystical development before there is a a breakthrough into nonu or unitive Consciousness there is a Dark Night of the Soul where you have to undo you have to let go of all of the obstacles all the the blocks and I think this is happening at a collective level not only inside intense psychedelic sessions but everywhere if you're doing past life therapy many of the lives that come up to be cleansed or uh not necessarily your personal former lives but they can be lives within the system social movements to end child abuse to end abuse of our daughters to end racism to end speciesism these things are tackling these movements are tackling pains which are much deeper than simply our personal pain and we are the whole system is kind of straining against the burdens of the past in order to open itself to take in more powerfully uh the energy of our future the light of our future so so in that context in the middle of this work I began to receive visions that were stable they were consistent and they stretched over several years they were dropped into my sessions about where humanity is in its evolutionary Journey where it's going and there was a message of we were coming into a time of radical pivotal breakthrough a before and after time that the past would become quickly irrelevant because something fundamentally new was emerging but it never showed me for years how nature was going to accomplish this I had no idea and then in 1995 years later I had a fundamental experience where and I was working at very deep Levels by this time I was into the diamond Luminosity material but this session took me and it broke me open it dissolved my mind into the species mind and then asked the consciousness of the species and I I understand how radical an assertion that is and I don't take it lightly but the species mind opened into it took me into future time it took me into what I call Deep time and in that future I experienced the death and Rebirth of humanity I experienced Humanity coming to an absolute breaking point a point of breakdown an unraveling of of fundamental trust fundamental convictions within our culture a deep systematically systematic breaking down until the entire planet it seemed was faced with the task of mere survival just trying to survive and it looked like it was an Extinction event at first it looked like that was it we we were we had overloaded the system so badly we had overdrawn the the ecological balance sheet of the planet so badly that we weren't going to come out of it but then what happened in the Visionary experience is just when things were at their worst we began things began to get lighter we and people who had been brought to their knees began to stand up and it began to reconst delate and as we reconst delated e after these series of Crisis and I don't know how long they will last I think of this as kind of a three generational pivot I can't imagine it lasting less than that it seems to be the 21st century is a major pivotal point because we know by by 2030 2040 2050 we're going to be getting into worse and worse and wor yes environmental crisis and I think what H what I think is happening is that by the time we go through this crisis will we will crack open something so deep in the human spirit so deep in the human psyche that what will emerge is a literally transformed Humanity not simply transformed individuals but a transformation of the fundamental substructure of the human psyche I think of this as a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective unconscious so that every human being born after this period of History will be experiencing Consciousness within the context of a collective psyche that is different than how we were experiencing it in the 19th and 20th Century now or for a long time before that within our long time before that yeah now there's another theme that came came in where it gave me some of the details of what the future human is and and in other sessions I was taken far into the future and experienced the this archetypal new archetype of the future human but in a very profound experience I had an experience of of I believe in reincarnation I my first book was on reincarnation I think the empirical evidence for reincarnation from a philosopher's perspective is overwhelming that's I'll put those cards on the table it's always been part of my thinking while I went into these sessions based on the evidence not because of religious beliefs and I experienced reincarnation Dynamics many times in my sessions not only my personal reincarnational history but I experience reincarnation as a dynamic process for the entire planet the entire species is pulsing in the rhythm of reincarnation and if that's true that reincarnation is a basic fact of life then we have been we have been building the future human for hundreds of thousands of years we have been growing bit by bit bit by bit bit by bit we remember our former lives usually when we die and we return to the domain of the soul but I think we are coming into a point of History where the soul is actually coming becoming conscious inside our historical existence and the way I experienced this was one day in my session former lives were coming into me just coming into me and it was like wrapping bright white light filament around a kite spool and there came a moment where they seemed to hit critical mass and when they hit critical mass they fused into one and when they fused into one there was an explosion of diamond light from my heart and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness where I was an individual but I was Far Beyond Chris Bas I was an individual like I had never known individuality before and I came to call this the birth of the diamond Soul now many people are experiencing this they give it different names the how I call it is simply my way of languaging at the birth of the diamond soul and I think what's happening is that the soul which is the Consciousness that holds all our former life history is waking up inside our historical existence and is supplanting egoic existence so that we have lived egoic existence for thousands and thousands of years but now the ego has driven the planet into Redline conditions into unacceptable stressful conditions and now we either grow up or we go extinct and what growing up amounts to I think is owning the Deep history and the Deep Consciousness which is our truer nature it's all Divine of course but the form of the Divine is our soulle nature and it's not just individuals I mean who are waking up but now nature is putting enormous pressure to wake up the entire species the entire species is become a species of Christ a species of Buddhas a species of prophets of great spiritual Saints and sages of of History that's the pivot we're trying to make we're trying to make the pivot of growing up taking the Long View the seven generation view uh really looking at and when the soul wakes up of course the whole our whole history becomes kind of dynamically alive within us we have been male female we have been every race on the planet we've been every religion on the planet all of these relatively and the other species I don't think we're all human absolutely and so I think that's what's happening and I think we are being brought to a critical Choice Point uh driven by the ecological crisis and the other systemic crises which are contingent upon the economic realities of the past we're coming into a meltdown point of those realities a choice point so definitely I totally take what you're saying and I would agree with it if somebody is listening to this podcast pretty much by definition they still have an amount of resource and privilege because they have the time and the resources to do that yeah it and I hear you that this is perhaps a three generation span but I'm wondering where we are in those three generations we might not be the first or the three generations alive on the planet at the moment the the kind of Boomers CH X CH Zed but then all the others that we've got more than three generations alive yeah anybody listening wherever they are in the span of age or gender or race what would you recommend as clearly we don't have a formula go and do this and this and this but the concepts within which they could prioritize life this is we're this is going out on New Year's Day so what do we do for what do we create as our sole as in s so priorities for 2025 that would help to move this process forward Yeah couple of quick background assumptions that I make one is that this is a transition which will take the entire resources of the Human family it so there is no one formula it'll take everything we have everything we are it'll take scientific knowledge economic knowledge political skills educational skills medical skills it'll take everything we have to move us through second thing is my assumption is and this is based upon years of studying the past life literature that each one of us has chosen where and when to Incarnate with a certain prevision of what we're getting into to and what will be the dominant themes of that Incarnation and the resources available within that Incarnation that this is part of our incarnational psychic makeup and that means each one of us is already positioned by the Soul by our soul to make a contribution to this transition that we are coming into so it's not a matter of looking around outside of oneself for somewhere else it's a matter of looking deeply into where we are what we are the key question is not so much what can I do the key question I think is will we have the courage to do what is within my reach to do that's the key question if everybody does what is within their reach to do we will make it through this now going One Step Beyond that there are many people I think who are giving us good wise Elder advice on how to engage this moment in history how to move it forward uh very simply put I believe one of the ways to do this is to become what you believe the planet needs right now to become it in your own personal life to be to internalize the beliefs the habits of mind the generos it of heart the clarity of our thinking and our social skills and in Social Community networks to become what the planet needs if you have a clear understanding of what the planet needs and we begin to do that then we become kind of a microcosm of the whole evolutionary pivot and what is alive within us stimulates and activates what is the people around us who are struggling to do the same thing so we're all in this together our arms are all interl one cell awakens another cell right right yes the Field Effect you were talking about earlier if we can come into alignment connect to the Web of Life ask what do you want to me and be that yeah then that in itself ripples out and it stops our head Minds having to plan which seems to me quite a letting letting heart mind lead and head mind follow an inversion of how we' got here but seems to me quite important that's so for example we think that the future human the planet needs more of a heart based epistemology a heart-based source of action and so to put the heart mind kind of ahead of the the Mind mind the Mind head mind that's a reading of what's emerging of what we need to do right right and and our understanding May yet evolve I wouldn't say that's necessarily an end point but it's it's a starting place to move from here this is Chris I learning deep biomimicry learning The rhythms of nature learning what's alive and what's in the in the physical world in the animal world and the world of insects everything around us understanding how we have created imbalance how we can restore systems how to create harmony with those systems how to learn from the engineering that nature has already accomplished through billions of years of evolution within those systems so many ways yeah and and I'm thinking healing the trauma if Francis Weller is right and we are the trauma culture and the indigenous peoples are are a more whole version of humanity we have 10,000 years of ancestral trauma and potentially previous life trauma and it seems to me that I I end up talking sometimes with people who are Fixit on healing their ancestors and I am increasingly feeling that if I can heal in the moment yeah that that ripples up and down the timeline that time is not necessarily one linear thing chunked into identical portions but that healing now if I can become a fully realized human being yeah that ripples to my parents and their parents and their parents all the way back down the line and I don't have physical descendants but down a spirit descendant line and that that saves me feeling that I have to heal 10,000 years of ancestors which is a big ask and quite demoralizing how does that land it lands well now within a reincarnational framework we add the writer that we were our ancestors so we can think of our ancestors in this way we were our ancestors so when we're healing our ancestors in part we're healing our own lineage but anybody worth their salt any mother any father worth their salt who sees a child which is not their own in need in pain actually reaches out to to help heal that child so healing once you really immerse yourself in that process the boundaries of healing expand uh it that healing the trauma of ancestors healing the traumas of your neighbors healing the trauma of actually creating traumala societies for our future children it's it's all good work it's all hard work and it's the work of the hour isn't it right and people I have a suspicion are going to be emailing me afterwards asking where they can get enough LSD to start in the process read the book first people because Chris did things that that the rest of us I don't necessarily think we want to do but psychedelics are big now is it your belief that everyone should be within a structured and held way and with suitable reflection exploring psychedelics or is it that a critical mass does that and the effect rolls out to the rest of us I don't think it's wise for everybody to to have a value that everybody should try psychedelics get into psychedelics uh psychadelics are basically amplifiers of Consciousness they amplify Consciousness what you do with those Amplified states of awareness in those precious hours really determines the value how you use them you can use them Rec recreationally you can go to a Grateful Dead concert you can talk with some friends or you can use them to expose Your Shadow to to heal your Shadow and to move into deeper cosmological exploration but many of us are caring tensions within our psyche which should not be Amplified and this I mean Carl Yung uh would listen to people's dreams on their first day when they came to work with them and he wouldn't work with some people because he knew that they were not ready to undertake the depth of work that would emerge working with him and I think this is true for psychedelics there are some people who should there are a lot of people who should not use psychedelics the the circumstances the patterns of their Consciousness currently it's too strong a medicine they need a gentler way in slower way in uh but among people who are uh say basically healthy a healthy psyche we're not carrying do you know anyone who has a healthy psyche I know some who have a healthier psyche Health yes yes I'm thinking of a lot of my friends who are just really wounded guys I think a lot of people that I know have of healthier psyches but I think all of us are carrying quite deep Frozen Parts still and if you go in if you're work and choose to work with psychedelics I would say very controlled circumstances you know you really want to batten down the hes carefully before you set out into the deep water uh very conscientious uh control of dose first purity of substance because that's always an issue and you know pure substance because a lot of crap comes in what you get on the street uh pure substances careful containers therapeutic structure you know therapeutically monitored structured experiences groups are are I don't think it's good to do what I did to work solo uh it adds unnecessary burden it's good to have a group even though you were held by the person who held you you weren't completely Sol I was held by I wasn't totally alone I was held by my wife uh Carol that my and who was a PHD psychologist but it wasn't healthy in the sense that I didn't have a group that I could share my experiences with beyond that inner circle I wasn't able to talk about it and to take in other people's experiences until way too far down the road so you know iasa communities psilocybin communities where people can work journey together process together be a mirror to each other help expose the the shadow in their post session personalities the greatest danger of working with psychedelics is psychic inflation right you can think that because I have become God and now I can tell you everything yeah yeah exactly just because you've had a special experience you think you're a special person uh and you know it that's just a big fallacy um yeah there's a few I scares in the incoming Administration in the US or at least not iOS scares but people who have taken iOS in the incoming Administration in the US and yeah I'm sure they're wonderful human beings but they and break everything yeah and I think uh one of the things that I heard from an iosa who has spent very large amounts of time in the forest is that Western people tend to want to come in do it and go away again and don't want to spend the weeks and months of really getting to know the plant and and letting go of the ego it's yeah it's a process not an event process we're not used to that in our culture and let me recommend a book on iasa to your read to your audience and that is Bill Barnard's book published by Columbia University press which is insignificant and his book is liquid light and Bill is a university professor at Southern Methodist University he had several books to under his belt he's a very well recognized uh philosopher of religion he has a book on William James a book on hre beron but the book liquid light tells a story of years and years and years decades of going down to South America living in the in the Sant Dam Community working every sabatical on every vacation with his teachers there and it it's a it's an analysis of the Santi diic community and it's also an analysis of his own experiences in the Santi diic community so it's another academic becoming autobiographical without being trapped within his personal story and and it's specifically focused and he is a beautiful writer and these experiences are very powerful brilliant I will find that and put it in the show notes I could go on forever we are heading towards the end of time yeah um the end of our time not necessarily the end of all time a number of questions with all of the coders of what we just said it strikes me that you are probably familiar Now with an emerging network of people who are working together together with a variety of different psychedelic substances are you seeing networks of Consciousness such that people are this is about to sound really flaky but a lot of the push that I'm getting is to do the work so I can actually connect with all of my students in the dream in a way that we're both fully aware of not I just get an email going I saw you in the dream last night you did this and I think well that's really nice but I have no awareness of that um that we move to methods of human networking that are similar to but beyond the digital networking that we just moved into within the last 20 years yeah are you seeing anything approaching that or if not would you like to speak to what is happening in terms of a collective Community if anything yeah well I first I want to own my limitations in that even though I've published this book and even though I speak at some conferences I don't speak at most psychedelic conferences because my work is pretty radical and the focus on the Psychedelic Renaissance right now is on therapy and careful scientific studies demonstrating the the the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics and that's perfectly fine that's that's where we need to be but there the movement is not yet pushing the cosmological territory that I pushed in my work yeah it'll get there there must be somebody somewhere it can't be the just you did it well people like Bill barard and there are people but I think a lot of it is still underground at this point um so I am aware of certain Trends in the Renaissance community and in the Psychedelic Community but I I don't have a Catholic comprehensive breath of access to what's happening so I you know I worked in isolation my work is unusually intense and extreme and I I live basically a pretty quiet life around that but what I do see and and there are some people doing as you're describing cultivating kind of communities of of um paranormal contact within the dream state extended dreaming uh doing different things there are people who are working in meditation trying to integrate psychedelics into meditation circles uh there's a lot there's a lot going on a lot moving I think uh the internet is a physical manifestation in a sense the the hardwires of an emerging of this emerging field Consciousness so that even if we don't accomplish these networks psychically we certainly can we're on a network right now we're this is a Global Network that we're part of it is but somebody could pull a plug on it tomorrow if China or Russia or somebody decides to just switch it or or monitor it such that it's not safe to say anything outside a certain narrow bandwidth could be it could vanish the freedom that we have just now is not is not a given I would say whereas if we could talk to each other without needing the internet it would be quite hard to interfere with that it would be great that the complication of course is the clarity of the transmission the purity of the transmission because the personal psyche throws up all sorts of filters uh sure does yeah yeah ego gets in the way basically head mind gets in the way yeah yeah okay uh I think we never got to actually you said I'll come to it later of why I stopped did you feel that you covered that did you want to cover that if not is there anything else that you feel we could usefully cover in the time that we've got well that's actually might be a good place to to wrap up some of the discussion and uh because it's relevant uh to where we might go uh I stopped for two reasons I stopped first uh because my physical system the my subtle Energy System my Prana or Chi Energy System was running so hot after all these years of practice that uh it was producing certain physical symptoms that was leaving me continually physically uncomfortable uh and I describe these in the book but basically I understood enough about pronic energy and arotic medicine and to understand what was happening and I was just running too much energy but that's not the major reason I stopped the major reason I stopped was heartache that is it was getting increasingly difficult to come back from the deep state of ecstatic Transcendent immersion in the Divine fabric to come out of that back into my time space reality and there are beings there are great beings who are able to sustain that those transcendental States in their time space personality they are great Masters and truly all honor to the great Masters I'm not one of those beings this is a path of temporary immersion that's different than the path of contemplative presence so I can go into those States but I have to come out of them and eventually coming back out just became too painful of a separation so uh I stopped and I knew I would be stopping for the rest of my life because it takes years and years of momentum to develop the energy to break into these high high energy states I could if I did a massive dose of LSD right now I would not be able to go back to where I was working at the end of my 20year journey yeah so I knew I was stopping for the rest of my life but it was important for me to stop uh and I had to First learn how to manage the heartache and then to begin the process of working the slower process of integrating those living memories actively living memories into my physical existence which conversations like this actually help me do so it's a very it's healing for me to talk about these things with you um so and the way that this applies to maybe some of your listeners is to be careful about how much you bite off in your sessions because even if you're really committed to conscientious integration you can bite off more than you can chew or more than it's wise for you to chew so I think we can learn a lot from the contemplative Traditions it's one of the advantages I had going into this work I was teaching courses in mysticism and meditation teaching courses in Shamanism and Buddhism so I I understood the literature of mysticism I understood the practices of mysticism the purification processes and I and I tried to use those processes in my own work and and there's a lot of wisdom there so it's it serves you to be well read and and I think to recognize the limitations of anyone Incarnation I think that in some ways I went to places that were so deep it will take me not just one Incarnation but multiple incarnations to truly integrate them and by that I mean being able to manifest those levels of a Consciousness inside my my physical Consciousness comfortably okay right yes yes so I I would basically hate for anyone to try to do what I did and get into trouble and hurt themselves that would just break my heart yeah yeah I I think we've we've got the the health warnings fairly clear on here if you're going to work with things work with somebody who knows really what they're doing um me and my Apprentice are are working too fun find people that we can pass people on to because we get emails saying I took substance X and basically I'm having a psychotic breakdown what can I do and we're shanic practitioners actually it's not our field so we're trying to pass this on to people who can actually help but they're few and far between because there's a lot more people who think they can help than the ones who can actually help so take great care find test your people out before you decide to do something that is irreversible I would say it's really clear and then do the work beforehand and do the work during and do the work after after to integrate and integrate and integrate and do it because you're doing it in service to life and not because you're trying to make your ego feel happy strikes me as a quite important one have I missed anything out on the health world I think it's great and if you do your work well one of the things that happens is you lose all fear of death you once you transition several times into that reality you know in your bones from your own experience that death is not an end of anything it's simply an end of an incarnational cycle and there is absolutely nothing to fear about death death is homecoming all of the Hollywood that are thrown up at us for you know Dark Places and demons and ghosts and all this stuff it's just nonsense 99% of people die and make a transition into the light perfectly naturally and comfortably if you are afraid of dying you've got your entire metaphysics upside side down death is homecoming death is the end of your this matriculation it's the harvesting of your life birth should be mourned and birth is where the work begins it's like being a freshman in college it's hard graduation is wonderful right and when you lose your fear of death and you begin to understand the deeper [Music] meaningful challenges which are embedded in our time space experiences then the whole if you lose your fear of death your whole game of Life Changes because death is what people fear more than anything else and if you don't have that fear then you're you're going into a different life style a different way of living uh a more Joyful Way of living yes yes thank you thank you that feels to me a fantastic place to end does that feel good to you it feels good to me all right in that case Chris thank you so much for coming on to The Accidental God podcast this has been an absolute Delight I have enjoyed every moment and I think what a way to start the year thank you thank you Manda and thank you for your work we need all of the awareness that we can bring to ourselves and you are certainly bringing awareness to many people thank you thank you</p></body></html>

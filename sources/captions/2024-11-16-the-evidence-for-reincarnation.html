community group and our speaker tonight is I'm very excited to have Chris bash PhD back to talk about another of his areas of contemplation which he wrote about in his book life cycles a study of reincarnation reincarnation is a topic that I'm sure people have different ideas about either believing disbelieving or curious based on my own contemplation in my younger years and subsequent personal experiences including a past life regression in my 20s I'm in The Believer Camp Chris who was our speaker a couple of years ago was just um wonderful and as we've said in our check-ins that everyone a lot of people have read his book and been very appreciative of the the work that he did and and the and the work that he wrote about Chris is a professor em Emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years he's also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of integral studies a Meritus fellow at The Institute of noetic Sciences on the board of the grath Legacy training an award-winning teacher and international speaker Chris has written four books life cycles about reincarnation Dark Knight early Dawn about pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy the living classroom and exploration of collective fields of Consciousness in teaching and LSD in the mind of the universe the story of his 20-year Journey with LSD which is a fabulous book Chris lives in Weaverville North Carolina with his wife Christina Hardy a professional astrologer and past life therapist so Chris take it away and thank you for being here hi everybody sure is nice nice to see you and thank you for all of your warm greetings they really touched my heart um and I hope we have a lot of fun today I'm looking forward today and because many of you know my work I just want to show you something which I think you'd like to see you know in 19 in 2008 I wrote The Living classroom I talked about FS of Consciousness the transmission energetic transmission I never me I never mentioned psychedelics didn't I didn't mention anything about my psychedelic work uh now Sunni is bringing out that book in a new edition so this is the new edition just out this coming month and it's in expensive in hardback but ebook it's out in ebook and it'll be in paperback in a year this is the true edition of the living classroom this time they gave me permission to talk about psychedelics so this time I'm actually saying I was a university Professor for 20 years I was taking these large doses of LSD in therapeutic setting and uh this is what happened with my students and this is the theory of of un of classrooms and feels of Consciousness that came out of it so just to share that with you because this a special joy and it it kind of deepens the final puts the final Stitch into bringing back together the two halves of my life that I had to separate in order to do the Psychedelic work in order to stay a university professor in the world but to do this work I had to let them separate now they're coming back together again late in my life but before I published in psychedelics I tackled what I thought was really a really important uh fundamental question dividing World philosophies and that is reincarnation if you believe this is the only life we got you're going to go down a certain direction if you believe we have multiple lifetimes you're going to go down a different direction seem to be a fundamental thing and the amazing thing is after I got out of graduate school and after I started teaching and I started to read around more I found that we had an amazing body of evidence that documents that this is a a true and legitimate part of life none of my graduate courses had taken reincarnation seriously you know not this not the Western religions that I had studied not the scientific Traditions that had displaced those traditions in my mind and here was Ian Stevenson at University of Virginia proving that reincarnation is a fact of life I had to race my entire intellectual Blackboard and start over again because if reincarnation is a fact of nature then we're living in a much different Universe than I had thought we were living in before so my entire life has kind of been unfolding an understanding of what it's like just like we see we see plate tectonics now and we see galaxies giving birth to stars and we see planets terraforming now there is this understanding that reincarnation is part of how Nature has carried forward and advanced the learning of individuals within certain species up to that point in time evolution is caring for forward the learning of entire groups forward into more groups and more groups but eventually there reaches a point where individuality matures and nature has found a way to fold individual learning forward into cascading uh accumulations of knowledge and wisdom and experience okay so uh my first sabatical I wrote life cycles and it starts with a chapter on the evidence for reincarnation and then it goes on to look at say so what if reincarnation is true what does it say about our relationships what does it say about family what does it say about larger patterns so uh so what I'd like to do tonight is share with you this lecture on Gathering Together the scientific evidence for reincarnation now it turns out I gave a good lecture on this topic at an intern European gathering World Congress on on Consciousness and it's 35 minutes long so what I'd like to do is play that and let that carry the water for taking you through the evidence I can't say it better than I said it here and I was younger had more energy was a stage and it worked well and then after 35 minutes I'll catch it finish it out and then we've got all the time remaining for questions question and answers okay all right so let's hope the technology gods are with us fingers crossed everybody all right I hope you're seeing what I'm seeing which is all right large screen and I hope the Sound Works there we go okay okay now if I can make this if the most important philosophical question one can ask in life is do we survive the death of our body which Dr Van loml is asking I think the second most important question is do we live once or do we live more than once and it all hinges on time the problem the significances of time as a teacher if I give a quiz I have a right to expect a certain performance from the students if I give an hour exam I have a right to expect a higher level of performance and if I give a take-home research paper I expect a higher level of performance because they have more time if this universe If This Magnificent universe that we are in has a purpose then as a philosopher we can we have to measure the purpose of the universe proportionate to the time we have to fulfill that purpose if we only live one time then we might extrapolate or estimate or calculate the purpose of existence to be but if we live 100 times if we live a thousand times if we live 10,000 times if our participation in This Magnificent universe is truly open-ended then we have a very different relationship with the universe and then we have a reason to think about the possible purpose of existence in a completely different framework and the religions of the last 4,000 years have had a tendency to not value physical existence they've had a tendency to say well you achieve realization you achieve enlightenment and then you leave Nirvana samsara you escape samsara Moka Escape or you achieve salvation and then you leave but that leaves the fundamental question what is the purpose of the universe unanswered what is the purpose of my physical existence in the universe but if we come back if we come back to this life many times then we have a different story that begins to unfold and it doesn't I think it I think our understanding of reincarnation is completely incomplete at this point just as we've begun to understand the true depth and breadth of the universe that we are part of likewise when we begin to understand that we participate we're dancing with this universe for extended period of time then we have a deeper understanding of what the universe might actually be trying to accomplish in us and what might be our gift to the universe in the continual refinement and compounding of our talent over time so what I'd like to do today is talk about the evidence for reincarnation and I've been thinking about this and been in this game for a long time the first book I I wrote uh it was is life cycles and notice how long ago I wrote it it was the first book I wrote as an academic and that is a signal of how important I think this topic is and that there is good critical empirical evidence that allows us to decide this topic if there weren't critical evidence then it would just be a wasted exercise and I think this evidence did not exist 50 years ago and the theologians used to debate about reincarnation go round and round but today we have a different body of physical of of empirical evidence on reincarnation that has moved the topic from the theologians table to the psychologist table to the the philosopher table to the to the psychiatrist table and that's what I'd like to take you through some today now when looking at the evidence for reincarnation we can either look at go small or go large we either look at the detailed cases in or we look at the larger body of literature the Beauty and the real Joy is in the detailed cases but in 45 minutes I've chosen to go large what I would really like to do is in encourage you today to read one book on reincarnation that you haven't read yet and so I want to take you into some of the literature on reincarnation and show you some of the patterns that are emerging in the literature and rebirth okay ready to go let's go 20 cases suggestive of reincarnation by Ian Stevenson this is a book that changed my life because like many people when I finished graduate school in 1978 I was an atheistically inclined uh agnostic I was trained in philosophy of religion but all that training basically made me an atheist but when I encountered this book right after finishing graduate school he turned my life around because he convinced me that there was evidence that we live on life more than once he is the uh okay oh good Sten Stevenson is the Carlson Professor was the Carlson Professor from the University of Virginia between 1967 and 2001 he has written 11 books on reincarnation some of the most important are these cases of reincarnation type written over a seven-year period from 73 to 84 unlearned language Languages by children about children who have an ability to speak a language which no one in their family speaks no one in their entire town speaks sometimes an ancient language children who remember previous lives and his last book his monum Opus a 1,00 page two volume work a study of 187 cases of children who not only have detailed memories of their most previous of their immediate life but actually carry the scars in their body which relate to the death wounds of the body in their previous personality and that of course really upsets academics I mean it it's one thing to have continuity of memory that's bad enough but to suggest that a wound of death can actually be transferred into the physical body of a subsequent personality that drives my colleagues right up a wall but 187 cases well documented case histories it's a magnificent book what are we looking at with Stephenson we're looking at cases of children from around the world who have detailed recall of their most immediate recent life they know their way around towns that they've never been in before they can recognize persons when they're brought into the life place of the previous personality they can recog recognize persons that they have never met before they know the personal history their personal history with that person they had the appropriate emotional responses with that person husbands for wives children you have cases of a 5-year-old child who is showing all the feelings of the husband of a 35y old woman with all the emotional responses there is one case of a child called parad when he was reunited with the family of the previous personality he was very shy around the wife of the previous personality he wouldn't identify her until she left the room but then he identified her and then later he took her aside and he said two things to her he said I've come but you've not fixed Bindy which is the spot that Indian women wear on their for as an indication that they're married and he also criticized her for wearing a white sari instead of a colorful sari in the tradition in India is when you become a widow you don't wear color from the rest of your life you wear only white essentially this 5-year-old boy was saying to this 35y old woman I've come but you're acting like we you're not married they know the inner architecture of homes that they've never been in they know people who owed them money when they died and the debt had not been collected in one case this little child was brought back to the home of the previous personality and the wife of the previous personality said okay if you're my husband where did you put the will we couldn't find the will the little boy walked over to a floorboard in the kitchen pulled up the floorboard and pulled the wheel out of this little secret place that only he knew about in the floor of the kitchen cases like that drive my philosophical colleagues at the University right up a wall they don't know what to do with it it's hard for them to deny it but there it is some patterns in the data the average time interval between the death of the first personality and the birth of the second personality Stevens finds about two and a half years the average distance between the life place of the first personality and the life place of the second personality 50 miles and these children tend to lose their memories around the year around eight years old when they become begin to get into school and in a more complex social environment they basically forget they lose their memory so we're looking at a a small time window from research from about three years old to eight years old a five minute time window to get to these children and document their Memories the remaining 90% forget them by the time they're eight the remaining 10% vast majority of those forget them when they hit puberty when they hit puberty you know all hell breaks loose and they forget their subtle traces of their former lives Stephenson asks why do these children remember what most of us forget and his answer is he doesn't know we need more research it's all research he has a hypothesis he points out that about 60% of these children died violently in their previous life the remaining 40% died either early suddenly or with an acute sense of unfinished business like a mother who dies shortly after the birth of her baby his hypothesis is maybe there's something about the trauma of being wrenched from Life violently suddenly with an acute sense of unfinished business that encodes the the Consciousness in a way that draws them back faster than usual and closer than usual because this time I don't have time to give all the evidence but this two and a half and 50 two and a half years 50 miles is faster than the population at large and closer to home than the population at large in reviewing 20 cases suggestive of reincarnation the Journal of American Medical Association wrote Stevenson has painstakingly and unemotionally collected a detailed series of cases in which the evidence for reincarnation is difficult to understand on other grounds two years later the Journal of nervous and mental disease a major psychiatric journal in the United States P published an entire Journal devoted to Stevenson's cases and that it was such an unusual move that they published an editorial to justify or to explain their rationale and in the editorial they wrote our decision to publish this material recognizes the legitimacy of his research methods and the Conformity of his reasoning to the usual Cannons of rational thought that's the way an academic qualifies their endorsement now the philosophical institution the Guardians of uh orthodox are not going to let Stevenson get away with this not without a fight and he has had his critics and the most important critic is a man named uh Paul Edwards and I promise you this is the best picture I could find of Paul Edwards online his book Reincarnation of Critical examination Paul Edwards was an a major American philosopher he taught at the new school for social research he's best known for having been the editorinchief of the eight volume Encyclopedia of philosophy so he's a major heavyweight in the philosophical tradition he wrote a series of Articles uh in 1986 to 87 the four-part article uh on reincarnation and eventually he published these articles in a later form in this book reincarnation and his he is the harshest critic of Steven he accuses Stevenson of fraud he accuses Stevenson of not being sufficiently rigorous in his analysis of the data he accuses re Stephenson of not actually verifying that he thinks that there could have been contact between the two families that Stephenson isn't really critical in proving that these families the first and second personality have never had contact but there's actually a deeper you know to accuse someone of bad research and to prove bad research is two different things and if you go through Stephenson's arguments very carefully I'm sorry Edward's arguments very carefully you see that there's kind of a deeper logic operating in his work he says reincarnation would represent a crucifixion of our understanding and by our understanding he means secular humanism the philosophical scientific tradition the Newtonian Cartesian philosophical tradition he says if you believe in reincarnation you must accept what he calls six collateral assumptions and these collateral assumptions are that materialism is false that that mind is not reducible to brain that our identity is more than our personality that there is a domain other than SpaceTime that death is an illusion that there may be a deeper logic to our lives Edward says these assumptions are surely fantastic if not indeed nonsense and even in the absence of a demonstration of specific flaws a rational person will conclude either that Stevenson's reports are seriously defective or that his alleged facts can be explained without bringing in reincarnation well I won't go over Edward's arguments more carefully because Robert Robert almader has done this for us Robert almader is another U major American philosopher he is professor ameritus at Georgia State University he is authored a co-authored 24 books he wrote this book in which he is evalu valuating five categories of evidence for survival of death the major analysis he's doing in this book is the debate between Stephenson and Edwards and what he shows by analyzing edwards's argument is that Edwards does not refute Stephenson's argument what he does is refus to even look at it seriously because he is so convinced that it must be false he says his argument constitutes a blatant bit of question begging because he always assumes precisely what is in contention what is in contention is can Consciousness exist without a brain and because he believes that science has proven that Consciousness can exists without a brain therefore we know that there must be something wrong with the evidence Al says if you have a very commanding argument that you C that you cannot refute then not to accept the argument is to act irrationally Stephenson's tradition continues even though he's passed on he's now looking from the bleacher seats watching us in there this book by Tom schroer old souls Tom schroer wins the definitely wins for having the award for having the worst cover of any book in reincarnation research but Tom is an interesting guy he's a reporter he's a Pitzer prizewinning reporter he's also one of the editors for the Washington Post a major American newspaper and he was interested in whether Stephenson's research could stand up to a critical reporter's eye so he went with Stephenson on one of his trips around the world studying these small children he looked over his shoulder and he came away convinced as the subtitle shows compelling evidence from children who remember past lives convinced that this Stephenson's methods were good the data would stand up these children were real this is a compelling case for reincarnation and at the University of Virginia Stephenson's work continues in the person of Jim Tucker who has now inherited Stevenson's chair this book is a wonderful book it's very much in the Stevenson tradition continuing to look in detail the detail cas and explaining why these cases cannot be attributed to weaker hypotheses like superi or something like this I might mention that Jim Tucker's book is a lot easier to read than Stephenson's book Stephenson writes and thinks like a lawyer it's very good but it's very very detailed very dry Jim trucker brings a little more life to the subject matter now everything we've been looking at so far has to do with what I would call the evidence from spontaneous memories just children who spontaneously have memories of previous life but there's another body of evidence you have to approach it with a different framework it's evoked memories memories which have been evoked in some way different techniques uh even massage can evoke a former life memory but the most common one that we're familiar with is hypnotherapy some type of hypnosis the following cases following books are representative titles of people who have worked in the field of past life therapy my favorite book written by a single therapist who has worked in the area of past life therapy and has thought about it a great deal is this book by Roger wer notice a date an earlier book other lives other cells started as a yion ended up in past life therapy doing past life's work even though Carl Young I don't know whether you you probably know he himself believed in reincarnation towards the later years of his life but he kind of kept it quiet this is a wonderful book intellectually totally competent uh a wonderful review of detailed cases and a discussion of the implications of these cases past life therapy began to really explode in the 70s 80s and there were a lot of therapists who were concerned that there was not a graduate school there was no curriculum there was no agreed upon curriculum for how to establish the credentials for people who wanted to do past life therapy and this task was taken on by wiford Lucas who wrote a magnificent two volume Anthology which is a compendium of essays and articles of the best of the best of the people working at that time in past life therapy so if you wanted to read a single book I would read wier's book by one author but if you wanted to see an overview of multiple people writing in the field I would go to winifer Lucas's book regression therapy a handbook for professionals Carol Bowman was a social worker she wasn't interested in past life therapy she got into it because her son started having nightmares he started waking up with very disturbing nightmares and she approached him she tried to work with him took him to therapist tried to do conventional things but it didn't work and then she began to do her homework she began to look into past life therapy began to learn the field and she began to help her own child solve his own trauma carried over from a previous life that was B spontaneously bubbling up in his life she began to attract other people with other children who were also having problems and eventually she wrote this beautiful book specifically a therapeutic book for parents who have children who are having traumatic memory surface that they're having difficulty dealing with was very successful uh very persuasive it really made had a lot of impact she got more business coming in she wrote a second book she gets the award for the second worst title a cover on reincarnation book returned from Heaven she's looking specifically at relatives who have been reincarnated within their own families now as a philosopher that's a weaker body of evidence right because there's so much potential for contamination if you're remembering your grandfather but as a father this is interesting it's interesting because reincarnation simply doesn't happen where it's works well for the researchers across great distances and great families but inside families is a very common occurrence and therefore it deserves to be looked at and next Michael Newton two wonderful books and I must confess us special partiality if you want to read some if you wanted to just pick out one or two books out of this entire list I can't help but wish that you would read Michael Newton's work Michael Newton was a hypnotherapist who got into past life therapy and he was doing past life therapy and then he accidentally discovered that his clients in deep hypnosis had the ability not only to remember their previous life but to remember what happened to them after they died they could remember basically his clients were beginning to describe the afterlife and he thought he didn't think this was possible but he followed his clients a good therapist that he is and he took hundreds of people into deep hypnotic regressions and he followed them when they would go through their former life and they would go through the death experience he would follow them into their memories continuing on and then he would ask them questions and he kept detailed notes he would ask questions about what was this what was going on what was it like and what he found was regardless of what background people came from whatever their cultural inculturation was fundamentalist Baptist car Marxist atheist hardcore scientific reductionist whatever their background was people were describing the same fundamental reality in the after death State they were describing a world that had order that had structure that had logic there was actually a social structure it was a world in which older Learners taught younger Learners and it was also a world where people made the choice to reincarnate as a conscious careful decision it's one of the most important choices you make if you go to college what courses you sign up for that's an important choice once you sign up for a course you're committed for the entire semester when you incarnate what life you take on is an important choice and Michael Newton found that in fact in the spiritual world the choice of what life to take is a consciously taken Choice made under the guidance of your spiritual helpers and made in cooperation with the other persons that you're going to be incarnating with so before we knew before we were born when we knew more than we know now when we were aware of more than we are aware now we chose the life that we are living now that fact alone just Bears deep meditation two last examples not from professionals they're from amateurs but that's what makes them interesting the first is this book looking for Carol Beck and what makes it interesting is the man who wrote it Robert snow because Robert snow is the commander of the homicide division of the Indianapolis Police Department all right so he's chief of detectives of he investigates murders his opinion is very important it must stand up in court he would be the last person that you would think would be doing research on a former life but it happened that he kind of he did a Hypno a hypnotic s not oriented towards past lives he just kind of on a a lark he did the a hypnotic session and in this hypnotic session he was HD in the face with a life that appeared to be his life but it was it it scared him to death and he literally ran out of the room but he was curious and so he brought all of his detective skills to the systematic search to see if he could identify and track down whether there was such a person and the story of his experience and the story of his detective work is told in this short book uh looking for Carol Beckwith and lastly this book Soul Survivor which you may have seen it because they did some news Clips decent news Clips on it written by Bruce and Andrea linger about their son James and this is a case of a child three years old two years old who started having spontaneous memories and and Trauma waking up crying in the middle of the night spontaneous memories of appear apparently dying in World War II as an airplane pilot over the co over the coast of Japan and uh his father was a fundamentalist Baptist and he was absolutely vehemently opposed to his son reincarnating mother was a little more receptive so they got involved and first they wanted to help their son but he got involved in the the inquiry because he wanted to disprove reincarnation whatever was going on with James he wanted to disprove reincarnation to protect his faith in the end they tracked down this pilot they tracked down the story they were able to reunite James with the people at a military reunion with the people who had served with this pilot and James was able to identify people on this group The Father became convinced that in fact his son was The Reincarnation of this pilot and reincarnation is true now I'd like to just finish with two two observations quick observations as lunch awaits I'd like to emphasize what we don't know about reincarnation the evidence for reincarnation May be compelling however we don't really know a lot about how reincarnation takes place or what the physics of rebirth is we're still beginners in this at this point we can't say what the soul is or what it's made of how does it come and go from the physical body how does it interface with our biology and our genetic makeup how does it encode its previous learning into to our present body and how does it leave with its learning intact after we die these things right now are beyond our present grasp I'm sure we'll make progress in the future but before we do we're going to have to start we're going to have to stop reducing mind to brain and we're going to be have to approach this research with a more multi-dimensional metaphysical cosmology and lastly I'd like to point to a certain Paradox in the evidence and to do this Paradox I need to go really go back to Ian Stevenson Stephenson's evidence I think is the most powerful evidence for reincarnation and his evidence liberates our thinking at one level but it also constricts our thinking at another because the the strongest evidence for reincarnation comes from lives that show the tightest connection the tightest correlation but the correlation can be so tight it can lead if you just study Stephenson's evidence it can lead to a u a anemic an underdeveloped vision of what life is like when we die when most of us die in that respect we must remember that Stevens Skin's cases are not typical cases these children are coming back very fast and very close to home most people spend much more quote time in the Timeless condition of the spirit world World they they have a much wider breath of experiences so Stephenson's evidence liberates us to thinking about the soul and thinking about our lives and thinking about our existence in a much larger expanded framework but in order to actually fill in that canvas in order to actually explore more deeply what happens to us when we die and what the larger circle of life is like from expanding Consciousness to contracted Consciousness and back into expanded Consciousness we need to look at other bodies of data I think Michael Newton's work is an important body of data that gives us a larger vision and this afternoon when I talk about psychedelic research I'll look at another body of data which I think can give us an expanded vision of our life in this universe thank you very much okay that brings us back it brings us back excellent I uh I sure had fun sharing this with you it brings back a lot of memories for me I had a good time with this group of people uh giving this material and now um you have to picture yourself we've just finished this talk I'm walking around on stage with a micro phone waiting for the questions or contributions you'd like to make in the wake of this uh presentation I will just say that my thinking of reincarnation has evolved Beyond where it was when I wrote life cycles I opened up a deeper level of reincarnation thinking in dark night early Dawn when I began to bring in the Psychedelic experience and then in LSD in the mind of the Universe I give the most complete expanded understanding of reincarnation with the birth of the diamond soul with the concept of the birth of the diamond soul in history so but where it all begins is do we have good evidence do we have good reliable evidence that any good hard know skeptic should endorse whether or not they do or not so that's some of the literature and D has a a core bibliography that she's going to hopefully send out to everybody afterward so all the names and places and books that I mentioned are there plus more so you'll get those so now the floor is open yeah so if you'd like to ask a question use the little um hand raise thing down at the bottom let's see which one is it react and raise your hand and we'll call on you Victoria you're the first wow that was very lovely and you you actually answered uh one of my questions was how is your understanding evolved but the the two two questions you talk about um species um reincarnation which I'd love to hear more about that especially given our current situation and I also would like to understand more what you mean when you talk in the book about purification and detoxic ification because that also seems very relevant and and what does that mean for us individually and collectively yeah well when I began my psychedelic work I thought it was about personal transformation personal even maybe personal Enlightenment if I got lucky but then of course what happened is that I dissolv the the method I was using was so powerful it dissolved me so deeply into Collective Consciousness and the collective species mind again and again again that it began to activate Dynamics at a species level and one of the very powerful ones way down the road was actually experiencing it was like I was in deep space and I was experiencing the pulse of Life on our planet and it was a pulse it kind of pulsed every hundred years more or less but it was a pulse of reincarnation and I was experiencing all of human beings as cells in a superorganism and this superorganism was evolving itself through their individual life task it was just it was the most magnificent thing and it was beautiful but it deepened my sense that everything we're doing is part of a larger Collective Dynamic an evolutionary Dynamic everything we're doing is every what we think of as a private is not private everything is wired in into a collective network uh and that's true of reincarnation in general and then in specific things about uh when I went into the ocean of suffering the things we get involved in in deep spiritual work some of it's our personal some of it's former life some of it's not personal at all some of it's just it's larger U cleaning the Bayou now we know from studying mystical autobiographies when an individual is opening to deeper pure more com comprehensive unitive States Of Consciousness those States Of Consciousness are incredibly powerful and pure and they tend to churn up the psyche and bring to the surface all the things that are distorting their natural ability to enter into this awareness so all the bruises and all the cheaty little things and all the little sneaky little things and whatever whatever that kind of mucking us up comes to the surface well if that's and then we process them and as we process them we clear them out we let them go and then our whole psychic system gets cleaner and cleaner and we're able to not only heal but to go into deeper spiritual states of awareness so we know Mystics do this we know medit s do this we know people in Psychotherapy do this turns out that this is also true for the entire species the entire species carries the wounds of its history in its Collective memory banks the entire species has lived all these years of war has died and all these terrible deaths of of of of U plague have have all the mothers who have died in child birth anything which isn't processed out by the present or future life of that Soul stream is still in this Collective psyche and um it still holds Humanity's back if you will it still scares Humanity it still keeps us focused and if humanity is as I think it is in the process of growing up into a deeper existential level of awareness it has to offload all these things which are keeping it small which means it has to purify itself sweat out all the me the first all their pain that we're carrying as a collective all the pain and suffering all the vicious wounding of other being this is coming to the surface in US collectively and as well as individually and if you begin to look like that then there are certain things that you can see happening in a culture which seem to be maybe less as we thought of them before as a lot of individuals manifesting this thing and kind of more as the pulse of a deeper process so I think we are entering a time in history of exponential growth but exponential growth watch out it requires exponential purification exponential detoxification but this is simply how complex systems evolve the El how how we grow so it's it's a very exciting time very challenging time uh time of exponential growth but for that same reason time that calls on the warrior within us the Warriers within us going to be hard times yeah well just it brief well I imagine it can be brief so for me this brings up so much emotion it feels like um patriarchy needs to be within that I needs to be let go of and that seems huge it feels like you kind of alluded to the wrong leaders who knows but it feels like it's been brought up and so can you just give an example of what what does that mean that um because that's huge but minute to minute or what what does that mean to do we just went through this a ction now I'm pretty sure I'm in a safe room but if I AP I if I step on people's political toes I apologize but we had a choice between a man and a woman and a particular kind of man with a particular worldview and a woman with a particular kind of woman a particular world view and collectively we chose I think the worst of the choice we chose aggressively we chose looking backwards we try we chose trying to hold on to what we had instead of facing the uncertainty of the future with vision and courage and so this is going to hurt us for years and years the decisions will be made things will get worse I don't know whether that's a bad thing or a good thing that things are going to get worse faster than if we had had wisdom at the leadership level I don't know but uh I think we're going to find that it will be years before we begin to recognize and recover from the political decisions that will be enacted over the next decade under the influence of this election so I see it as we have Choice points in this process we have Choice points of whether to be wise or whether to be dumb I'm afraid we didn't pass this idea this intelligence choice in our country you know so fingers crossed and hands folded yeah so just so for me individually keep a focus on the kind of person I want to be and is is that rather than going into judgment or grief or outrage one of the things about reincarnation is that it gives everybody permission to to be at the level of Spiritual Development that they are at and you kind of lose the habit of judging other people because you can't judge other people because you don't know what their calling was what their challenge was you don't you just don't know uh you don't know how old they are they could be babies they could be graduate students you just don't know so it leads me to be uh kind of respectfully distant in that way so my focus is do the best I can help the people who see what I see do the best they can together I think we will make a difference and by the way I think as we go into hotter and hotter and I don't mean that temperature- wise but more and more intense destabilization in the future the in the individual can have a significantly greater impact this we've learned from nonlinear systems and and uh Chaos Theory the more intense the more nonlinear a system as has been giant generating in instability because it's absorbing more and more energy it becomes unstable at those highly energized States individuals can have a disproportionate impact you know butterfly flaps at Wings it hurricane and China so there's an interconnection of the web as we go into this crisis each individual will have a greater impact than they might have had a hundred years ago because the whole Foundation is going to be energized Victoria thank you very much thank you for your good questions thank you Jon you're next okay um this has all been wonderful everything I just i' I've so enjoyed listening to you to that that whole presentation that you did and Victoria's questions and your answers and everything and um uh past lifetimes has been so interesting to me and I have asked for lifetimes with certain people I've been wounded I've been actually killed I've been you know set out to die all kinds of things um but right now I am uh get I've been for the last three or four years preparing myself to write um quote Memoir but it's not going to be the usual type of memoir book it'll be in three parts and the first 56 and a half years of course will be the first part and that'll probably be the least amount but I have to write that without judgment Without Blame uh clear and um and so on and so the things that you're saying in terms of what we have to do for ourselves are so it HS home to me to me so much and I'm I'm close to that and I have been close to that for a while but I just had to figure it out in my mind how to say it how to be it how to you know present it and the second part is all of the um all of the esoteric studies ancient wisdom techniques all of that kind of thing past life stuff and everything and the third part is be now Jon sorry to interrupt but do you have a question um uh I think I I I wish I had a question I can't I can't I'm working with all the answers right now and um I guess my question would be I want to make a difference somehow I feel I can do it with my writing uh with the way that I write um the things that I write about and and it's a big big task and I am wondering you know how do I hold that how do I how do I keep that focus in spite of what's going on around us yeah she question the life of a writer is a is a different kind of life isn't it it's like climb the Mountain close the door open the windows but it's a deep inner focus and you hold that Focus for a long time honestly it took me five years at the computer to write LSD in the mind of the universe it took me three years just to get myself in a position of letting people in as deeply as I was going to let them in and then it took decades 20 years just to gather the experiences which I put into that book and so it is it's it's a very intense process and I'd encourage you just trust your calling trust your calling if you feel that that writing is your calling it's your contribution it's what you can give then Buckle in take it as far take it as deep bring it as deeply in forward as possible and then share it with World throw it out there let it go and don't have any attachment to the results you do the best you can you let it go where it will go and that's a great that's that's a great gift yeah I said a very high intention and the other part of that is to not be attached to the outcome that's the other part of the intention but I don't have a long time to do this I'm 83 years old this is something that I'm doing okay for a legacy for my family for one thing but also I I want I want the world to understand so many things that they're missing right now and of course we just came up with a huge challenge in this election a huge huge challenge so this is my way of trying to you know yeah address all of that pressure cooker is on amazing things come out when the pressure is on huh yes TR that yeah if it's an I can do it I know all of this is happening around me but I can do this but I've got to let go of all that other stuff good luck to you fingers crossed looking forward to seeing what you produce thank you and I did read your your life um life cycles but if I had read this step sooner my life would have been totally different but I don't know that I would have wanted it that way because part of what I was doing all those 56 and a half years was it was it was my purpose it was what I had to do to move on thank you Jan so that our next question is Christopher there we go thank you dony um tremendous presentation thank you uh thank you for sharing that it's it's an honor and I wish I I wanted to go on and hear the rest of your lecture as well and I don't know if you still do in-person events or not but it it would be wonderful so um moving forward with the with the question so as a child I was taught that I had sin and therefore I had debt later in life I moved on you know more sophisticated I thought and then I had Karma and again debt right so here we are again um then you know the idea with it reincarnation and Karma became entwined right and it was the idea that since you have Karma um you know you have to reincarnate to keep working on this wheel of karma this reincarnation so I'd be interested in your thoughts about um is karma really entwined with reincarnation um certainly you know for those who have had the experience of meeting divine presence and source and the incredible love um you know life becomes a an honor um you know a tremendous honor to be here so is it you know is it acts of honor and giving back or is it is reincarnation bound to Karma yeah and the second part of that being um more recently I've heard people saying our karma is being lessened and going down and perhaps we're you know if that theory is correct that we're paying that off and maybe in the future we're reincarnating because we don't have Karma anymore show thoughts a lot of questions rolled into those couple of questions yeah uh I think of karma uh let me back I think Karma cause and effect is just part of the process is the physical Universe has a lot of cause and effects running uh the the spiritual conscious Universe has a lot of cause and effect coming but the question is how we interpret that cause and effect pattern and I think we've been kind of interpreting it in too narrow a way for a long time uh in the if you listen to um past life therapy if you read aloud past life therapy you basically could justifiably come away with the conclusion that uh life is basically about healing that we up a lot we got a lot of fix up to do and you could kind of have a negative perception of what carries over from the past there's so much mess up so much cleanup that's needed when in fact I think most people they pass their karmic test most of the kids in the school systems they graduate they go to the next level most people pass their karmic tests and that means we're bringing into our next life not just liabilities we're bringing in assets we're bringing in skills we're bringing in relationships that have matured so if you but the people don't go to therapist to celebrate their victories they go to therapist to heal their wounds so it's okay it's perfectly okay but we just have to remember there's a larger pattern here and so we have to make sure that the story which emerges is not just a story of healing but a story of investing uh in human development and human growth challenging ourselves developing Arts talented knowledge just the enriching of the human spirit that is certainly the larger share of what's happening in reincarnation than simply these these these picking over the bones of a grudge here or Grudge there now if you look at religion I think there's been a similar kind of damping down in that the religions of the last 4,000 years the axial age they reflected an intensification of our getting access to spiritual reality yoga meditation uh we were just getting deeper and deeper first takes in the spiritual reality and if you do have a deep experience of spiritual reality how could you not but think we belong there more than here somehow there's been an accident that we got marooned here the job is to get back to there right Christ will come and save me from my sins I am stuck in the mud get me back to there I'll become enlightened I'll become awakened so when I can awake I can go there because who wants to be here when you can go there okay I understand that I feel the compassion in that but now that we're beginning to understand how big here is how huge it is how old it is that we measure it in light years and in in distances of six million million miles a year in one light year and we're measuring billions of light years across and it's so old it doesn't really make sense to really say oh yeah and after all of this evolutionary thrust just after 5,000 years when we began to be conscious just as we begin to sink down into that consciousness which we share with all of life and we discover oh my God my life is one with all of life just then we leave the system and the system has served its purpose no I don't think so at least what came through in my work and I find so many people affirming it and that is uh it is about incarnating deeper and deeper and deeper not just patching up our history but incarnating the power of Spirit incarnating Heaven into our physical bodies Heaven into our social relationships it's about giving birth to this deeper Consciousness inside our incarnations I think we're giving birth so that the ego beautiful thing as it is the Consciousness that holds our lifetime is giving birth to the soul Consciousness in the body the diamond Soul the whole the Consciousness that holds all of our our lifetimes not as fragments but unified as one fused in one when all of our lifetimes all those thousands of years come together and fuse into a singularity it gives birth to a Consciousness that is more than just an enlightened Consciousness it gives birth to a magnitude of Consciousness which is different it's a 100,000 year old Consciousness and that is becoming the new operational consciousness of humanity to get there we have to let go of all the divisions that we've invoked all the racism all the political divisions all the national divisions all the class divisions all that stuff which we've kept used to keep separate from each other this has got to we got to sweat that stuff out of our out of our pors we have to sweat it out and I don't know how long it's going to take I don't know how many Generations but is it is a multigenerational task isn't it it's a multigenerational task where somewhere along the way we go through gradually probably a transformation where we do something like the mystics do we go through a death and rebirth we go through a complete collapse a surrender to forces beyond our control we let go of self-interest we begin to take on into our hearts the needs of other beings in this crisis where we will all become refugees at one way or another the human heart I think is going to be opened purified touched and the human heart that emerges from this time in history is going to be massive beautiful ecstatic enlightened prophetic cist Consciousness Buddha Consciousness Prophet Consciousness different order of time and I think all of us knew what we were getting into when we chose to Incarnate in this part of the century we chose to be part of it we chose to align ourselves with his ccal movement not just for our own benefit it speeds up our Evolution but it also helps our children helps our grandchildren through this We're All in This Together so I think karma is part of the web work but here's another thing those when we are privileged to touch the infinite the infinite is like Ali Ali income free infinite is like infinite Joy no judgment infinite capacity to transform Karma and wrap it up and throw it away so there's on the one hand we learn we have to learn on the other hand we can learn and let go much faster than we think we can we let go these old stupid narrow concepts of God which keep us so imprisoned in our fear and uncertainty let that go I think this is an extraordinary powerful time and I do think you're right yeah I'll tell you Robert Monroe his book Monro is the Monroe Institute his book for Journeys he was taken into the future he thinks somewhere around mid 3000 something ad and in that future when he looked up and saw the BAU there was no BAU anymore there were no souls in the intermediate state it was physical reality purely open into the Luminosity of diamond light and I think what that it teaches us is that the BAU are lives that are unresolved unfinished uh and it's individual but also Collective I think we are processing our former lives we're processing our Karma we're growing up we're facing ourselves in history and when that happens we will be much more transparent to the Divine intelligence to the Divine love to the Define information that can help us when we have this kind of access there'll be no technical problem that we can't solve there'll be no social problem that we can't heal can't solve right that's what I think we're working towards So yeah thank you thanks for the great question Christopher yeah beautiful answer um so Janine you're the next questioner thank you ah thank you so much Chris um let's see I guess maybe if I put it on gallery then I won't feel strange [Laughter] um yeah thank you so much I I I actually like I have so much in my thoughts right now um that I'm going to try to connect to them one is um I said to a friend who used to not have like spiritual expansive connections and then her husband died and then you know she had experience and um she had sort of judged me before from my experiences and um what popped out of my mouth is one person's experience is another person's woo woo yeah yeah you know and so um uh I think that's important to me because I find myself like not wanting to prove anything to anybody just because I come from a different world right um but simply to experience and um share when that feels appropriate and wow that last response one of the things that reminded me of was having a soul retrieval at a time that I was like at the lowest time in my life and just completely overwhelmed really having a hard time functioning and in the two-day process I went from being in that state to so expansive so joyful so so much ease and so when you're talking about where we're going you know I I'm like I'm not going to assume that we know how it's going to go and it it may be very different for different people um but things can happen really fast yeah so Janine do you have a question um yeah I guess I guess I was saying these things to hear responses to them but um one question yeah go ahead is I think you're very much right soul retrieval and what's happening in an historical situation is very similar in Soul retrieval we retrieve alienated split off portions of our soul and to do that we have to heal Those portions and integrate them welcome them back into the unity I think the same thing is happening uh in our historical process too we are retrieving our souls during the whole period of history when we thought we were Egos and we made decisions based on our private separate existence now we have to retrieve all those pieces of injured and what we did to other people so that we can now grow into a a full manifest Soul yeah other quick question and thank you so much I appreciate that um I I'm curious whether you've um looked at the work of nim harine the unified field physicist because I think there's some alignment you know different worlds yet some real connections sounds like it doesn't it I mean unified theory I'm up for all up for unified theory but here's the one of the advantages of being retired getting old is I don't have to keep up with the literature anymore so IIT I'm really behind on you know the literature as such but the you know uran lal's work akashic feeli field Theory Chaos Theory uh the work in fields uh yeah absolutely yeah fertile ground great thank you so much for all that you're sharing with us appreciate it thank you thank you Janine oops Norma you're you're up next what's your question I I'm I don't exactly have a question uh but I'm uh I I have been studying myself getting old and um I I'm going through a process and I'm losing my identity I'm not who I was Each decade I'm a different person and now I'm losing my identity and I realize I've I've been an ego and my ego was all that identity and now and also what you said oh then I said where where do people I think I'm headed maybe toward people lessness people and I'm wondering oh maybe this is a question yeah uh because what I saw when you were describing the golden something is dust is dust and the possibility that humans as that I will not be human but I will be dust dust to dust and dust to dust or whatever it is so that is kind of bringing that and I do appreciate uh dropping in and getting excited about more information so I'll go to the library and find you well you know Nora your experience of getting lighter and lighter and kind of Disappearing that that speaks to me that's my experience too I find that the older I get and I'm 75 now so you may have a couple years on me but I'm right behind you uh the thinner my arms get and the weaker my skeleton gets it's like it's falling off it gets soft and it's falling off and as it falls off the memories associated with get loose and they can fall off and I find it much easier to move into egoless places than I used to just because my my skin is wrapped a little loose you know in my mind and I think we get older it gets easier to step into that in between Place uh and that's that's that's just kind of and it just when when we get to the very end it's a big release and we go light to light light that's that's what I'm feeling too is I'm getting lighter you know everything is getting lighter and I'm excited about the last breath I'm hoping I can be conscious with my last breath you know all my life I've been telling my children when they're every little little bit kids I said it's a great life and in the end you get to die death is something to look forward to death is graduation death is coming home if there if there were one thing I wish I could give to people it's give up your fear of death if you have a fear of death you've got your entire metaphysics upside down birth is when the hard stuff begins you should mourn the child they're beginning first grade death is graduation death is joy and cele ation all of our mythology that makes death hard difficult ghosty nonsense 99.9% of the people it's a spontaneous into the arms of the Divine rushing home and so if you're clear I mean if you're really clear on what birth is and what death is then death is something you take into your heart and celebrate this is a life coming to fruition you're bringing your soul and everything you've learned back to your core Soul you're bringing all of your decisions back to your core soul and that's that's like wow that's graduation it may not be joy and sorrow it may not be joy and sorrow it may be something whole yeah bigger than that bigger than joy and S whole yeah yeah yeah thank you you bet yeah thank you thank you Norma um I guess it's my turn because Paul here has a question um my question was um from as you've talked about and you've talked about the word reincarnation is reincarnation from your perspective strictly related to humanity on Earth or does it uh serve um a a different role or a greater role in the broader Universe yeah yeah good question and you know in my writing you know that my work really focuses on human consciousness and people have asked me how come you don't get really deep into animal Consciousness and plant Consciousness like a lot of other shamans and whatnot and that's a really good question because I know there are feels of Consciousness related to plant kingdoms and animal kingdoms and I think the reason is because for me Humanity represents the greatest threat to all life on the planet and so my work has been really trying to work with human consciousness in the belief that if we can heal Humanity all the other forms of life will be safer will be safe from us interesting the cultures that believe in reincarnation they all tend to agree on one thing it doesn't begin with human beings so they all look to higher mamalian forms higher life forms among the animal kingdoms as a bridge over into uh human consciousness so there is a sense of learning the basics so my sense of it is individuality is the seed kernel that makes reincarnation possible so I don't look at a field of grass and say hm this a 10,000 individuals there they all pretty much it's a collective identity somewhere along the way these complex Collective identities give birth to more and more individual awareness self-awareness in it my dog I tend to think that my dog's pretty individuated you know so somewhere along the way reincarnation begins as a learning a following a learning and following and it begins before human beings I think but nobody knows exactly where and nobody knows exactly how but it's just an organic natural developmental process from humans and I also think once you come to certain thresholds there's not much point in incarnating at a lower level general rule of thumb once you can function as a human being not much point in functioning coming back as a dog because that you're at a Quantum jump higher now that's I don't want to make it make rigid rules here but basically it's kind of like college once you get can do uh uh once you can do calculus we will not give you a course to go back and take a course in algebra because algebra assume calculus assumes a knowledge of algebra you can do it if you want but we won't give you credit for it I think it's like that with you know with Incarnation we sort of go through certain developmental stages and once you can function at that stage then naturally you want to function at that stage and higher that stage and higher yeah thank you thank you I have one more question related to that is of all the books I've read on on reincarnation in past lives I've not seen one where there was a reincarnation from or to another planet or star system do you have anything to say about that well I'd say why not I mean like once you understand that the the dynamic principles of evolution are being are carrying themselves out playing themselves out another Sol systems in other galaxies and you run the numbers it's kind of like there's got to be there's got to be intelligent life out there and if we can incarnate then they can incarnate and distance is a material and there are some people who have conscious recall of having been a a life form in another planet and I can't remember her name but there's a woman who does past life therapy and this is her major Focus helping people who integrate incarnations that which are aware from another lifetime so if you do a little digging around and I'm sorry I just can't remember her name at present uh so I just say sure why not I I personally don't have conscious recall of such though I will say I was at a a uh spiritual Workshop uh met a person there one of the teachers there and he had recall of he and I and one other person there in in another planetary system in another Incarnation so I'd say okay why not why not great so we have time for one last question if anyone unless you would like to say have a a last say Chris well let me just maybe draw draw some things together and let's great uh clearly reincarnation is not doesn't end all your all the questions to me reincarnation just begins a whole Rich vein of questions it opens up possibilities because it it relieves us from the terrible burden of time now when we ask ourselves what do we want to be what do we want to become we should be thinking in terms of 10,000 year increments not hundred-year increments do you want to become Beethoven do you want to become you know a Mozart do you want to become a great poet a great artist now we have unlimited time the universe wants us to develop all the talents that are latent within this human form so and the diamond soul is going to function at a much much higher level of sensory experience Vision much more refined intense clarified all the physical senses it's not just an open heart it's not just an open mind but the entire physical body animated into higher orders of self-realization the Divine is shoving together kind of I think of it as green reality Earth and then light pure light spiritual reality and we're just foring more and more and more and more into each other until we become Green Spiritual Beings filled with light radiating with light it's going to take time but the pace is picking up and uh and I think when the child is born when we re re succeed in bringing this new awakened Consciousness transformed Consciousness into the world like every mother and every mother they will look at that child and we will say it was worth it it was worth it to give birth to This Magnificent being this Christ child this Buddha awakened child to humanity not just here and there not just for some special people here and there for all of humanity everywhere and boy don't you know the women have to I think women are the key to getting us through this crisis men have had their chance we have screwed it up we've had our chance women have to exercise a greater and greater share of power to reclaim the power that they've been denied to bring it fully forward and Any Man worth his salt will be so glad when that happens because we'll know that half of us is now showing up fully and we are stronger when we're all together yeah and that's basically the message of reincarnation we are constantly growing deeper Community not just deeper individuals we're growing deeper Community we have Blended all the races in our body we've Blended all the different cultures all the different religions in our body they're all here we are the living Consciousness that incorporates the future human which is transnational transracial trans religious we're just there's so many false identities which are going to fall away quickly as we make this and as we make this transition here's one of the sweet things my last thought to share with you we're going to find that 99% of the work has already been done we are just waking up the fedus isn't gated in the day of Labor Labor's been long most most of the work has already been done it's just the last bit the last waking up the last time around opening up and letting this birth take place I think it's this is the century it'll happen this Century it has to we don't have time we do not have time yeah thank you very much for giving us such a big slice of your day and and having this time for us to spend together really it's such wonderful experience to know and I hope that you take the work and take it out among your friends and U share the book share the work it's a real honor thank you thank you Chris that was that was fabulous I'm gonna put it on gallery view and if you want to unmute yourself and say goodbye to Chris and everyone else thank you all for coming this has been fabulous um wonderful thank you thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much thank you Chris and thank you D have a beautiful rest of your day CHR I have one question can you say your last name thank Youk you</p></body></html>

was that was that the title yes that was a publisher title but my title while I was writing the book was always diamonds from Heaven okay beautiful absolutely I've been a fan of your books actually Colin and I uh talk about you regularly about your books I've been a fan I reincarnation was wonderful and then the one in the middle and then then the LSD uh books been fabulous so thank you a lot of the people here do not know your research methods so kind of what I would um describe you as kind of is an Explorer of the outer reaches of the cosmos really kind of in search of the truth of reality and um really what it means to be kind of human uh in in in this reality and um your research method is is deeply interesting and I would love if we you could start us off by telling us about about what that is and and what your work has been well what we all share in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with Consciousness it's fused with mind and soul uh and of course now we know how vast the the physical universe is and the question becomes how large is the mind of the universe how deep is it and so I was just out of graduate school in 1978 and I finished in philosophy of religion and I met the work of stanislav Gro who many of you know uh one of the foremost thinkers in the transpersonal psychology community in the Psychedelic community and I read his book Realms of the human unconscious and my life pivoted with that book because I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to Clinical Psychology but also to philosophy that it would he was offering a method to actually safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness wherein lay the answers to the philosophical questions that I was carrying coming out of a training in religious studies so in 1979 I began what became a 20-year Journey working with LSD and it was 19 79 LSD is what Stan had done his research with and it's what I chose to continue with if I were doing it today I would have a more Diversified cocktail of aasa soide been more but I worked with LSD and I chose to work with very high doses for reasons that are too complicated to go into now but that had a profound impact on the work because it not only changed How Deep The went work the work went but it changed how wide it it went uh the field of Consciousness that I took in these transformational exercises expanded with the power of the State of Consciousness that I was entering to enter into these exercises uh so basically I did this work in standard Pro graian protocol totally isolated from the world with the sitter a trained clinical psychologist sitter uh um I did it at home in a controlled environment totally internally focused not any with any contact of the outside world amplifying the states of awareness with carefully selected music designed to empower the states of Consciousness in which you basically just shatter your mind you in in essentially working at these levels you just shatter your mind and your mind dissolves out into subtler and subtler forms are aspects of reality uh and it became a systematic exploration of what I think of as the mind of the Universe I hesitate to call it the Divine though sometimes I do it's just because the Divine has so many culturally infused uh qualities in history that I'd rather avoid um so I think of it as the mind of the universe uh and I did this work for 20 years uh always keeping very careful records and whatnot and and then I I digested those experiences for another 20 years because this is these are not immediately transparent experiences they're very complex and interwoven and they involve many levels of reality being orchestrated in the same kind of title surges of these states and there was a systematic instruction I found that one session more or less started where the other session stopped when you work in this systematic fashion there was a progressive deepening and deepening and deepening and so it it just took years for me to understand what the universe was showing me and where it was taking me and I was being shown things I mean I always had a sense of a systematic encounter with an intelligence that was orchestrating my experience in dialogue with me uh not taking any form never taking any any deity form or any archetypal form but always when pressed dissolving into deeper and deeper layers of Infinity uh anyway so that is cumulatively the story that I'm telling in LSD in the mind of the universe and would you say Chris that this is an objective reality that if anybody that did a similar method I mean I think I think what you did was incredibly brave but would would everybody kind of Reach This unfolding that you did uh using that method or is that not possible to say no I think I think it is possible to say I think Stan gr's work allows us to say it uh and where he's dealing with integrating the experiences of thousands of people and I'm only talking integrating my experiences but my experiences fit comfortably within the larger Matrix that gr's uh work has explored and it's a complicated answer because on the one hand I want to say yes and the other hand I have to qualify that immediately because when you begin this work these substances only amplify Consciousness they don't give you an experience they don't take you a particular place they amplify your mind and because each of us has a different life story then the mind which is Amplified is different and we therefore when an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe what comes forward will be in the beginning somewhat unique and will reflect our individual history and that's why these substances are very helpful for healing uh they they evoke our unconscious and therefore they evoke our problems and it's an individual experience but if you keep going farther if you press to the limits of of your time space identity if you press to the limits of what your individual history can hold and go through this transformation we call ego death then you begin to open into spiritual reality farther removed from your own personal history and that's when the experiences begin to overlap that's when they begin to uh converge now my understanding is that spiritual reality is not simply something you enter and pluck fruit from like plucking an apple from a tree it's interactive it's always interactive so there's a participatory equality to our experiences so the mind that we bring to the encounter acts as a seed Catalyst that crystallizes a certain set of experiences from the infinite potential of the mind of the universe and then as we internalize those experiences and are purified by those experiences it changes the seed mind and then we it catalyzes an even deeper level of Secrets From the universe so it's a both and situation participatory but once you understand the the cycle of participation then I think the universe that we discover is coherent and consistent my universe is the same universe that is discovered by uh contemplative monks the mystical Traditions the near-death episode Traditions there are degrees of depth and that we have to be careful because um you can reach a point where you think oh this is what the reality is and it turns out well no this is what reality is at this level of reality but you can pop that and go into a deeper level of reality and things change a bit one thing that I find really exciting about your work is that we talk about practices you know that finding the right practices to find the cracks kind of in ourselves to get back to a much porous expanded way way of being and yet these practices take repetition and tenaciousness and everything and and you have used a different method here you've you've used what what one might kind of think of as a fast track to some of these experiences I mean it's a very difficult method and I'm sure not one that you would kind of recommend to a lot of people but that that feels for me where the excitement of your work is as you fast tracked a lot of slower practices and possibly got to the edge of the map that a lot of these contemplative practices have got to um I feel as though you've managed to go further than than much that I've seen before on kind of what what the underlying nature of reality is would you say that's true it is a fast track except uh it's a fast track that doesn't allow any bypass so the fact that it's a fast track means it's a much more intensely uh concentrated track so purification which in a conventional spiritual path would be drawn out over years can take place within days and as any woman who's given birth knows a short labor is not necessarily an easier labor it it's just much much more intense and this is true for this type of practice true the purifications that one goes through in order to acclimate to these subtler and cleaner and clearer states of reality those purifications and detoxifications are extremely intense I mean they they send you in convulsions across the floor in throwing up constantly coming and going uh and they require uh a systematic purification of your lifestyle just as any traditional spiritual practice does and I want to emphasize that the states of Consciousness that I touched for hours at a time we usually only learn about these realities from the work of contemplative Mystics who have a certain sense that they abide in these realities and I emphasize that this is a practice not of abiding it's a it's a temporary access it's only temporary immersion in these states and I don't want to confuse temporary immersion from abiding immersion all honor to the great ones who abide in these realities you know this is different this is temporary access very very intense purification but you don't come away with permanent access embedded in your nature to these realities What You Come Away with are seeds of transcendence or seed experiences which you then have to nurture within your your daily spiritual practice you have to nurture them within your embodied physical existence and I also want to mention that these practices in the earlier times in history have tended to be associated with a dissociative spirituality so the goal was to get up into Transcendence and get away from Earth you know so these are the up andout cosmologies of the last five exal age religions the last 5,000 years the cosmology that emerged in my work is very different it wasn't about getting Transcendence it was Transcendence in service of incarnation Transcendence and service of deeper integration it was about opening up and letting in as much of the universe as possible and then going through the Transformations that would allow this energy to live in the historical body and giving me at one point insights into where the evolutionary intellig was taking the Human family as a whole I began this work thinking in terms of a personal model of transformation but things happened that just shattered that model and I began to understand that I was had been drawn into a collective transformation and that my my so-called individual work was part of a collective process which then naturally lead yielded some insights into our Collective family family Human family evolutionary trajectory fantastic and I want to ask you about that in great depth in a minute because for me that's kind of the exciting um thing that you discovered if you like but first of all I'd love to ask you about the aliveness and intelligence in the universe then um we are talking about um the aliveness and intelligence in everything around us you know in humans being just one node of that but just kind of as is everything um an animate World an animate Universe I just wondered if you could summarize your um understandings of the aliveness in the universe and and how layered that is and how deep that goes how big it is um yes what did you what have you gleaned well you're asking a lot because it you know the universe is so vast and the mind of the universe has so many layers to it and those layers are of course all complexly interwoven and it's all alive and it's all intelligent and it's it's everywhere we dig into the universe of course we discover aliveness and intelligence we we're finding that we can't dig in anywhere and not encounter this intelligence this living intelligence uh so when you dig into the mind of the universe you find layers of intelligence operating there there are layers of int of intelligence operating in the biosphere operating in the incarnational uh rhythms of a planet and I began to experience at one point for example reincarnation the I had gone into I'm sorry to cut so many corners here but there's no way to do it except jump into it go into States Of Consciousness in which time was radically dilated not eternity not timelessness but radical dilations of time and dilations of of of personal boundaries so dissolving into my human family becoming the Human family and from that perspective experiencing reincarnation the pulse of reincarnation taking place all of us together as a single organism incarnating Generation by generation and I experienced whole lifetimes incarnating in Generations living their lives dying and returning into the spiritual reality and there was an intelligence to this entire process so that all of our what I had previously thought of as individual Karma individual challenging individual transformation all of our individual Karma was part of a a vast network of exquisitly tuned Collective Karma and our and history was expressing The rhythms of collective transformation through the medium of our individual transformation just one example and then going deeper beginning to experience the the pulse of the entire universe as a single living organism and when you when you dissolve at into that level of Oneness you know the Buddhists have a word for they talk about Nirvana uh blown out self is blown out or shunyata emptiness of self when you experience the world as one in any scale then you experience that there are no permanent boundaries between yourself and the world so literally there is no private self and so the self kind of pops and life runs through you you run through life and the whole of Life breathes as one it breathes together uh as platinus said so everywhere you touch it the world is intelligent at the very end of my journey after in the 70th session out of 73 I did 73 sessions in the 70th session I was taken deep deep deep into what I call Deep time farther into time than I had ever been taken before and given a series of visions and one of those Visions had to do with experiencing in some way from my perspective and my history the large story of what was happening in the universe and I experienced reincarnation I was experiencing the same deep pattern and I experience stars of light shooting out of time and space shoot shoting into the universe and I I understood that these were what I call Diamond Souls these were the fruition of a reincarnation process creating a a diamond pure soul that could explore the spiritual World in Dimensions previously unavailable to it that time and space was creating Diamond Souls over vast periods of time so so layers and layers and layers of intelligence operating at different levels so when I read your book Chris I mean it's literally mindblowing I mean it it's kind of it feels as though it's science fiction or it's in the Realms of Science Fiction and yet for me there was nothing in there that didn't sound right you know it just kind of has that feeling of ah yes I understand this and it feels right to to me um and I'd love to talk to you about the evolutionary process you touched on it a bit there but let's go into that in more detail but first of all reincarnation because that is something that obviously we don't all um feel is true but it you you did earlier work on the subject of reincarnation and just before we go on to the evolutionary um story that you've seen could you talk about a little bit about reincarnation and your work on it and why you believe that that is what's happening well I did I wrote my first book on reincarnation because I thought it was such an essential principle because the our philosophical roads divide if you think we only are on earth one time or we're on Earth multiple times those lead to different visions of reality and today I think we have overwhelming empirical evidence that reincarnation is simply true it's a fact of life I think Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia and his study of young children around the world who have spontaneous memories of their most immediate life he's just documented hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these children uh and his his research has been challenged but it's still it's holding up and I think he is the Charles Darwin of reincarnation studies and then we have past life therapies uh people coming in highly qualified people healing using past life access to past life memories to heal present life traumas that this to me it's just an empirical fact of life so after living it takes a long time to S of live in a reincarnation Universe to understand the implications of the the fact that there's this pulse of life and that all of us have been here multiple times and all of us have deeper histories with place with people with projects and that we're always starting something and we're continuing something in one Lifetime and we're doing something that's going to be continued in another lifetime that that this overlapping complexity so that I don't see little children as little anymore and I don't see old people as old anymore sometimes little children are deeply old in Soul and old people are sometimes very young in Soul and so it's you you just tuned to a different level now I had that in the early stages of my psychedelic work and in the early stages of my psychedelic work I was taken into some of the nuts and bolts of reincarnation in karma and then that became kind of ground one uh as I began to be taken into the Human family and to experience the Human family evolving and growing through reincarnation this to me reincarnation is simply the uh higher Octave of evolution it's The Cutting Edge of evolution in our particular species where Evolution CH was trying to change whole species reincarnation is evolving individuals within certain species and I don't think just human species I think somewhere lower down the line reincarnation begins to turn in Gate uh and then the question becomes well where is reincarnation taking us if we are reincarnating so many times where are we going what's go what's the whole project of it what's the purpose of it and to determine to answer the question what's the purpose of a reincarnating species is complicated because once you understand that every human being on the planet is reincarnating with a purpose its specific purpose then you realize the full breath of the living experience of of human being the breath of what's being learned that what humanity is learning is just enormous and when we try to say well this is the purpose of life we have a tendency to sort of take a purpose that we can identify with and maybe overgeneralize it to Encompass all purposes so we really have to look at the whole of the Human family and just State the whole of the things that people are learning to even begin to come up with some generality that encompasses them all you see what I mean so so in some cases uh we can be learning love we can be learning generosity we can be learning strength of self we can be learning uh physical defense we can be learning surrendering physical defense what one person is growing into in one lifetime another person may be growing out out of and both of them are living their Truth at a process level most of the Eastern religions basically say yes you grow you activate the chakras you bring higher and higher levels of consciousness online but when your Consciousness opens up to Divine Essence when it opens up to the the you that is more real than any of your individual private incarnational 's the Divine you the ESS you when you open up to that then you reached Enlightenment what the Hindus call Moka means you can excape you can leave so once you wake up then let's get out of here there's better places to be than Earth so it's an up and out cosmology but what happened in my uh sessions was different than that uh I reached a point about halfway on my journey when all of my former lives began to come into me I was in a a again a kind of a pregnant time reality of deep time and my fmer lives were coming in and we coming in it was like wrapping a a filament of kite string around a spool but that string was Human Experience it was whole human lifetimes and they kept coming together and they reached a critical mass and when they reached a critical mass they fused into one and when that happened there was a tremendous explosion of energy and a diamond Luminosity exploded from my chest and that's when I began to understand and was shown that we make progress incrementally Life Time by left time as we incarnate but the goal is not simply to make incremental progress the goal eventually is that all of our Lives come infused into one and we become come on earth a being who has aund thousand hundreds of thousands of years of history in it awakened within it and empowered within it that is the being that we are becoming and that is a different kind of being than an egoic being it's the vast depth of its heart is deep is bigger the breath of its mind is bigger the texture of its social relationships is bigger and its relationship to Nature is different because it knows that the world we leave is the world we inherit it has a deeper embodied texture of its relationship with nature and my Discovery was that this is not simply a path of individuals this is simply a story of individual Spiritual Awakening that we are all going through this transition we are all giving birth to the D Diamond Soul the entire species is at a point in its history where it can no longer afford the luxury of trying to live on this planet in the fragmented egoic State when the world order is created by egos it leads to a fragmented order that serves some and not others but when the soul wakes up to the with the profound compassion of its history the soul lives on this planet different ly than the ego does and I think we are coming into a very profound uh tumultuous period of History which I think of as a birth process it will feel like a death process and it is a death process it's basically destroying the culture that was built by the ego and destroying the ego which built that culture and in that process of dying to that which is small giving birth to something new giving birth literally to a new stage in the human story not a a new body politic and new economics and a and a a a shift I think is taking place at the depths of the collective unconscious the plate tectonics of the collective psyche are shifting in that yian sense deep deep down inside the human psyche this transformation is taking place so that all human beings who are born after this transition will be living their individual life within the Matrix of a different Collective psyche that I think is the work of the hour that's what we are working to and part of this to actualize and part of this is Reawakening to the divine presence which we've stripped out of nature tried to unsuccessfully but reaw Awakening to this common ground that we have with nature to this intelligence that surrounds us and saturates US wow Chris I mean I'm imagining that people hearing this for the first time it's kind of difficult to get your head around it and I'm want to BR I want to bring Colin in in a minute so to summarize in my kind of uh terms then what you're talking about really is is the evolution of the human species individuals and collectively towards a POS where we can remember our entire history so if we take reincarnation as a given then we're evolving towards a a place where we can remember past our past incarnations on this Earth and you know I Co Colin can I bring you in here because there's something that you uh talk about you know in reanimating ourselves we need to have a completely new cognitive framework you know the the that the the the way of connecting to the intelligence in the universe is so foreign to us now that we need a whole different framework to kind of be able to wrestle with with that kind of information what's your feeling about what Chris is talking about I know you've read the book too and I know you love it so bi biased question here but yeah from your perspective thanks Rachel uh well first of all I I really wanted to say how much of an honor it is to meet you Chris um I I I have to say you know the encounter with your books and the first one I encountered was dark knight early Dawn was was really um well tectonic in nature for me it was um and I'm filled with questions and was and have been all the way through uh reading your books and rereading them reading them again and thinking about it and Brewing on it and and a lot of the the questions I really want to ask I I I have no idea how I would even articulate I can feel them and I can sense them but how um and you know so I mean I can see feel myself at the sort of edges you know of my what I call my present cognition because you know I was um I was lucky enough to be um born into and brought up within a traditional indigenous culture here in southern Africa um and through through my childhood lived in Wilderness and among people who had a very very particular relationship with Wilderness and a cosmology that came out of that yeah uh and subsequently I find myself you know in um in in in the worlds of of uh um post post-industrial world trying to reconcile that part of me with the part of me I find myself in now um and and finding that that there's it's very difficult to bring it feels like in a certain sense that there are two cognitive Frameworks within me at some level and that somehow I'm tasked with trying to reconcile these two parts of myself um and reading reading through your books I you know where I found I found myself pulled back into uh the cognitive system really that I I grew up in and that forms a kind of an underst structure within my experience now um and but I mean within that then I have I have questions I mean loads of them which which your books really really brought up in me and and and among them among the most um difficult to articulate or questions around time uh and and the notion that some how or rather you know so reincarnation is not something that really comes into the cosmologies here in southern Africa and yet it does it's it's implicit in certain terms um but I'm really uh um so so as we look at this idea of reincarnation uh and the cognitive framework that I would perceive it from here as we speak about it relies on a sequence of time that speaks of a past from which we come and a future to which we go uh but what happens if we take that out if in fact if in fact that's merely my present cognitive framework but you know how would we understand uh reincarnation and the notion of a trajectory towards something if time in its kind of sequence from beginning to seeming culmination or some such thing if that wasn't the case um yeah I don't know if I'm making any sense in what I making sense it's a good question if you uh if we eliminate the arrow of time then reincarnation begins to look like multi Incarnation not reincarnation some people have conceptualized this we're living all of our Lives simultaneously in a and and that we're interacting all these lives are active and interacting in a way that befuddles the logic of line development and it requires a different kind of logic and I've tried to think in that world uh multiple times and I basically keep coming down to I can't do it I mean I literally cannot live in a world where multi- Incarnation makes sense I can't make it make sense uh now another little thread Robert Monroe from the Monroe Institute of Applied science outof body guy you know has been wrote three wonderful books on the outof body State exploring the universe daily from the outof body State he says you reach a point in your Spiritual Development where you discover that you can incarnate in any time period you wish so Soul forward does not mean time forward right so you can incarnate in the 10th Century BC and next you could incarnate in the 20th century ad so permeability of time do you see how that continues the concept of linear development but it it flexes on the concept of times's absolute linearity for myself I've gone through so many permutations of time um moving into deep time where you can ex I I I experienced my entire life in the early stages birth to death simultaneously present absolutely I was experiencing the whole whole of my life the end and the beginning and all of its development as a simultaneous whole later I was taken into periods of time where a 100,000 years were being lived out as if it were one minute uh it's convinced me that the Universe has many modalities of time built into it that when we move into deeper dimensionals of reality there are different modalities of time that are available there all that would you would think and it does make me receptive to the idea of letting go of a concept of linear time and linear development and somehow I try to reconcile the fact that from the universe's perspective there are multiple modalities of time so that the Universe can show me the future from its time which is and can give me me the experience of knowing the future as something which has already happened and simultaneously which is yet to happen and at the same time at the same time hold on to some notion of the value and the challenge of something approximating linear development uh and I think my best take is that life chops its its challenges to as it chops the learning into bits and pieces and we can't learn it all in one lifetime we can't do it all simultaneously it's easier if it's just broken down into bits and pieces uh and if this if this challenge of linear development is coming to a fruition and is coming to a diamond Soul a a an awareness that holds all of its time moments in its present Consciousness on Earth this this of course is not the end of the developmental story of the linear story because in a million years will'll be far in a billion years will be farther still the universe is just getting warmed up you know is that we have no reason for thinking that the universe is is anywhere near the end of its evolutionary story we know it's really at the early stages of its story so I think of time as one of the great gifts of evolution individuality is one of the great gifts of the physical Universe time is one of the gifts of the physical Universe behind that lay lies permutations of metaphysics that that are more fluid with respect to time but inside Space time I think there is a an approximate linear Arrow of time which serves the Soul's purpose purp which serve some deeper Cosmic web and yet at the same time when we are in the the linear development if we open up to the universe if we open up to the universe's sense of time we often get these flashes of more than more than the present you know more parallel dimensions of time so your question makes a lot of sense and it's it's a substantive question can I ask one Colin or do you want to come back on that okay so yeah great this is the problem with your work Chris we need to keep trying to we we're we're out in kind of like um inarticulable uh terrain aren't we um when we get to that what you call the Diamond Soul then when there's this moment of um remembering what what are the other attributes what are the other kind of what does that bring other than remembering and wholeness you know did you you have an experience of what else well first of all I think Soul Consciousness is what we return to when we die so while we're in the Bardo Earth Bardo Earth kind of stage when we die we return to whole Consciousness so it's not something we're unfamiliar with it's something we are familiar with and then we precipitate out of whole Consciousness into part Consciousness egoic Consciousness and we return so it's a it's a constant accordion kind of effect we die as we get large we're born we get small we die we get large we're born we get small sooner or later if we just keep up for a few thousand years years 100 million years sooner or later large wakes up inside physical Consciousness and so it's a it's simply uh a consolidation of what's taking place naturally and normally it's just a stage in this process the times that I've been carried into deep time and experience temporarily my diamond soul and then the diamond sto the soul that's emerging as an archetypal imprint an archetypal form it's hard to describe because of the uh enormity and the beauty and the joy we're we're looking we're talking about a human being that's completely healed of all the wounds of History that's healed of all the terrible things we've done to each other men and women and wars and violence it's healed all of those scars healed a a tremendous breath of communion with the natural world an intimacy with all life forms not only then a breath of companionship with all life and with other human beings and with human community and with natur Nature's Community but an openness of the Mind able to take in more directly enter into deeper communion with the intelligence of the Universe I mean the genius of the universe has all the answers to all the technological limited questions we we we want to have answers to and we just are not able to download all that knowledge and the diamond soul is a a more U complete and higher potency of human being that can enter into deeper downloads from the Divine intelligence but it's not only an expansion of heart and an expansion of Mind our physical senses are also Amplified by or ERS of magnitude in the very very last session after 73 sessions the very last session the universe gave me an experience of what I call Diamond Vision suddenly in a kind of a late late session wind down clear space my vision became thousands of times more cute and sharper than it had ever been before I could see things details gradients of color sharpness and precision of form I could just see I I was amazed that I ever had accepted this fuzzy stuff as real seeing this was diamond clarity seeing and then after 10 minutes it went away and I was seeing the way I normally see and that's when I discovered I realized what I was being shown is that we tend to think of sensation as kind of a biomechanical process but it's actually a conscious process and the more Consciousness which ISE is present in this body this body has built into it the capacity for infinitely higher levels of Sensi experience touch hearing seeing sensitivities of of of all manner of physical Sensations so it truly is it's heaven on Earth in the body so that the body participates in the qualities of heaven without having to leave the physical existence this is why I mean it's not an up andout cosmology it's bringing it in deeper and deeper and deeper changing literally the physiology of the body to allow it to operate in this ecstatic state which becomes the normal State yeah that as a child I think is is worth the labor that we're going into to give birth to and we are going in a terribly terribly severe labor our past is being Stripped Away will be stripped away we will lose all capacities that we associate with normal and minimal existence this is what happens in all mystical traditions in all psychedelic Traditions literally the small has to be broken ground to dust stripped and dismembered in order for the new to awaken within us and this is happening now historically where we're entering into what I think of as the dark night of our Collective Soul The Dark Knight is an image often used for a hard time but it's not a hard time in John of the Cross The Dark Knight of self is a hard time The Dark Night of the soul is a very very intense purification time which immediately precedes The Awakening of full illumination and a dark night of the of the Collective Soul is a time of intense purification intense loss of reality as we have known it up to this point in time and I think out of the out of the pain and suffering that's coming it's going to crack US Open and and break us down to our Center and in this ordeal we will not survive but we will give birth to that in us which is more beautiful more ecstatic more competent more plugged in uh I think we truly are becoming a species of Buddhas a species of christs and prophets these are the models we've had trying to give us some for vision of what's happening in the early years we could not imagine it an ordinary human being reaching that level of Excellence but now we're beginning to understand through reincarnation over and over and over and over again slowly we grow into that level of Excellence which is simply a level of transparency to the essential condition which in which we experience life the irony is we experience what's always been happening all the way along it's always been this way the universe has always been one the universe has always been filled with intelligence we have always been empty of self but somehow we distracted ourselves for thinking that that's not there it's always been there so we're waking up to the Paradise that the Universe already is we've just been missing it wow Chris I I just find your experience and your vision just such a hopeful one as we move into what we see as ecological crisis and societal crisis and I I just again as I feel quite emotional said at the beginning it was just one of the most inspiring books or the most inspiring book last year but what what one of the most of my lifetime you know I and I'm sure Colin would agree with me on that so it's so wonderful to hear</p></body></html>

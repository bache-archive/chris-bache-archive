00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.600
Welcome, Chris. It's a great joy to have&nbsp;
you with me on New Thinking Allowed today.&nbsp;

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.320
Thank you, Amy. It's a pleasure to be here. Today,&nbsp;
we're going to discuss your deep exploration&nbsp;

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:21.920
of yourself, your own spiritual journey and into&nbsp;
the cosmic mind. When you had 73 LSD sessions&nbsp;

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.960
between the years of 1979 to 1999, and you&nbsp;
outlined that in your book, LSD in the Mind of the&nbsp;

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.360
Universe. Before we get into all that you&nbsp;
experienced and what you gleaned and learned&nbsp;

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:46.520
from those sessions, can we just begin with&nbsp;
talking a little bit about what you've noticed&nbsp;

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.360
in the last, oh, I don't know, 10 plus years&nbsp;
or more where it seems that the taboo related&nbsp;

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.840
to psychedelics seems to be shifting. The&nbsp;
types of psychedelics there are out there&nbsp;

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.600
and what their uses are for, not each one,&nbsp;
but sort of overall why people do this.&nbsp;

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.560
And today we're going to focus on&nbsp;
specifically the cosmic exploration of them.&nbsp;

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.960
Well, as you know, there&nbsp;
is a worldwide renaissance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.000
of research taking place in psychedelics.
At the forefront of that research is the focus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.840
on therapeutic healing. That's what's bringing
psychedelics back into the intellectual and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.560
clinical community. The capacity of these
amplifying substances to bring forward the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.520
personal unconscious and to unearth the wounds
of the personal unconscious and to assist and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.320
deepen and accelerate people's healings of trauma
and various issues, post-traumatic stress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.800
depression, things like this.
A second use of psychedelics, overlapping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.680
but different from therapeutic healing,
is using psychedelics to promote spiritual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.320
awakening, an awakening to the true nature,
our deeper nature underneath our personality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.200
nature, to deepen our&nbsp;
understanding, our experience&nbsp;

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.640
of the wisdom of the universe, the intelligence of&nbsp;
the universe, the consciousness of the universe,&nbsp;

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.080
classic kind of spiritual awakening&nbsp;
to the nature of spiritual reality.&nbsp;

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.080
And that's why I got started in this work,&nbsp;
really, was to deepen my spiritual awakening.&nbsp;

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.800
But the protocol that I ended up using was so&nbsp;
strong and so evocative. Within a few years,&nbsp;

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.040
I was having experiences that went far beyond&nbsp;
anything that could be understood in terms of&nbsp;

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.240
either therapeutic healing or spiritual&nbsp;
awakening. And I came to understand over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.320
time that the project
that I was involved in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.680
was cosmological exploration. That&nbsp;
is, a systematic attempt to explore&nbsp;

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.880
the deep structure of spiritual&nbsp;
reality or the deep structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.400
of the consciousness of the universe
itself. So that's really what my work is about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:19.240
I'm not a clinician. I am trained as a philosopher
of religion. What interested me from Stan Grof's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.120
early work was the capacity of these substances
to lay bare not only the personal issues, but to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.880
enter into deep communion with the consciousness
that lies behind existence. Can you share,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.720
give us an overview of the&nbsp;
different types of psychedelics?&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.520
Just to kind of list them off, of course, because&nbsp;
there are many, but we're going to primarily talk&nbsp;

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.720
about your experience with LSD today. Many&nbsp;
psychedelics. I mean, I guess the primary ones&nbsp;

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:59.400
that come to mind are LSD, psilocybin, MDMA,&nbsp;
though that's probably an empathogen more than&nbsp;

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.360
psychedelic, 5-MeO-DMT, salvia divinorum, San&nbsp;
Pedro. I mean, I think these are the types of&nbsp;

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.080
psychedelics that most people are familiar&nbsp;
with. There are all sorts of derivatives. MDMA,&nbsp;

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.080
they're derivatives off of each of&nbsp;
these little tweaks along the way.&nbsp;

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.560
And we also want to say upfront that you're&nbsp;
not recommending necessarily that people&nbsp;

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.600
engage in the same process you engaged in&nbsp;
or advocating necessarily for the use of&nbsp;

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:41.840
these per se. Is that right? Absolutely.&nbsp;
There are a large percentage of the population&nbsp;

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.480
who shouldn't be doing psychedelics at all. These&nbsp;
are very powerful amplifiers of consciousness.&nbsp;

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.720
They have tremendous evocative potential. And&nbsp;
there are persons who should not be venturing&nbsp;

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.200
into these waters. And no one should be&nbsp;
venturing into these waters without really good,&nbsp;

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.800
high quality, professional guides accompanying&nbsp;
you to keep you safe as you enter into this&nbsp;

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:13.360
territory. Now, the protocol that I chose to work&nbsp;
with was high doses of LSD. I worked at 500 to&nbsp;

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:21.080
600 micrograms. And looking back at it, at&nbsp;
the end of it, I think, what was I thinking?&nbsp;

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:29.040
That was ridiculous. But I had a deep hunger to&nbsp;
explore the nature of existence. And working at&nbsp;

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:36.960
these high doses took me on an adventure of&nbsp;
a lifetime. But this is very demanding work,&nbsp;

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.280
which requires a lot of&nbsp;
concentration, a lot of safeguards,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:49.600
and a lot of time to assimilate the experiences
And I really, knowing what I know now, at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:56.840
end of this journey, I strongly recommend against
using the protocol that I used. If I were doing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:03.640
over again, I would work with lower doses of
psychedelics. I'd be much gentler on myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.840
I'd be willing to sort of peel&nbsp;
back the layers of the psyche&nbsp;

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:15.920
much more gradually than I did in this work. So&nbsp;
to begin into your journey, what was the impetus&nbsp;

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:23.640
for you to embark on this deep exploration with&nbsp;
high doses of LSD? Well, I had just finished my&nbsp;

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:32.000
graduate work. I had just started my academic&nbsp;
career. At the time, I was a pretty convinced,&nbsp;

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.440
atheistically inclined agnostic. And then I&nbsp;
met the work of two people. Ian Stevenson,&nbsp;

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.880
whose work on reincarnation convinced me&nbsp;
that reincarnation was a simple fact of life.&nbsp;

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.520
And the other one was Stanislav Grof. And I read&nbsp;
his book Realms of the Human Unconscious. I read&nbsp;

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:58.600
it in 1978, two years after it had just come out.&nbsp;
And as soon as I read that book, I recognized that&nbsp;

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:06.840
Stan's work had tremendous significance, not&nbsp;
only for psychotherapy, but it had tremendous&nbsp;

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.680
significance for philosophy&nbsp;
of religion, philosophy of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:16.960
consciousness. And I knew that if I was ever
going to make a contribution in this field,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:25.400
I had to undergo my own therapeutic exploration,
my own regimen. So very uncomfortably, I made a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:33.760
decision to break the law in a very, I hope,
disciplined and restrained way. And I began a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:41.480
series of psychedelic sessions, which ended up,
much to my surprise, ended up lasting 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.920
I worked for four years, I stopped for six years,
and then I worked for another 10 years, finishing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:56.200
in 1999. And then I spent 20 years after that,
digesting these experiences, analyzing them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:03.680
sifting them, sorting them, and then wrote
LSD in the Mind of the Universe in 2019,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.760
20 years after I had stopped my sessions.
Can you give us a sense of what your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.080
sessions were like? How you began?&nbsp;
You mentioned that you had a sitter,&nbsp;

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:23.520
somebody with you in that process. How did&nbsp;
you choose to set up your set and setting?&nbsp;

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.120
Well, basically, I followed the protocol&nbsp;
established by Stan, reflected in his book&nbsp;

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:33.960
Realms of the Human Unconscious, and then&nbsp;
clarified further in his book LSD Psychotherapy,&nbsp;

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:43.080
where he lays out all the nuts and bolts of&nbsp;
working in this modality. I was always in a room&nbsp;

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:51.040
separated from the world, protected from the&nbsp;
world, no interruptions, by myself with my sitter,&nbsp;

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.480
who was my wife at the time, who's a clinical&nbsp;
psychologist who studied the psychedelic&nbsp;

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:06.600
literature with me. I'm lying down, I'm using&nbsp;
eye shades and headphones, conventional kind of&nbsp;

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:14.800
classic psychedelic deep introspection, deep&nbsp;
meditative orientation, very carefully curated&nbsp;

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:23.280
music to support the opening and the peaking and&nbsp;
the closing of a session. So the basic idea is&nbsp;

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:32.240
to profoundly energize the unconscious and then&nbsp;
to create an environment where the energies rising&nbsp;

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.680
through your unconscious can be engaged cleanly&nbsp;
and clearly. If you stay in contact with the&nbsp;

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.880
physical world, if you're in dialogue with friends&nbsp;
or if you're going to a concert, that's all fine&nbsp;

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:51.080
and good, but that's just not what this work&nbsp;
is about. It requires a powerful amplification&nbsp;

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:58.160
of the unconscious, but then creating a very&nbsp;
carefully controlled environment that allows&nbsp;

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:06.640
you to engage what rises conscientiously and most&nbsp;
importantly to follow whatever arises to its very&nbsp;

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:15.040
bottom level, to the bottom line, to let it take&nbsp;
you wherever it wants to take you. If I recall&nbsp;

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:22.960
correctly, it was typically on Saturdays because&nbsp;
you had a very important day job teaching at a&nbsp;

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.600
university and I think your sessions lasted about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.880
was it eight hours each&nbsp;
roughly? Yeah, pretty much.&nbsp;

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.280
I would start in the early morning and I would&nbsp;
finish by nighttime that night, a late afternoon&nbsp;

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:42.200
nighttime, so a session would last eight, ten&nbsp;
hours or so of the carryover tail, but basically&nbsp;

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:50.480
a good hard eight hours each session. So it's a&nbsp;
major commitment. Eventually I developed spiritual&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:58.600
protocols that I would adopt in the weeks leading&nbsp;
up to a session and in the weeks after a session&nbsp;

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.280
and particularly the day or two before a&nbsp;
session and the day or two after the session.&nbsp;

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:11.360
You really have to work with that time and&nbsp;
with the energy that is stirred in you because&nbsp;

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:18.160
if you're working with very high doses of a&nbsp;
powerful psychedelic like LSD, it taps into&nbsp;

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.560
very deep levels of the universe and it takes&nbsp;
your body and mind and subtle energy system&nbsp;

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:31.040
a time to process that material and so it's a&nbsp;
major time commitment. It's just not the day of.&nbsp;

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:38.560
It's several days before and several days after.&nbsp;
You also took meticulous notes from your sessions&nbsp;

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:45.840
as well, which is a lot of what's in your book.&nbsp;
Yeah, that's the first step of integration is to&nbsp;

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:53.840
create an accurate phenomenological description&nbsp;
of exactly what happens in your sessions because&nbsp;

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:59.720
integration is the foundation of your future&nbsp;
sessions. If you don't integrate your sessions&nbsp;

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.640
thoroughly and conscientiously, then you're&nbsp;
not going to have as likely to have as deep an&nbsp;

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:12.560
experience the next session out. So there's a&nbsp;
circle where you open, but then you integrate&nbsp;

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.960
what you experience, which lays the foundation&nbsp;
for the deeper opening in your next session.&nbsp;

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.840
Yeah, it seems like they built upon each other.&nbsp;

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:30.600
In my experience, they did. Again, I kind of&nbsp;
standardized my sessions as much as possible,&nbsp;

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.720
eliminating as many variables. I always was&nbsp;
using the same substance, the same dose,&nbsp;

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.800
the same set and setting, the same sitter,&nbsp;
even in the same part of the country.&nbsp;

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:48.880
If you change those variables, it changes the&nbsp;
subtlety of the interface between your mind&nbsp;

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:55.280
and the universe's mind that you're engaging.&nbsp;
So by trying to standardize those variables,&nbsp;

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:02.040
you create an environment of sustained&nbsp;
communion or dialogue with this deeper&nbsp;

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:10.440
consciousness. And by creating that sustained&nbsp;
clear contact point, my experience was that&nbsp;

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:16.160
the universe or the consciousness, whatever&nbsp;
it was that I was engaging, that consciousness&nbsp;

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:24.200
took me deeper and deeper in a systematic fashion.&nbsp;
It was like taking a series of graduate courses&nbsp;

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:31.800
in consciousness. It was a tremendous, rigorous,&nbsp;
systematic expansion of my frame of reality.&nbsp;

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:40.200
Why did you choose this path versus, for example,&nbsp;
sitting in meditation or some other spiritual&nbsp;

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:47.760
path that can lead you deeper into these realms?&nbsp;
Well, I had been meditating since college. I was&nbsp;

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.560
familiar with meditation. I'd meditated in a&nbsp;
couple of different traditions by that time.&nbsp;

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.280
And I'm a professor of religious studies, so&nbsp;
I had a good solid grounding in the world's&nbsp;

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:04.720
spiritual traditions. I taught courses in&nbsp;
psychology of religion and transpersonal studies&nbsp;

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:13.640
and comparative mysticism. So I understood the&nbsp;
world of meditation and contemplative practice.&nbsp;

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:19.880
I started by thinking that these sessions would&nbsp;
basically help me break through some of the&nbsp;

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:26.400
obstacles that had risen in my contemplative&nbsp;
practice. What I found, however, was that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.920
this was a protocol of
spiritual exploration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.360
took me deeper than I had ever imagined&nbsp;
being possible when I began this&nbsp;

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:44.560
work. And once I was into it a couple of years,&nbsp;
I had developed an aptitude for working in these&nbsp;

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.720
states. And I never stopped meditating. I was&nbsp;
always meditating through this time. I was always&nbsp;

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:56.120
doing yoga and various spiritual practices. In&nbsp;
fact, I think that the deeper you want to go&nbsp;

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:02.760
in working with psychedelics, the more important&nbsp;
it is to have a daily spiritual practice that&nbsp;

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:10.600
helps anchor you and helps you absorb the&nbsp;
experiences that you unleash with psychedelics.&nbsp;

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:17.640
It was a different protocol. It gave me access&nbsp;
to states of consciousness that you can reach&nbsp;

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:24.680
with meditation, but only with lifetimes,&nbsp;
not just one lifetime, but many lifetimes&nbsp;

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:30.880
of meditation. So I differentiate between&nbsp;
what I call the path of temporary immersion,&nbsp;

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:37.480
which is working with psychedelics, as you're&nbsp;
only immersed in these states for hours at a time,&nbsp;

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.960
versus the path of presence, of contemplative&nbsp;
presence, where it's a slower path,&nbsp;

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:50.280
but it tends to produce states of abiding&nbsp;
transparency, whereas the temporary path&nbsp;

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:59.040
pushes you deep into these conscious domains,&nbsp;
and then it wears off and you come back.&nbsp;

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.840
They're complementing approaches,&nbsp;
but they are different.&nbsp;

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:10.160
Let's begin with your very first session. Just&nbsp;
to get us started, because I know you've done&nbsp;

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:17.720
many of them, to give the listeners, the audience,&nbsp;
the viewers a taste of what your experience was&nbsp;

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.200
like that led you to keep&nbsp;
wanting to come back for more.&nbsp;

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.240
Probably the most significant thing&nbsp;
that happened in my first session&nbsp;

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:33.840
was that I entered a phase of the work where I&nbsp;
could not remember who I was. I could not remember&nbsp;

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.240
what I was, what I did for a living. I could&nbsp;
not remember whether I was a man or a woman,&nbsp;

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:47.520
even. It was a complete interruption of my stream&nbsp;
of consciousness that was telling me who and what&nbsp;

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:54.640
I was. This was a frightening experience, a&nbsp;
jarring experience, but in the end, I learned&nbsp;

00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:01.280
that it was a very helpful experience because it&nbsp;
showed me that it would be pointless for me to try&nbsp;

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:08.360
to stay in control, because if you can't control&nbsp;
your self-knowledge, then that's about as basic&nbsp;

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:15.400
as you can get. This session taught me that&nbsp;
in this work, you have to surrender radically&nbsp;

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:23.280
to whatever arises. It saved me a lot of time&nbsp;
and energy later when more demanding experiences&nbsp;

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:29.560
opened. There's a tendency to sort of want to&nbsp;
maintain control, to hold on to reality as you&nbsp;

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:35.680
know it. In this type of work, you have to let go&nbsp;
of reality as you know it. You have to completely&nbsp;

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:44.200
surrender and go where it wants to take you. That&nbsp;
was just the first lesson that basically said,&nbsp;

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:52.960
don't waste time trying to maintain control.&nbsp;
Before we go further into some of your sessions&nbsp;

00:19:52.960 --> 00:20:00.520
and giving us a taste of your experiences and&nbsp;
what you learned, have you come to understand&nbsp;

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.840
the physiology of what LSD is doing on the&nbsp;
human physiology, the nervous system? Of course,&nbsp;

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.400
a lot of people think about connect consciousness&nbsp;
with the brain, which of course, it's more than&nbsp;

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.760
that. However, I recently spoke with Jill Bolte&nbsp;
Taylor, who is a neuroanatomist from Harvard.&nbsp;

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:23.920
She wrote a well-known book, Her Stroke of&nbsp;
Insight, where she had a stroke. She had an&nbsp;

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.200
eight-year journey of recovery back, but she&nbsp;
described that our personal sense of identity&nbsp;

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:40.600
is just the size of a peanut in our brains. I&nbsp;
follow the discussion of the scientists about&nbsp;

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:49.680
what is biochemistry of LSD and how it affects&nbsp;
brain structure and default mode network&nbsp;

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:56.040
interruption and those type of discussions,&nbsp;
but I'm not really drawn to that conversation.&nbsp;

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:03.640
I'm not primarily a scientist in training. I&nbsp;
basically have taken more of a psychological&nbsp;

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.880
approach to understanding that&nbsp;
these substances, whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:15.240
their mechanism, they amplify consciousness.
They hypersensitize consciousness and they allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:24.880
you to experience dimensions of your mind and
of reality beyond your mind, which usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.880
were kept in a space-time kind of focus
where we don't experience these subtler textures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:39.440
Right. Where we can feel trapped inside our bodies
or in what most people consider is primarily the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.360
materialistic world, which we know is
there's much more than that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.200
which is what we're talking about today.
Yeah. Yeah. That's the real draw to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:56.240
I basically work within the frame of reference
that I had acquired from Stan Grof and some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:03.440
other earlier researchers using a description
of the dynamic qualities of psychedelic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:09.200
consciousness or the consciousness that arises
with psychedelics. I'll let the science guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.800
sort out the physiology of it.&nbsp;
I know that that's interesting&nbsp;

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:20.320
and I find that often the physiological&nbsp;
discussion is carried out within reductive&nbsp;

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.960
metaphysical assumptions, which really is&nbsp;
not helping our conversation right now.&nbsp;

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.000
You mean the conversation in general.&nbsp;
We're having a good conversation, right?&nbsp;

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.520
I mean, particularly the attempts to sort of&nbsp;
understand, to correlate what's happening in&nbsp;

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.640
the brain physiologically with the states&nbsp;
of consciousness that one is experiencing,&nbsp;

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:46.680
but often these discussions take place within&nbsp;
a certain set of metaphysical assumptions,&nbsp;

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:53.320
and too often those metaphysical assumptions&nbsp;
tend to be reductive. They tend to sort of lean&nbsp;

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.840
in the direction of thinking that physical&nbsp;
reality is the dominant and determining reality&nbsp;

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:06.200
of one's experience. But when you actually look&nbsp;
at the experiences that emerge in psychedelics,&nbsp;

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:12.280
that restrictive metaphysical&nbsp;
framework is shattered.&nbsp;

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.200
Yeah. Well, I just want to touch&nbsp;
on it for now and primarily because&nbsp;

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:24.480
there may be those listening thinking, well,&nbsp;
this is just your brain on drugs and it's causing&nbsp;

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:30.800
the whole chemical reaction. That's been discussed&nbsp;
with near-death experiencers and so forth, but&nbsp;

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.000
research has shown that there's more going&nbsp;
on with that. So I definitely understand&nbsp;

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.040
what you're saying and we can get into the&nbsp;
veracity or the trusting of these experiences&nbsp;

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:47.960
a little later in our conversation. Can you&nbsp;
take us more into some of your experiences&nbsp;

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:54.040
with your sessions with LSD to give us&nbsp;
a taste of what that was like for you?&nbsp;

00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:00.280
That's a hard question. I mean, let's give a&nbsp;
context. Some very influential books were written&nbsp;

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.960
based on a very limited number of psychedelic&nbsp;
experiences. So Aldous Huxley wrote his very&nbsp;

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:13.720
important, beautiful book, The Doors of&nbsp;
Perception, after only one mescaline experience.&nbsp;

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:19.840
Houston Smith wrote his book, his&nbsp;
Collected Reflections on Psychedelics,&nbsp;

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:26.640
Cleansing the Doors of Perception, after only&nbsp;
taking LSD six times over the course of his&nbsp;

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:34.720
lifetime. Michael Pollan wrote his book, which&nbsp;
is a very important, very helpful book, but after&nbsp;

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:45.040
only a handful of psychedelic experiences. So the&nbsp;
challenge that anyone faces coming into my work&nbsp;

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:53.440
are the challenges that I have conveying my&nbsp;
experiences is just how long the journey was,&nbsp;

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.080
how many layers of consciousness opened in that&nbsp;
journey. It's not simply a matter of opening 73&nbsp;

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:07.720
times to the same interface, is that there is a&nbsp;
cycle of death and rebirth that reproduces itself&nbsp;

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.920
so that death breaks you free of one level of&nbsp;
reality, physical reality, in the beginning.&nbsp;

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:19.680
It enters, takes you into a non-physical,&nbsp;
spiritual reality, and you work there for a while,&nbsp;

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.040
but if you work consistently, eventually&nbsp;
you'll go through another death and rebirth&nbsp;

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.640
that will take you into another level of&nbsp;
reality where you have to learn the whole&nbsp;

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:35.040
rules of that level of reality, which then&nbsp;
will be followed taking you into another level.&nbsp;

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:42.840
So the problem I have with answering your&nbsp;
question is so many levels of reality.&nbsp;

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.160
If I focused on any one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.040
I'd be leaving out so many others. So&nbsp;
let me just say this in the beginning.&nbsp;

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:56.480
When I was looking over the whole of my sessions&nbsp;
and putting them together in order to write this&nbsp;

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:03.600
storyline of what happened on those sessions,&nbsp;
I eventually differentiated or distinguished&nbsp;

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:12.200
five different broad categories that my sessions&nbsp;
fell into. First, having to do with personal mind,&nbsp;

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:19.040
your personal unconscious, your personal story.&nbsp;
Second, collective mind, which has to do with the&nbsp;

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:25.240
collective psyche, the psyche of humanity,&nbsp;
the species mind. The third, archetypal mind,&nbsp;

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:32.000
which in my case, I'm primarily addressing&nbsp;
not archetypes in the Jungian sense, but&nbsp;

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:40.040
archetypes more in the Platonic sense of the&nbsp;
levels, dimensions of reality, which lie outside&nbsp;

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:48.040
time and space and outside the collective&nbsp;
psyche. Causal levels of reality are&nbsp;

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.400
the level of oneness, the level where&nbsp;
oneness becomes the dominant reality.&nbsp;

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:59.960
And then beyond that, diamond luminosity, a&nbsp;
particularly clear dimension of light that&nbsp;

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:06.680
I encountered and worked with in the last five&nbsp;
years of my work. So all of my experiences,&nbsp;

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:13.280
I can kind of lay them out as a sequential&nbsp;
journey, starting at the level of personal mind,&nbsp;

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.440
moving into the level of collective mind,&nbsp;
archetypal mind, so on and so forth.&nbsp;

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.240
Well, I would love to discuss each of those&nbsp;
levels you went into. What I recall reading&nbsp;

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.640
in your book that seemed to be common themes of&nbsp;
your sessions were that it was, like you said&nbsp;

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:35.120
earlier, a letting go and that there was, it&nbsp;
seemed a lot of pain and suffering to actually&nbsp;

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:41.680
reach to these deeper levels of consciousness.&nbsp;
Can you share what that was like for you?&nbsp;

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.880
In the early stage, and when I was working at&nbsp;
the level of personal mind, that the pain and&nbsp;

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.880
suffering came in the form of what Stan Grof&nbsp;
has very well discussed and presented in his&nbsp;

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:57.880
discussion of the perinatal level&nbsp;
of consciousness. Basically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.040
sometimes reliving your birth,
but confronting the fundamental existential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:09.560
questions that dominate life and physical reality.
Is there any meaning in the universe? Is there any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:16.440
order, any design to it, any intelligence of it?
Because at just the physical level, everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.960
we love, everything we know will be destroyed at
death. Is there any reality beyond death? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:28.800
that's, and therefore you, you have to face the
deepest levels of metaphysical angst in order to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:35.600
move through this until eventually your identity
is just crushed and shattered. That's easier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.360
for some people to undergo&nbsp;
than it is for other people,&nbsp;

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:45.320
but you have to surrender your time-space identity&nbsp;
in order to gain access to the next level of&nbsp;

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:53.360
reality. At that next level of reality, I&nbsp;
continue to have a deepening confrontation&nbsp;

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:59.960
with pain, suffering, and violence. It&nbsp;
was so deep and it lasted so long and it&nbsp;

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:06.280
seemed to encompass so many hundreds of thousands&nbsp;
of persons in so many thousands of years&nbsp;

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.960
that I eventually came to the&nbsp;
decision that this was not some,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.440
didn't represent a deepening or
cleansing or healing of my personal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.960
psyche. That what was being healed&nbsp;
here was some aspect of the collective&nbsp;

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:28.520
psyche of humanity itself, that something was&nbsp;
using my sessions in order to set in motion&nbsp;

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:38.480
a reconciliation and a healing of levels of pain&nbsp;
that were fundamentally collective, not personal.&nbsp;

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.440
And then more levels of death and rebirth&nbsp;
where the nature of death and suffering&nbsp;

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:51.560
changes the deeper you go. But the&nbsp;
basic principle is pretty simple.&nbsp;

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:58.200
If you want to experience oneness with God or if&nbsp;
you want to experience a deep experience of the&nbsp;

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:07.080
nature of the mind of the universe, the problem&nbsp;
is our historical consciousness is just too small.&nbsp;

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:12.200
If you want to literally experience it, I mean&nbsp;
it's one thing to think about it, but to actually&nbsp;

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:19.160
immerse yourself in the communion with these&nbsp;
levels of reality, your small identity has to be&nbsp;

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:25.760
surrendered and you have to flow, be willing&nbsp;
to flow into a larger level of identity.&nbsp;

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:32.560
So eventually you're going into levels of reality&nbsp;
where it would be a misrepresentation to think&nbsp;

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:39.320
that Chris Bache went and had those experiences.&nbsp;
Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed,&nbsp;

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:47.880
dissolved in order for these levels of&nbsp;
consciousness to manifest inside Chris Bache's&nbsp;

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:55.360
awareness. But the fact that I remember those&nbsp;
experiences doesn't mean that my personality&nbsp;

00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:01.520
identity was present when those experiences were&nbsp;
being had. It's kind of like you have to lose&nbsp;

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:08.280
yourself, enter into communion with the universe,&nbsp;
and then when you come back you gather your&nbsp;

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.400
and then my personality synthesizes them,&nbsp;
digests them, trying to integrate them.&nbsp;

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:20.840
But it's a pulsing. You learn to sort of&nbsp;
surrender completely, open, breathe deeply,&nbsp;

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.720
you receive teachings, then&nbsp;
you bring it all back in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:31.440
and then you try to integrate it and consolidate
it. What are some of the teachings you received?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:39.280
That the universe is a manifestation of a single
consciousness, a massive consciousness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.920
beyond anything that we've ever begun to grasp
in our Western religious and philosophical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:54.200
traditions, that creation is an&nbsp;
intentional act. It is an act …&nbsp;

00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:02.240
I hate to use the word design because those&nbsp;
theories are problematic, but there is an&nbsp;

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:09.000
intelligence manifesting itself in time and&nbsp;
space that we are part of this intelligence,&nbsp;

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.280
that our nature is of the same nature as its&nbsp;
nature. So this is an ancient idea. Atman is&nbsp;

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:22.560
Brahman. The essence of the individual is the&nbsp;
essence of the totality. That reincarnation&nbsp;

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.080
is simply a fact of life. I don't think we get&nbsp;
anywhere in trying to understand existence unless&nbsp;

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:34.760
we understand the pulse of life, unless we&nbsp;
understand that our current life is just&nbsp;

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:43.040
the most recent in many, many repeating cycles of&nbsp;
life and death. That there is an underlying logic&nbsp;

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:49.160
to the circumstances within which we find&nbsp;
ourselves. The Buddhists and the Hindus talk about&nbsp;

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.240
karma, that there is a deeper&nbsp;
intentionality working itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.240
out in the circumstances of&nbsp;
our existence, and that… our&nbsp;

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:06.760
evolutionary existence, is not simply driven&nbsp;
by blind chance and mechanical processes,&nbsp;

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.280
which are purely mechanical, but that there&nbsp;
is a deeper intelligence manifesting itself&nbsp;

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.400
in the circumstances of our life, in&nbsp;
the challenges that we are facing,&nbsp;

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:26.880
and inviting us to become more by the end&nbsp;
of our life than we were in the beginning.&nbsp;

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:34.640
So just a few touch points. Yeah, yeah. Going&nbsp;
back to your experiences in these sessions,&nbsp;

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:41.040
it seems that death and rebirth and a&nbsp;
purification process happened in many,&nbsp;

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.320
if not all, of your sessions. Yeah. What did&nbsp;
you come to understand was the reason for that?&nbsp;

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:52.080
First, the general structure of the&nbsp;
sessions as I experienced them is that&nbsp;

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.040
every session, there's a sort of a rhythm&nbsp;
of a cycle with variations, but basically,&nbsp;

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:03.120
the first early hours of a session are spent&nbsp;
in some type of deep purification process,&nbsp;

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:11.880
deep confrontation. And then if you surrender to&nbsp;
that process and let it take you, it reaches a&nbsp;

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:18.480
culmination point. There is a surrender, a death&nbsp;
rebirth process in which you are then spun into&nbsp;

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:25.840
transpersonal ecstatic places for the remainder&nbsp;
of the session. And then that runs its course.&nbsp;

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.720
And then the next session, however many months&nbsp;
between, and I was doing about five sessions a&nbsp;

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:38.920
year on average, starts you right back into&nbsp;
the purification part and carrying you then&nbsp;

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:46.040
forward into the ecstatic portion. So the purpose&nbsp;
of the purification and the purpose of the death&nbsp;

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:50.400
is simply cleaning, just cleaning,&nbsp;
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.&nbsp;

00:34:53.480 --> 00:35:01.720
When you eventually come to have deep experience&nbsp;
of the fundamental identity of your nature&nbsp;

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:09.320
and the divine nature, or the infinite nature,&nbsp;
that you are the infinite, then it gives you a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:15.760
different perspective on what it is that was&nbsp;
present preventing you all those years from&nbsp;

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:23.000
realizing that. what was keeping you from it. And&nbsp;
it's this tight conditioning of the psyche. It's&nbsp;

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.640
the type conditioning which is associated with&nbsp;
your time-space consciousness. And that has to&nbsp;

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.320
be softened, it has to be released,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.760
it has to be let go in order to&nbsp;
move into these expansive places.&nbsp;

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:43.200
So the death rebirth cycle is actually a&nbsp;
purification cycle. In fact, I learned that&nbsp;

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:52.080
death is actually an intense stage of&nbsp;
purification. Once you've died many times,&nbsp;

00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:00.880
you learn that truly it's impossible to die. What&nbsp;
you are can die. The structure of your life can&nbsp;

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:08.640
die. Reality as you have known it can die. But the&nbsp;
phoenix always rises. The essence of the person&nbsp;

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:14.560
always emerges in a different reality&nbsp;
with new potentials, with new capacities,&nbsp;

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:20.120
but it's impossible to die. And the reason&nbsp;
we can't die is, I think, because our nature&nbsp;

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:26.920
is the nature of the divine. So the form can die,&nbsp;
but the essence cannot die. Once you know that,&nbsp;

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:34.360
then I began to understand that the experience&nbsp;
of death, which kept coming up in my sessions,&nbsp;

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.600
was actually an experience, an&nbsp;
advanced experience of purification.&nbsp;

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:47.360
When purification reaches a critical portion,&nbsp;
position, so that it begins to dissolve the&nbsp;

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:53.960
fundamental structures of what you had known&nbsp;
as real, then you have reached the death point,&nbsp;

00:36:53.960 --> 00:37:00.800
the death and rebirth point. And death has come&nbsp;
back to grace you again. So from my perspective,&nbsp;

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.720
experiencing death in a psychedelic session&nbsp;
or to experience horrendous suffering or pain&nbsp;

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:12.280
is actually an exciting stage in the work. It's&nbsp;
not something to be avoided. A lot of people worry&nbsp;

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.080
about, oh, I don't want to have a bad session. We&nbsp;
got to do everything we can to avoid having a bad&nbsp;

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.320
session. But I think that's a&nbsp;
radical misunderstanding of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:27.520
depth of consciousness and the power that
technique gives you. In my experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.320
you begin to understand that&nbsp;
the deeper the purification,&nbsp;

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:39.040
the deeper the ecstatic immersion, so that you&nbsp;
begin to welcome the purification. You begin to&nbsp;

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:46.040
welcome the challenges that you face. You begin&nbsp;
to welcome the bad sessions in order to actualize&nbsp;

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:53.560
a higher, more intimate experience with the&nbsp;
divine consciousness. Now, that's assuming&nbsp;

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.640
that you're working in a completely controlled&nbsp;
environment. You have done all the homework.&nbsp;

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:04.840
You've done your preparation. You can have a bad&nbsp;
session for a lot of bad reasons. You can be in&nbsp;

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:12.240
the wrong place, the wrong time, not preparing&nbsp;
yourself, wrong set and setting. Those can give&nbsp;

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:18.760
you bad sessions, which are not of the quality&nbsp;
that I'm talking about. Yeah, I will share that&nbsp;

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:27.280
when I was in high school, a group of friends&nbsp;
wanted to do LSD or acid as it was called as well.&nbsp;

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:34.440
And I did not partake. However, I was the sitter&nbsp;
and my role was to make sure that everybody did&nbsp;

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:40.520
have a good experience, which actually&nbsp;
the few times that that happened was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.760
always the case. But, I know you mentioned that a&nbsp;

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:48.680
bad trip is not necessarily a bad trip. Yeah.&nbsp;
So you suggest that that's part of the process,&nbsp;

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:56.440
but one needs to be… have done the preparation&nbsp;
ahead of time to know what they're getting into.&nbsp;

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:03.280
Yeah, I mean, psychedelics amplify consciousness&nbsp;
and most people will take us like… I don't want&nbsp;

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:10.600
to overgeneralize… Some people take a psychedelic&nbsp;
and what they're looking for is a good afternoon,&nbsp;

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.800
a little more openness to the life of the&nbsp;
universe, a little more openness to the love&nbsp;

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:23.280
that's in the universe. And they maintain the&nbsp;
fundamental parameters of their personality,&nbsp;

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:29.520
get softer and expansive and let some of&nbsp;
these experiences in, which is perfectly fine.&nbsp;

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.960
But if you want to go into a deep dive, if you&nbsp;
want to explore the deep structure of existence,&nbsp;

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:42.920
if you want to transcend space, transcend&nbsp;
time, move into the deep future,&nbsp;

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.480
that requires a more carefully&nbsp;
laid out strategy in working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:54.200
with these states. So I'm not suggesting
that the way I work with these states is the only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:54.200 --> 00:40:02.800
way, beneficial way to work with these states is
simply for me as a philosopher, I was looking for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:12.880
depth of immersion, depth of understanding
that takes some serious work. So while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:20.600
we're on the topic of this death and rebirth,
surrendering, purification, can you share with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.960
us what is it that dies and reborn? I know you
outline in your book a few different areas that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:36.560
you've come to understand. Yeah, well basically
this became a real intellectual issue for me. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:42.440
mean, when you experience dying and being reborn
through multiple levels of reality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.120
it then becomes a question, what&nbsp;
is it that's actually dying?&nbsp;

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:52.640
You may have deep and profound experiences of&nbsp;
dying years after you've gone through ego death,&nbsp;

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:59.000
and it's not simply the ego dying over and over&nbsp;
and over again. It's a different kind of death.&nbsp;

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.440
So at the appendix in LSD and the Mind of the&nbsp;
Universe, I have an appendix on what dies and&nbsp;

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:13.640
is reborn, and I suggest four levels of maybe&nbsp;
beginning to address that question. One of them&nbsp;

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:21.400
is what dies is our personal ego. Second is&nbsp;
what dies is some aspect of the collective ego,&nbsp;

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:30.160
of the collective psyche. Third, what dies is what&nbsp;
I call the shamanic persona, complicated concept,&nbsp;

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:37.480
but when you've been on the journey for a long&nbsp;
time, when you move into psychedelic space,&nbsp;

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:44.440
you resume your psychedelic persona, you&nbsp;
resume your shamanic persona. It's like,&nbsp;

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.200
as a friend of mine said, you&nbsp;
walk with the old ones once again.&nbsp;

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:58.240
You've made the transition often enough that&nbsp;
your shamanic persona is the living integration&nbsp;

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:04.520
of all of your psychedelic experiences up to&nbsp;
that point in time. So let's say, in this case,&nbsp;

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:11.240
20 sessions in, working at the level of the&nbsp;
collective psyche into what I call the ocean&nbsp;

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:20.680
of suffering, you stabilize a psychedelic&nbsp;
identity, a shamanic persona that integrates&nbsp;

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:26.560
all the experiences that you have had of&nbsp;
transpersonal states of consciousness beyond&nbsp;

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:33.800
your physical consciousness. If you are going to&nbsp;
go into yet a still deeper level of consciousness&nbsp;

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:41.560
beyond where you had lived before, then that&nbsp;
shamanic persona has to die. It has to surrender&nbsp;

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:47.160
in order for a new category instead&nbsp;
of a category of experiences to emerge&nbsp;

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:54.920
and for a still deeper shamanic persona to&nbsp;
emerge. And so I think in some advanced sessions,&nbsp;

00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:01.760
what is dying is the previous identity&nbsp;
or the identity which we had developed&nbsp;

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:08.640
from sustained psychedelic experiences over&nbsp;
many years. So that's I think the third thing&nbsp;

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:13.560
is I would suggest it's what I call the shamanic&nbsp;
persona or the shamanic self is dying. It's not&nbsp;

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:21.440
the egoic self. It's your psychedelic self,&nbsp;
which is dying. And then at a more subtle level,&nbsp;

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:29.720
I think what is dying is actually some&nbsp;
dimension of consciousness itself. And this&nbsp;

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:36.920
gets harder to discuss because it requires a more&nbsp;
subtle level of understanding. But basically,&nbsp;

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:43.240
sometimes in my late work, when I was working&nbsp;
at very deep levels of consciousness, when I was&nbsp;

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:52.720
working in deep levels of divine communion, I had&nbsp;
the experience that the divine level that I was&nbsp;

00:43:52.720 --> 00:44:02.400
experiencing came itself into a crescendo which&nbsp;
opened up a higher level of divine communion&nbsp;

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:09.560
than had been actualized up to this point in&nbsp;
time. Sri Aurobindo says when he's talking in&nbsp;

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:15.800
his metaphysical system, he says, looking down,&nbsp;
the divine sees all the levels of reality that&nbsp;

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:21.520
it's manifested, but it's a one-way mirror.&nbsp;
So the divine looking down sees everything.&nbsp;

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:27.560
But we, who are the divine looking up, tend to&nbsp;
see only the level that we are at. So it's a&nbsp;

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:35.200
one-way mirror. And that means even at deep, deep&nbsp;
levels, so we'd say there are aspects of divine&nbsp;

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:44.080
consciousness which cannot see or experience&nbsp;
into still deeper levels of divine consciousness.&nbsp;

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:53.680
And somehow, when we do this work, we actually can&nbsp;
facilitate a communion which takes place between&nbsp;

00:44:53.680 --> 00:45:00.320
two different levels of divine consciousness, far&nbsp;
beyond space-time, far beyond personal reality.&nbsp;

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:08.920
And there is a celebratory joy that takes place&nbsp;
when the divine wakes up to a still deeper level&nbsp;

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:15.000
of the divine. There is a communion that takes&nbsp;
place. There is a joyful celebration when the&nbsp;

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.240
higher is able to infuse itself more deeply into&nbsp;
the lower. And so I think that one of the things,&nbsp;

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:30.160
one way of thinking about what dies in very&nbsp;
advanced stages is some aspect of divine&nbsp;

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:38.200
consciousness itself. And yet, according&nbsp;
to your experiences, that death then&nbsp;

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:44.200
precipitates a rebirth, typically. Did you&nbsp;
discover that with consciousness itself as well?&nbsp;

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:52.040
Yes. Or the divine itself? Yeah, I mean,&nbsp;
it's, again, it's complicated because&nbsp;

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:58.120
we're rushing into an area where angels fear to&nbsp;
tread. Right, we're trying to put language to&nbsp;

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.880
an experience that many, sometimes, for&nbsp;
example, with near-death experiencers,&nbsp;

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.400
they'll say it's ineffable. So I&nbsp;
understand there's a language barrier.&nbsp;

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:13.040
Well, there is a language barrier, but for me,&nbsp;
the biggest issue is not the language barrier.&nbsp;

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:19.600
It is to lay the foundation, to lay the&nbsp;
prerequisites, to put things in place so that&nbsp;

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:25.640
you people can understand the language that&nbsp;
you want to use to describe these phenomena.&nbsp;

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:32.560
And it's not ordinary day language. It's not&nbsp;
everyday experience. It requires kind of a&nbsp;

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:39.640
conceptual reframe, a conceptual understanding,&nbsp;
so that you can describe certain things that&nbsp;

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:45.640
lie far beyond our ordinary, sensate experience.&nbsp;
But in some ways, it's not that different from&nbsp;

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:53.520
what a near-death episode person experiences. In&nbsp;
fact, I find, I feel the greatest correspondence&nbsp;

00:46:53.520 --> 00:47:00.880
and collegiality with people who have had&nbsp;
deep near-death episode experiences because&nbsp;

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:09.000
deep NDEs are the experiences of the closest&nbsp;
correlate to my experience with deep psychedelic&nbsp;

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.720
work. I think if you work with psychedelics&nbsp;
in a focused way over long periods of time,&nbsp;

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:22.240
you can access the same dimensions of&nbsp;
consciousness that someone accesses with an NDE,&nbsp;

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:29.440
a near-death experience. The difference is that&nbsp;
where for most people, the NDE-er experiences&nbsp;

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:35.640
this only once in their life. With sustained&nbsp;
psychedelics, you can go back multiple times&nbsp;

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:41.800
into this territory. And because you can go back&nbsp;
multiple times, you're taught there are more&nbsp;

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:48.560
nuances that are brought out in terms of how&nbsp;
this all works in the interplay of consciousness.&nbsp;

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:55.360
Can you help expand the conceptual framework&nbsp;
for us a little bit about what that experience&nbsp;

00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:02.840
has been like for you? Let me narrow it into&nbsp;
one particular, just to take one example.&nbsp;

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:08.400
When I was into the work now, I guess, four or&nbsp;
five years into the work, and I began to get&nbsp;

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:15.760
systematic access to archetypal reality, and I&nbsp;
began to have experiences. Every time I went into&nbsp;

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:23.720
my session, I entered a level of reality that I&nbsp;
knew was more real than space-time. It was the&nbsp;

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:32.760
primary reality. Space-time was the secondary&nbsp;
reality. I had encounters with vast beings that&nbsp;

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:38.800
I could not comprehend. I could not wrap my mind&nbsp;
around them. But I knew that these were the beings&nbsp;

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:47.040
who were responsible for creating space-time and&nbsp;
creating fundamental conditions within space-time.&nbsp;

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.640
But to have access to these realities,&nbsp;
everything that I had known about human history,&nbsp;

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:59.400
about human thought, everything about the history&nbsp;
of humanity had to fall away because the entire&nbsp;

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:08.680
collective psyche had to fall away in order&nbsp;
to enter into levels of consciousness that&nbsp;

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:15.920
humanity as a whole has not had access to or&nbsp;
has not experienced. Very few number of people&nbsp;

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:23.040
have access to these deep dimensions of&nbsp;
reality. But even in archetypal reality,&nbsp;

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:30.400
you're dealing with very profound levels of&nbsp;
consciousness, but there is still dualism there.&nbsp;

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:36.080
There is still a sense of self and other,&nbsp;
archetype and self, different archetypes.&nbsp;

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:46.720
There is a dualistic quality to it. When I went&nbsp;
beyond archetypal reality into causal reality,&nbsp;

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:55.040
that's the signature of causal reality that all&nbsp;
dualisms dissolve so that you begin to experience&nbsp;

00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:02.600
the world in whatever aspect you're experiencing&nbsp;
it. You're experiencing the world as a unified,&nbsp;

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:08.360
single entity, a single consciousness.&nbsp;
I think it was Plotinus who says,&nbsp;

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:14.000
the world breathes as one. And that's the&nbsp;
experience there, that there is a radical&nbsp;

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:23.400
transparency that opens where you are&nbsp;
fundamentally encountering the wholeness of life&nbsp;

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:31.040
that doesn't negate differentiation. In fact, it&nbsp;
affirms differentiation, but that differentiation&nbsp;

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:38.480
is experienced as different manifestations&nbsp;
of this single, integrated, whole, undivided&nbsp;

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:45.400
reality that we call God or we call the divine&nbsp;
or the one. That's a different category of&nbsp;

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:52.200
experience altogether from archetypal reality.&nbsp;
Can you share a little bit more about why it's&nbsp;

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:58.680
termed archetypal reality or that layer for&nbsp;
those who maybe aren't familiar with archetypes?&nbsp;

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:10.600
I use the term archetype in two senses here.&nbsp;
One is Jung talked about archetypes as the&nbsp;

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:17.120
primary themes, the repetitive themes of human&nbsp;
experience that become concretized in forms,&nbsp;

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:23.920
old man, old woman, trickster,&nbsp;
jokester, those clacks of shadow.&nbsp;

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:30.280
And then, so I think of them as kind of&nbsp;
archetypal in the sense of the primary,&nbsp;

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:36.360
the dominant themes of the&nbsp;
collective psyche. I see.&nbsp;

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.640
The second way in which archetypes&nbsp;
is used is in the Platonic tradition,&nbsp;

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:48.440
where Plato talks about the discovery of a level&nbsp;
of reality that lies beyond time-space altogether.&nbsp;

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:55.720
And I experience both. I experience Plato's&nbsp;
sense of archetypes. I experience that reality,&nbsp;

00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:04.760
but not in the way that Plato describes it. Plato&nbsp;
thinks of archetypes as eternal principles within&nbsp;

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:12.240
an eternal being. So they are the unchanging&nbsp;
prototypes that are used in creation, and they&nbsp;

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:18.400
exist within the mind of an unchanging divine,&nbsp;
unchanging infinite being. That's not how I&nbsp;

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.960
experience those archetypes. I experience them&nbsp;
as living entities, but living on a vast scale&nbsp;

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:33.640
of time and space, far beyond anything that we&nbsp;
know inside time and space. But what is shared&nbsp;

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:39.960
is that for something to manifest inside time&nbsp;
and space, it comes out of the oneness through&nbsp;

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:46.920
these fundamental intermediate structures,&nbsp;
which are very profound, super-intelligent,&nbsp;

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:53.720
super-powerful structures, and then focusing&nbsp;
this energy down into concretizing it,&nbsp;

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:59.720
concretizing it, into eventually manifesting&nbsp;
in space-time reality as we know it.&nbsp;

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:06.360
When I experience the collective psyche, and&nbsp;
I experience a lower level of archetypes,&nbsp;

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:13.320
in Jung's sense of archetypes, it was similar to&nbsp;
Jung's sense in that there were these archetypal&nbsp;

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:19.400
themes within humanity, but I did not experience&nbsp;
what Jung experienced as archetypes. I didn't have&nbsp;

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:24.600
the experience of wise old man, wise old woman,&nbsp;
things like this. It's not that I don't think&nbsp;

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:33.280
those exist. What I experienced was humanity as&nbsp;
a single organism, over and over and over again,&nbsp;

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:40.600
as a single organism, and that there&nbsp;
were metameridians within humanity that&nbsp;

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:47.840
wove all of our individual lives into&nbsp;
the life of the human species as a whole.&nbsp;

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:54.960
So I learned that our minds are woven into the&nbsp;
collective mind. They are aspects. They are seed&nbsp;

00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:00.640
crystals within the collective mind. Even our&nbsp;
bodies and the diseases that we have to manage&nbsp;

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:06.520
are all part of the body of humanity&nbsp;
evolving itself over long periods of time.&nbsp;

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:14.800
So it was archetypal in the sense of&nbsp;
trans-individual motifs within the human psyche,&nbsp;

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.600
but it wasn't quite the way Jung&nbsp;
conceptualized it. So basically,&nbsp;

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:27.560
archetypes in this way reflect the insight&nbsp;
that there are dominant structures that are&nbsp;

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:34.840
supra-personal. They go beyond the&nbsp;
functioning of individual beings,&nbsp;

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:43.680
and then in platonic sense, there are&nbsp;
metaphysical archetypes that basically inform&nbsp;

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:52.600
manifestation of time and space itself.
So at the causal level, you mentioned this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:58.360
where you connect with the divine intelligence,
what we perceive as God. I imagine there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:05.000
may be people listening wondering,
did you discover that there is a God? I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.520
generally tend not to like to use God language,
though I do. The reason I don't like to use God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:18.280
language is because as someone who knows the
history of world religions pretty well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:24.520
I also know all the theologies that have gone into
God language, and all the cultural limitations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:31.560
that go into it, and all the abuse that went into
it, and all the crimes and the horrible things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:37.520
that have been done in the name of God. And
certainly, I'm not talking about God in anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:43.720
like that. And so I would use the word the divine
instead of God, but that's really that's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:52.800
an end run, because even the concept of the divine
carries into it certain carryovers from our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:52.800 --> 00:56:00.960
time-space experience. And so on the one hand,
I want to affirm the idea that there is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:07.640
profound generative intelligence
manifesting as time and space,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:12.040
that time and space is not something&nbsp;
which is independent of the divine,&nbsp;

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:18.080
but it is a classic Hindu thinking, it is&nbsp;
the manifestation of the body of the divine.&nbsp;

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:26.240
So in that way, I want to affirm a&nbsp;
very wide vision of the divine, of God.&nbsp;

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:36.360
But because I've gone so deeply into the future,&nbsp;
and so deeply beyond space and time so many times,&nbsp;

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:43.880
my understanding or my feeling&nbsp;
for this cosmic principle,&nbsp;

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:50.840
I can't fit it inside the theologies of the&nbsp;
religions of the world. It's just it's much&nbsp;

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:59.240
larger than that. And so on the one hand, okay,&nbsp;
I can call it God, but then I have to qualify&nbsp;

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.320
that it's not this, it's not that, it's not what&nbsp;
you mean by God here, it's not what you mean by&nbsp;

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:10.840
God there. Right, like a lot of people think of,&nbsp;
at least in the monotheistic traditions, think of&nbsp;

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:19.040
individual or a being that were made in the form&nbsp;
of, right? And that's what I think people are&nbsp;

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:25.720
maybe curious about is what you discovered as&nbsp;
far as, you know, did you connect with a being or&nbsp;

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:33.080
beings or angels or other divine entities? And if&nbsp;
you could share a little bit about what that realm&nbsp;

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:40.600
was like. In all the years when I was doing this&nbsp;
work and all the work I did, I never encountered&nbsp;

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:48.640
a being, a divine beings that I'm God, you know,&nbsp;
this is what I am. It wasn't like that. It was&nbsp;

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:55.520
like, I would go deeper into a level of&nbsp;
consciousness and I would experience a communion&nbsp;

00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:01.000
with this consciousness. And this consciousness&nbsp;
would teach me, it knew me, it would teach me&nbsp;

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.200
and show me things and it would crush me and&nbsp;
then bring me forward into still deeper levels.&nbsp;

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:12.880
And I would go into those deeper levels and I&nbsp;
would enter into communion with those levels and&nbsp;

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:20.800
I internalized the energy of those&nbsp;
levels and I was with this consciousness.&nbsp;

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:28.280
But it never crystallized into a specific form. I&nbsp;
always felt its presence. It guided my sessions.&nbsp;

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.720
I could enter into dialogue with it. I&nbsp;
could enter into communion with it. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:37.440
would dissolve me into
itself. But it never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:43.400
crystallized into what you might call a&nbsp;
personality of God or a person of God.&nbsp;

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:50.800
And it just kept getting larger and larger,&nbsp;
deeper and deeper, more and more vast.&nbsp;

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:58.520
And I think that many of our theologies of God&nbsp;
or our thinking about God is really based upon&nbsp;

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.920
what I would call the early&nbsp;
encounters with an infinite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:10.960
intelligence. That this infinite intelligence
is far larger, far too large to ever be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:16.360
concretized in the historical&nbsp;
lineages that we recognize in&nbsp;

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:22.880
the world traditions. It's infinite in itself.&nbsp;
In fact, when I was in the deepest level of&nbsp;

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:28.520
consciousness that I ever went into when I was in&nbsp;
the diamond luminosity work, and that's the work&nbsp;

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:36.000
that occupied me for the last five years, when I&nbsp;
was as deep into the diamond luminosity as I had&nbsp;

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:43.520
ever entered and I was far beyond time-space&nbsp;
reality, I was dissolved into the luminous,&nbsp;

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:51.200
you might say the body of the divine, all of&nbsp;
a sudden my visual field turned 90 degrees,&nbsp;

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:59.720
a window opened up, and I saw reality far, far in&nbsp;
the distance. And I saw a light in that reality,&nbsp;

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.120
and a beam of light came out of that reality&nbsp;
and hit me. And I was in the diamond luminosity&nbsp;

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.600
condition. But this light was so powerful,&nbsp;
it shattered my mind. And it took me minutes&nbsp;

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:18.920
to recover from this. And that's when I began to&nbsp;
realize it's an infinite progression. The divine&nbsp;

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.960
is truly an infinite reality. Even using this&nbsp;
powerful method, I would never get to the end&nbsp;

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:32.640
of this reality. And that's one of the reasons&nbsp;
why I would be much gentler with myself if I were&nbsp;

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:37.880
doing this again today. Because I discovered,&nbsp;
see, when I began this work, I thought that the&nbsp;

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:44.840
purpose was to reach a state of consciousness, to&nbsp;
reach enlightenment, or to reach oneness with God,&nbsp;

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:51.840
or to dissolve into the primal void. And I had&nbsp;
known oneness with God at many different levels,&nbsp;

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:57.440
and I had entered into the primal void several&nbsp;
times, and I'd learned that there were different&nbsp;

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:05.400
depths of the primal void. And so now I began to&nbsp;
understand that it's not about getting to some&nbsp;

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:12.360
end state, which is going to magically transform&nbsp;
your life. It's a matter of opening up and letting&nbsp;

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:18.840
the love and intelligence of the universe or the&nbsp;
divine into you as much as you can bring it in,&nbsp;

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:25.160
as much as you can hold on to it, as much as&nbsp;
you can distill into the fabric of your living&nbsp;

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:32.760
existence, your earthly existence. It's not about&nbsp;
getting to some end point. It's about deepening&nbsp;

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:40.920
the ongoing communion that exists between&nbsp;
ourselves inside time and space and this larger&nbsp;

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:51.200
spiritual reality. Very beautiful. Can you&nbsp;
share more with us about the diamond luminosity?&nbsp;

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.080
Light surfaces many times in our psychedelic&nbsp;
work. I mean, every time you go through a death&nbsp;

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.240
rebirth experience, very&nbsp;
typically people encounter&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:05.800
the light, many forms of light. And I had
encountered this light at many different levels&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:12.640
along the journey. After I'd gone through ego
death, after I'd gone through the ocean of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.880
suffering work, after I'd gone through archetypal
reality, after I'd gone into the causal level&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:25.920
reality, about 15 years into my work, when I had
been given so many spiritual treasures, I felt&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:35.120
completely existentially satisfied. I mean, I just
I had been to experience radical Śūnyatā,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:43.840
emptiness of self, oneness of all existence
had been offered so many treasures. And then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.960
I went through yet another&nbsp;
cycle of death and rebirth.&nbsp;

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:55.840
And I accessed a level of light, a dimension&nbsp;
of light, that was so pure and so clear,&nbsp;

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:05.120
it absolutely stunned me. And it became my sole&nbsp;
objective in the rest of my psychedelic work&nbsp;

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:12.960
to return to this reality. Because once you&nbsp;
touch what I'm calling the diamond luminosity,&nbsp;

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:19.120
once you touch it, it's a reality which is so&nbsp;
far beyond anything that I had ever touched in&nbsp;

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.960
any of my earlier work, that I just lost interest&nbsp;
in archetypal reality, I lost interest in causal&nbsp;

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:34.760
reality, I wanted to get back into this level of&nbsp;
reality. It's so pure, it's just breathtakingly&nbsp;

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:44.360
magnificently pure, and the levels of ecstasy&nbsp;
associated with it are just staggering. And in&nbsp;

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:52.360
the next five years of work, in 26 sessions,&nbsp;
which is one third of my entire journey, I only&nbsp;

01:03:52.360 --> 01:04:01.200
got access to this level of reality four times.&nbsp;
So in between those four sessions were lots of&nbsp;

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:06.960
purification, more purification at a very&nbsp;
deep level, more learning, more teaching,&nbsp;

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:14.320
but accessing this reality four times. And&nbsp;
I think as I look at the world's literature,&nbsp;

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:20.600
the spiritual literature, and Buddhist literature&nbsp;
is probably the tradition that I know the best,&nbsp;

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.560
they call this level of reality Dharmakāya,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.600
the clear light of absolute&nbsp;
reality. So it is considered&nbsp;

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:38.360
in their tradition, the absolute foundational&nbsp;
reality of time and space, all time and space&nbsp;

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:45.440
reality, all the galaxies, all the big bang emerge&nbsp;
out of this crystalline light, which is a pre&nbsp;

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.000
samsaric, it's what we would&nbsp;
call an extra samsaric reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.600
It's outside of the cycle of space and
time. So it's outside of physical reality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:54.600 --> 01:05:04.600
and it's also outside of the bardos of postmortem
existence. It's outside of the entire system. Once&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:12.200
you touch it, you're hopelessly in love with it
for the rest of your life. It just is something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:20.080
that illumines everything. I understood what
Buddhist meant when they said, touch it once,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.840
it can undo hundreds of years of living in the
shadows of karma. Because it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:30.720
such a penetrating transformative&nbsp;
effect, impact, that just to touch&nbsp;

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:37.000
it, it changes your whole understanding of&nbsp;
existence, and your whole experience of what&nbsp;

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:46.400
it means to be alive. Is this also what&nbsp;
you refer to in your book as the beloved?&nbsp;

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:53.320
Well, you know, everybody has to find a word to&nbsp;
describe this transcendent reality. We can talk&nbsp;

01:05:53.320 --> 01:06:01.400
about God, or we can talk about the divine. Some&nbsp;
people call it the absolute. Daoism calls it the&nbsp;

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:09.840
eternal Dao. Jewish mysticism calls it the Ein&nbsp;
Sof, the great nothingness, the great emptiness.&nbsp;

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:18.760
I call it my beloved, because in a path of&nbsp;
temporary immersion, you move into intimacy&nbsp;

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:24.920
with this reality, and then you come back out of&nbsp;
it. And then you move into intimacy, and you come&nbsp;

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:30.520
back out of it, and it becomes like a love&nbsp;
relationship. But it's a love relationship&nbsp;

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:37.520
which actually dissolves the bodies of the two&nbsp;
different beings. The communion that arises is&nbsp;

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:44.440
it's a deep and profound spiritual communion. And&nbsp;
so I just adopted the vocabulary that felt most&nbsp;

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:52.240
natural to me, and I called it my beloved, the&nbsp;
beloved. And so yes, to me, the beloved manifests&nbsp;

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.360
itself at all sorts of different levels.&nbsp;
It's manifesting itself at the early level,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.520
early stages,
the middle stages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:05.560
and the advanced stages. But in the end,&nbsp;
you recognize that you're always in dialogue&nbsp;

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:11.880
with this profound creative intelligence, which&nbsp;
interestingly enough feels more like a she,&nbsp;

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:21.880
in my experience, than a he. And I associate the&nbsp;
feminine side of God with the act of creation.&nbsp;

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:29.560
And what you might think of as the masculine side&nbsp;
of God, as the radically transcendent aspect of&nbsp;

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:36.800
the basic idea is that the primal one divides&nbsp;
into two. One stays outside of space-time,&nbsp;

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:42.960
the other manifests space and time, and&nbsp;
manifests all life within space and time.&nbsp;

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:51.600
So for me, the beloved is more the feminine&nbsp;
side of the divine, the divine mother.&nbsp;

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:58.920
Yes, it seems that light is a theme in your&nbsp;
experiences. And also, how much of a role&nbsp;

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:05.880
did or does love play in&nbsp;
these experiences for you?&nbsp;

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:14.720
It played, eventually, a very large&nbsp;
role. There were some sessions in which I&nbsp;

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:23.040
encountered or was blessed with experiences of&nbsp;
cosmic love. And it's love not like anything I'd&nbsp;

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:30.160
ever experienced before. It just absolutely&nbsp;
shatters me and overwhelmed me. I experienced&nbsp;

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:38.840
that all of existence was generated not out of&nbsp;
simply a sheer power. Can you think of the power&nbsp;

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:44.920
of the Big Bang and everything that emerged&nbsp;
from it? Not only the intelligence there,&nbsp;

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:52.600
but that love, a profound cosmic love,&nbsp;
why is it the very act of creation itself?&nbsp;

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:58.040
And that's obviously a kind of love that's not&nbsp;
like anything that we know in human parlance.&nbsp;

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:07.840
It's not anything nearly that small. But it&nbsp;
is the fiber of the divine itself. And I think&nbsp;

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:16.440
as love and oneness are kind of two&nbsp;
different sides of the reality. Because&nbsp;

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:24.440
love, if the world is truly one, if it's all one,&nbsp;
love is the emotion of this oneness. Love is the&nbsp;

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:31.640
fact of oneness asserting itself in a world of&nbsp;
duality. Yeah, love has been really important,&nbsp;

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:39.880
which really surprised me because of the four&nbsp;
yogas in Hinduism, Jñāna, the path of the mind,&nbsp;

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:48.880
Rāja, the path of meditation, Karma yoga, Bhakti&nbsp;
yoga, Bhakti yoga, the yoga of loving devotion.&nbsp;

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.240
It's a form of yoga that I identified with the&nbsp;
least. I've always been more intellectually&nbsp;

01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:01.640
oriented, meditatively oriented, not Bhakti&nbsp;
oriented. And yet I began to have a series of&nbsp;

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:12.840
very profound Bhakti experiences that it's kind&nbsp;
of what led me to talk about the beloved in this&nbsp;

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:22.120
very lover kind of context. How much&nbsp;
is love the fabric of the divine?&nbsp;

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:30.280
Anything I say at this point, I mean, first&nbsp;
of all, please forgive my hubris at daring to&nbsp;

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:36.760
describe the nature of the divine. I mean,&nbsp;
come on, get real. I mean, this is just like...&nbsp;

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:43.760
So anything I say is going to be totally&nbsp;
inadequate to the reality itself. So we&nbsp;

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:53.520
describe the divine nature as infinite&nbsp;
knowledge, infinite power, infinite love.&nbsp;

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.000
All of those are equally true, and I'm&nbsp;
sure that there are other qualities&nbsp;

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.320
which we want to add to that.&nbsp;
But let's start with those three.&nbsp;

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:14.760
The challenge, I think, of understanding
the love aspect of the divine is because life as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:25.240
we experience it is an often dirty, nasty, mean,
cruel thing. And so any suggestion that somehow&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.840
the world as we know it with all of its&nbsp;

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:39.960
pain and suffering is somehow a manifestation of a&nbsp;
supremely loving consciousness, it's horrendously&nbsp;

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:47.040
difficult to reconcile those. And I understand&nbsp;
that. I mean, as a philosopher of religion,&nbsp;

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:54.120
I understand the challenge. And I think the only&nbsp;
way of overcoming that challenge is to really&nbsp;

01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:00.040
understand the deep structure or the deep&nbsp;
intentionality that's manifesting itself&nbsp;

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:06.240
in the creation itself, in our evolving&nbsp;
universe, in the project of the universe.&nbsp;

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:14.080
You have to radically expand your time horizon to&nbsp;
understand what's taking place here. You have to&nbsp;

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:22.560
understand that the human condition as we&nbsp;
currently know it is just a small dot in a long&nbsp;

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:29.560
developmental process that not only has been&nbsp;
going on for 13.7 billion years, but will continue&nbsp;

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:37.920
to go on for 13.7 plus more years. So that, as&nbsp;
Sri Aurobindo said, we are a transitional species.&nbsp;

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:46.600
We are actualizing ourselves within a long&nbsp;
developmental trajectory. And if we think that,&nbsp;

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:53.560
well, God must not be real because we could&nbsp;
have done a better job creating the universe.&nbsp;

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.640
If I had infinite power, I could have certainly&nbsp;
created a better universe than this where children&nbsp;

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:05.680
die and all the terrible things that happen to&nbsp;
us. But that assumes that we know what the divine&nbsp;

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:12.920
intention is, what the project of existence is.&nbsp;
And I think we are like children in a playpen.&nbsp;

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:19.400
We are just beginning to get a grip on the&nbsp;
enormity of the project of existence. We're&nbsp;

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:25.200
just beginning, really since Hubble, in modern&nbsp;
theories of cosmology, beginning to understand&nbsp;

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:31.000
the size and depth and textures. I think&nbsp;
psychedelics are kind of like the Hubble&nbsp;

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:38.680
of psychological insight. They are giving us an&nbsp;
experience of the depth in which consciousness&nbsp;

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:47.520
exists. But that just gets us at the beginning&nbsp;
of beginning to comprehend what is the project.&nbsp;

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:54.760
What will humanity be five billion years from&nbsp;
now? What will we be a million years from now,&nbsp;

01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:02.520
or even a hundred thousand years from now?&nbsp;
The divine seems to think on that scale.&nbsp;

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:09.000
So we have to radically stretch&nbsp;
ourselves to think on that scale.&nbsp;

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.320
So the problem of suffering really challenges&nbsp;
our understanding of the role of love,&nbsp;

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:25.360
the principle of love in the divine nature. But&nbsp;
once we have an experiential access to some of&nbsp;

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:35.560
the deeper trajectories of the divine&nbsp;
intent, then things begin to make more sense.&nbsp;

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:43.080
I think the divine is creating a masterpiece.&nbsp;
I mean, I think refined, elevated,&nbsp;

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:51.520
potentiated human experience is a masterpiece&nbsp;
of creation that takes thousands, thousands,&nbsp;

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.800
millions of years, billions of years&nbsp;
to orchestrate and to bring forward,&nbsp;

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:04.280
especially since it's not done. We intentionally&nbsp;
cooperate and participate in this creative&nbsp;

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:08.680
process. It's not being done to us. It's&nbsp;
something we are carrying forward in the very&nbsp;

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:17.560
fiber of our being. But we really have&nbsp;
to kind of grasp the scale of things&nbsp;

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:25.840
to even understand our present circumstances.
At the same time, it sounds like you found that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:32.800
the Atman is Brahman, that you found that we are
part of the divine and the divine is part of us.&nbsp;

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:43.040
Yeah. And really, there's very little that's&nbsp;
new in any of the experiences that I lay out.&nbsp;

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:50.080
The vision of reality, the cosmology that emerges&nbsp;
out of psychedelic work is fundamentally the same&nbsp;

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:56.480
as the cosmology that emerges out of deep mystical&nbsp;
spiritual traditions in the very highest and most&nbsp;

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:03.120
refined levels of spiritual traditions in the&nbsp;
world. It's not that we're bringing something&nbsp;

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.800
new to the table, maybe a little bit, but we're&nbsp;
not bringing a whole lot of new to the table.&nbsp;

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:15.400
What we have is a different protocol, a different&nbsp;
strategy for accessing these very deep levels of&nbsp;

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:21.240
reality, which yield deep insights into the&nbsp;
structure of existence. But you will find&nbsp;

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:30.680
the same fundamental cosmology emerging out of&nbsp;
the great spiritual traditions of the world.&nbsp;

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.600
Since you brought up the&nbsp;
Hubble telescope, and we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:43.480
primarily been talking about what we consider
just another word as consciousness, what did you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.720
discover in our universe, what we consider
as sort of the physical universe, what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:55.120
consider as space or outer space?
Did you traverse that aspect of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:03.440
experience in your sessions?
I wasn't taken into journeys&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:12.480
into our galaxy or journeys into other galaxies.
That just wasn't part of the work for me. Other&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:21.640
people may have those experiences or have had
those experiences. So while I was given this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:26.600
particular session called the cosmic tour,
I called it the cosmic tour, where I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.880
taken on this cosmic tour&nbsp;
and shown so many things,&nbsp;

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:37.960
much of which I could not reproduce when I&nbsp;
came back into my time-space consciousness,&nbsp;

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:44.840
because my time-space consciousness just did&nbsp;
not have the vocabulary, the intellectual tools&nbsp;

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:51.760
to articulate those. That's why I've often wished&nbsp;
that I had a PhD in physics and astrophysics,&nbsp;

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.680
that I would better be able to articulate&nbsp;
some of the experiences that I was given.&nbsp;

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:02.840
But I didn't spend a lot of time traveling&nbsp;
within time and space. It was more a matter of&nbsp;

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:10.640
going underneath time and space and getting into&nbsp;
the underlying deep structure that informs time&nbsp;

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:19.800
and space and our experience in time and space.&nbsp;
I feel like I recall in your book that you were&nbsp;

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:26.040
shown that the universe, I think you've already&nbsp;
said this, goes on and on essentially. Is that&nbsp;

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:32.040
right? Do I recall that correctly? Yeah.&nbsp;
Basically, there are two different models&nbsp;

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:38.320
of the universe. One is that it'll keep expanding&nbsp;
forever. And the other is that we reach a point&nbsp;

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:44.440
where there's a maximum expansion, and then&nbsp;
it begins a contraction. So is it a pulsating&nbsp;

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:49.800
universe, expanding and contracting, and then&nbsp;
re-expanding? Or is it an infinitely expanding&nbsp;

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:56.720
universe? I don't really have an&nbsp;
answer to that particular question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:01.840
but clearly the universe is
just, it's on a tear. It's on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.480
a tear. It's going on for billions&nbsp;
and billions and billions of years.&nbsp;

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:13.680
Now, that's a deflating insight if you think that&nbsp;
a human being is simply a 100-year-old being.&nbsp;

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:18.560
If we're simply a 100-year-old being, then we're&nbsp;
basically sand on the beach beside the ocean. We&nbsp;

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:25.040
don't really get to participate in that deep&nbsp;
future. But if reincarnation is true, and I think&nbsp;

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:31.240
there's plenty of factual evidence that it's true,&nbsp;
if reincarnation is true, and if it's true that&nbsp;

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:38.240
our essence is indestructible, and that we take&nbsp;
everything that we've learned and roll it over&nbsp;

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:45.000
to continue learning over thousands and thousands&nbsp;
and millions of years, then we get to actually&nbsp;

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.960
participate in this divine unfolding. It's not&nbsp;
somebody else's future or some other future,&nbsp;

01:19:51.960 --> 01:20:03.380
but it's our future. We are co-participants,&nbsp;
eternal participants in this eternal process.&nbsp;

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:10.280
Mm-hmm. In your experiences, you talked&nbsp;
about the birth of the future human.&nbsp;

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.960
Yeah. Can you shed a little&nbsp;
light on what that is about?&nbsp;

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:20.440
Yeah. Yeah, there's a chapter in the book&nbsp;
called The Birth of the Future Human,&nbsp;

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.360
and I really think this is maybe the&nbsp;
most important chapter of the book,&nbsp;

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:28.080
and it's also the one that&nbsp;
caught me completely by surprise.&nbsp;

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:35.240
I wasn't expecting anything like this in my&nbsp;
journey. I thought first it was a personal&nbsp;

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:39.640
journey about personal healing,&nbsp;
personal awakening. Then when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:48.160
that expanded, I still thought, okay,
it's a journey about an individual being given&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:56.160
experiences that provide insight into the deep
structure underlying our lives. But then about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:04.360
halfway through my work, starting in around 1990
and continuing through 1995, I began to be given a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:10.640
series of visions that were internally consistent,
that were dropped into my sessions talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:16.760
about humanity's evolutionary destiny,
where humanity was in its evolutionary&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.040
journey, that we were coming into a&nbsp;
turning point in history, that we were&nbsp;

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:28.320
coming into a culmination, a crescendo of the&nbsp;
evolutionary journey that was going to catalyze&nbsp;

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:36.400
a transformation inside humanity that would&nbsp;
mark a true before and after moment in time.&nbsp;

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:44.960
There was a profound spiritual transformation&nbsp;
that was coming to a crescendo, coming to a head,&nbsp;

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:49.640
and this kept repeating itself&nbsp;
in my work in different ways.&nbsp;

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:57.960
But I did not know how the universe was ever&nbsp;
going to pull this off. It didn't show me how&nbsp;

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:04.000
it was going to happen. Then about a year and&nbsp;
a half later, when I was in the middle of the&nbsp;

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.040
diamond luminosity work, so I was working&nbsp;
at a very deep level, in one particular day,&nbsp;

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:20.440
I was given an experience taken far into&nbsp;
the future. I had died and dissolved into&nbsp;

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:25.640
the human psyche. So when I say I was taken&nbsp;
into the future, it's not so much that Chris&nbsp;

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:33.000
Bache was taken into the future. It's like, as&nbsp;
the human family, I experienced the human family&nbsp;

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:40.360
in a trans-temporal dimension of&nbsp;
time, in a time-expanded state,&nbsp;

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:46.880
and I experienced in an accelerated way the&nbsp;
death and rebirth of the entire human family.&nbsp;

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:55.920
I experienced a profound geopolitical crisis that&nbsp;
seemed to be being seeded by a cascading series of&nbsp;

01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:04.520
ecological crises, but I experienced some type&nbsp;
of fundamental loss of control, an unraveling of&nbsp;

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:12.880
life at the basic level, a tremendous global&nbsp;
crisis that was so deep and so profound that no&nbsp;

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.640
one was going to be able to isolate&nbsp;
themselves or protect themselves from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:20.800
it. It was a crisis so deep
it was going to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:28.320
humanity to our collective knees.
But just when the crisis reached its peak,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:34.400
I experienced that we moved through it, and then
there was the beginning of a lightning. We made it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:43.120
through this crisis, and when we began to pick
ourselves up in this post-crisis period of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:46.760
history, we've discovered&nbsp;
that we had been profoundly&nbsp;

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:54.440
changed. Something happened in this crisis that&nbsp;
opened us up, changed us at the very center of&nbsp;

01:23:54.440 --> 01:24:00.960
our being. One way of talking about it is that&nbsp;
there was a birth of oneness, that oneness,&nbsp;

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:07.520
instead of being a private mystical experience&nbsp;
of a very select few, oneness was born within the&nbsp;

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:21.000
human psyche as a whole. We tapped into a certain&nbsp;
depth of our nature that allowed us to become,&nbsp;

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
first of all, it allowed us to become no&nbsp;
longer enemies with all of the human beings,&nbsp;

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.840
all the divisions of history that have been used&nbsp;
to justify differences of race, differences of&nbsp;

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:37.960
class structure, differences of religion, all&nbsp;
those differences which we think of and have used&nbsp;

01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:44.120
to divide history, national identity, all those&nbsp;
were dissolved, all those were transcended,&nbsp;

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:50.640
and we began to experience a fundamental&nbsp;
oneness at the core of our life and all life&nbsp;

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:59.640
itself. This led to creativity began to reinforce&nbsp;
itself, and we began to create new social forms,&nbsp;

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:07.200
new structures. Eventually, over time, I&nbsp;
came to understand that what this was about&nbsp;

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.680
was that there was a pressure building&nbsp;
up within the collective psyche,&nbsp;

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:18.160
and that this pressure was taking humanity&nbsp;
through a collective death-rebirth process&nbsp;

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:25.640
that represented a fundamental irreversible shift&nbsp;
in the collective psyche. I think of it as a shift&nbsp;

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:33.560
in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche so&nbsp;
that any child born after we make this transition&nbsp;

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:39.760
will be operating within a psychic field which&nbsp;
is fundamentally different, more elevated,&nbsp;

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.160
more spiritually informed&nbsp;
than we are operating out&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.560
of now or we've been operating out of the past.&nbsp;

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:54.000
This isn't simply a crisis with economic&nbsp;
ramifications or industrial ramifications&nbsp;

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.760
or political or civic ramifications. It's&nbsp;
a revolution in the fundamental structure&nbsp;

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:07.320
of the human psyche. It's a revolution in our&nbsp;
human nature. Now, I think that we have entered&nbsp;

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.480
this period, this process. I think we're in&nbsp;
the very early stages of it. We're just getting&nbsp;

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.440
started on it. I think the&nbsp;
21st century will be pivotal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:23.960
in going through this transformative crisis.
I wasn't given a lot of details on names, dates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:29.640
and places and stuff like that. What I was given
was this core experience of what it's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:33.400
to feel like for the human&nbsp;
family when they go through&nbsp;

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:40.600
a collective dark night of the soul, go through&nbsp;
a collective ordeal that eventually will awaken&nbsp;

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:48.040
an underlying revolution in the human psyche,&nbsp;
a spiritual opening of the human psyche.&nbsp;

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:54.280
Now, I'm not alone. This is nothing unique to me.&nbsp;
This is an insight that many spiritual teachers&nbsp;

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.520
have had, many indigenous people&nbsp;
have had. Many psychedelicists&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:03.520
have tapped into this understanding.
I think this is the flow of history underneath&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:10.240
us that we can tap into in different ways. I think
many of the spiritual mystical traditions&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.960
have tapped into and begin to&nbsp;
understand some of this dynamic,&nbsp;

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.520
but I think we're coming into a century&nbsp;
where we are at a critical turning point.&nbsp;

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.400
I really believe that the 21st century is&nbsp;
pivotal here because if we just look at the&nbsp;

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:37.400
scientific data on the ecological crisis,&nbsp;
if we look at what is now an increasingly&nbsp;

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:43.120
shared understanding of the depth of&nbsp;
ecological disruption that we're going into&nbsp;

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:50.320
and the change of interrupting. Well, I won't&nbsp;
go into the scientific material but clearly&nbsp;

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:56.440
we cannot continue on earth operating the&nbsp;
way that we had been operating in the past.&nbsp;

01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:03.800
We don't have enough resources. Inequality is&nbsp;
just too extreme. I don't think we can continue&nbsp;

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:12.480
to govern the earth out of the psychological&nbsp;
structure of the ego. The ego is fundamentally&nbsp;

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:18.760
a divided psychic structure. I think the ego&nbsp;
is a beautiful thing. It's a magnificent thing&nbsp;

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.880
but it fundamentally is cut off from the core of&nbsp;
existence, the foundation of existence and each&nbsp;

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:32.880
other. We need to evolve into a higher level of&nbsp;
consciousness which is post-egoic in order to&nbsp;

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:41.760
have the wisdom to rise to the challenges that&nbsp;
the ego has created for humanity over its last&nbsp;

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:47.800
1000 year history. And I think we will. I think&nbsp;
we will come through this crisis. I think we're&nbsp;

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:54.560
going to go through unbelievable suffering in&nbsp;
the centuries ahead but I do believe that we come&nbsp;

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:59.840
through it because that at least has been the&nbsp;
nature of my experience. We do come through this&nbsp;

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:05.960
and humanity does make this evolutionary pivot.&nbsp;
Well, I know there's more you can share about&nbsp;

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:12.760
this topic and I think we'll do a whole other&nbsp;
conversation about the birth of a future human&nbsp;

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:21.440
and also we want to talk more about reincarnation.&nbsp;
Can you share why you stopped these LSD sessions&nbsp;

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:29.280
in 1999? Well, I talk about this in the book&nbsp;
in the last chapter coming off the mountain&nbsp;

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:36.760
and I basically boil it down to two reasons,&nbsp;
pain and heartache. My subtle energy system,&nbsp;

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:42.760
psychedelic states open you up to huge flows of&nbsp;
energy. You're taking in enormous flows of energy.&nbsp;

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:48.360
It takes years and years to manage the flows&nbsp;
of energy and I basically realized that I was&nbsp;

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:58.200
running so hot that even months after my session&nbsp;
was over, I was permanently uncomfortable in my&nbsp;

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:04.000
body because of the quantity of energy that was&nbsp;
running in my subtle energy system, my chi system&nbsp;

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.640
or my prana. So that was telling me that it was&nbsp;
time to let my body calm down and let that subtle&nbsp;

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:20.320
energy system find a new equilibrium point. But&nbsp;
the main reason I stopped was because of heartache&nbsp;

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:28.880
because once you dissolve into the divine light,&nbsp;
once you dissolve into diamond luminosity and&nbsp;

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:35.160
dissolve into the crystalline nature of&nbsp;
consciousness at this very, very deep level,&nbsp;

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:45.520
coming back into time and space is just difficult.&nbsp;
It's very hard. You lose your zest for living&nbsp;

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:52.640
inside time and space when you know how much more&nbsp;
is available to you outside of time and space.&nbsp;

01:30:52.640 --> 01:31:00.640
And going into and coming out of and going into&nbsp;
and coming out of this just became too painful.&nbsp;

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:08.200
And so eventually my beloved and I came&nbsp;
to an agreement that I would not return&nbsp;

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:13.960
to these states of consciousness&nbsp;
until I could stay with her forever.&nbsp;

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:19.440
And that's really what lies behind&nbsp;
my stopping. I just had to stop&nbsp;

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:27.400
and for the rest of my life focus on internalizing&nbsp;
the gifts that I had already been given&nbsp;

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.600
rather than trying to acquire&nbsp;
or be given more gifts.&nbsp;

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:39.640
You've been in communication with Stanislav Grof&nbsp;
and Ralph Metzner who are pioneers in this area&nbsp;

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:45.440
of psychedelics and psychological&nbsp;
consciousness, cosmic exploration.&nbsp;

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:52.920
Have you shared your experiences with them&nbsp;
and what have they shared with you about that?&nbsp;

01:31:52.920 --> 01:32:01.200
I've been in dialogue with both of them and I have&nbsp;
shared my sessions with Stan and he quotes from&nbsp;

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:07.680
some of my sessions scattered throughout his&nbsp;
books. Some of them are anonymous and in some&nbsp;

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:18.520
later works they're identified as mine.&nbsp;
And Stan very graciously wrote a beautiful&nbsp;

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:26.000
forward to my book Dark Night Early Dawn which&nbsp;
was my first major book on psychedelic work,&nbsp;

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:34.240
psychedelic theory. I think that there's a&nbsp;
fundamental, I mean we have different projects,&nbsp;

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:40.480
different agendas. I mean Stan is a therapist,&nbsp;
he's a world healer. He has worked with thousands&nbsp;

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:47.120
of individuals and collected thousands and&nbsp;
thousands of session experiences and organized&nbsp;

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:53.120
them into an understanding&nbsp;
of the vast scope of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:56.160
landscape that one experiences in these states.&nbsp;

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:01.800
My work has been different. I've really been&nbsp;
doing an individual journey penetrating deeper&nbsp;

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:07.120
and deeper into the universe. So I see&nbsp;
our work as complementary in that way.&nbsp;

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:14.840
But yeah, I've been in dialogue with both&nbsp;
of them. Yeah, I love them both very dearly.&nbsp;

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:22.000
Ralph has now transitioned on. I love them dearly.&nbsp;
We've been in dialogue. Ralph gave me feedback&nbsp;

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.200
on LSD and the Mind of the Universe before I&nbsp;
published it. So yeah, I consider them close&nbsp;

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:35.680
colleagues and good friends. So they were&nbsp;
supportive of your process? Yes, yeah.&nbsp;

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:42.840
That's wonderful. The last area I want to touch&nbsp;
on with you is that of course people listening,&nbsp;

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:49.040
some may think, well how much can we trust&nbsp;
these experiences? And I know that you had a&nbsp;

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:53.720
conversation or an interaction with Kenneth&nbsp;
Ring who is the co-founder of the International&nbsp;

01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:00.720
Association for Near Death Studies. I was&nbsp;
wondering if you could share a little bit about&nbsp;

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:08.280
your correspondence with him or what you have to&nbsp;
say about how much we can trust your experiences?&nbsp;

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:13.360
Yeah, that's a really important question. I&nbsp;
mean, how do we know that we aren't simply&nbsp;

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:17.760
exploring some hidden corner of my&nbsp;
personal unconscious or even some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.640
hidden corner of the collective psyche, I&nbsp;
mean, I know I understand how radical the&nbsp;

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:30.200
assertions that I'm making, making them sound&nbsp;
almost cavalier. How do we know that we can trust&nbsp;

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:37.040
these experiences to be what I'm suggesting that&nbsp;
they are? And Ken Ring and I had a dialogue about&nbsp;

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:44.400
this. Ken is a wonderful scholar and he's a good&nbsp;
friend. And so after he had read LSD and the Mind&nbsp;

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:53.000
of the Universe, he wrote me and we went back and&nbsp;
forth around precisely this issue. How trustable&nbsp;

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.240
are these deep psychedelic experiences? How&nbsp;
do we know that they're not better understood&nbsp;

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:04.400
as a manifestation of something coming out of&nbsp;
the personal psyche or the collective psyche,&nbsp;

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:09.760
that they really have these metaphysical&nbsp;
ontological ramifications that I've been&nbsp;

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:15.200
interpreting them to have? And so he and I went&nbsp;
back and forth in an exchange of letters about&nbsp;

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.840
this. And Ken worked me over pretty hard. I mean,&nbsp;
he was asking hard questions and I loved it. And&nbsp;

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.200
this was a dialogue that was&nbsp;
worth sharing. So we wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:35.080
it up in an essay called Are Deep Psychedelic
Experiences Trustable? And we published it online&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:41.960
and it's available. If you just Google that title,
you'll find it. And in it, I try to address&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:49.400
that specific issue. And I also bring in
other people's experiences which provide&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:55.800
levels of objective verification, because
many psychedelic experiences lead us&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:01.000
to have experiences that can be verified
because they relate to something inside time&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:09.600
and space. The deeper cosmological experiences
cannot be verified in that way, but the existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:16.080
of verifiable experiences when they refer to time
and space reality certainly points to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:20.960
credibility of the deeper&nbsp;
cosmological experiences.&nbsp;

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:28.520
So I bring in a lot of evidence in the footnotes&nbsp;
and in the literature that speak to the issue&nbsp;

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:37.080
of the trustability of these experiences. I&nbsp;
think most of our doubt about their trustability&nbsp;

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:44.320
is completely understandable, but I think it comes&nbsp;
from, first, not having personal experience of&nbsp;

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:51.560
these states and trying to understand them within&nbsp;
a metaphysical framework that's based upon time&nbsp;

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:58.200
of physical sensation experience, mental&nbsp;
experience, sensate experience. We're trying to&nbsp;

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:05.160
understand these things within a framework&nbsp;
which is smaller than we want they need to be.&nbsp;

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:12.440
It's just like we had to have tens of thousands&nbsp;
of near-death episodes in print and published&nbsp;

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:17.560
before the medical community began to take them&nbsp;
seriously because they didn't want to interpret&nbsp;

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:23.280
these as an indication of the existence of&nbsp;
spiritual reality. They wanted to interpret it&nbsp;

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.080
as something going on inside&nbsp;
the physical process. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:33.560
think that's true for psychedelic experiences
too. We need to develop a more sophisticated&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:39.600
ontology, metaphysical understanding,
even to have a framework for understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:46.320
some of these experiences. And this is why
I didn't rush into print on any of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:53.640
experiences. I mean, after I stopped my work in
99, I really spent 20 years digesting them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:53.640 --> 01:38:00.040
analyzing, looking at other people's experiences,
looking at the other metaphysical systems, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:06.160
trying to put all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle
together before I published LSD in the Mind of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:12.320
Universe. So a lot of thought, it's not simply,
here's my experience, you can trust it because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:20.160
had it. It's not that at all. What we really want
is not just one person's experiences, but we want&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:26.640
to have a critical protocol which involves
many people's experiences, putting all of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:32.720
experiences on the table and finding out which
of these experiences are idiosyncratic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.600
and which one of them are common ground.
We haven't really begun that work yet. We're in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:44.080
the early stages of doing that. But psychedelics
are not going to go away. We're going to be using&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:52.840
them for decades and hundreds of years to come.
And this challenge of collective verification&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:59.560
of the visions that emerge in these states
is just getting started, is just moving forward.&nbsp;

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:03.600
It sounds like you're suggesting that&nbsp;
we need more research in this area,&nbsp;

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:09.680
which can be tricky because of the taboo and&nbsp;
the legalities around it. Although it seems that&nbsp;

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:16.640
with other studies on psilocybin and other&nbsp;
psychedelics that maybe that's beginning to&nbsp;

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:25.960
shift. I think it is beginning to shift. I think&nbsp;
what's happening is the psychedelic community&nbsp;

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:33.320
is demonstrating with increasing convincing&nbsp;
research that these substances have a tremendous&nbsp;

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:40.640
power to heal. And that's what's bringing them&nbsp;
back into public discussion. We're going to find&nbsp;

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:47.560
over time that the same amplifying qualities&nbsp;
which allow them to have a therapeutic impact&nbsp;

01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:53.760
continue. If we continue to apply these&nbsp;
methodologies, they continue to open up&nbsp;

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:59.680
deeper and deeper levels of consciousness. And&nbsp;
when we get deep enough, eventually we'll begin&nbsp;

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:08.320
to harvest the philosophical and cosmological&nbsp;
significance of these substances. I gave a talk&nbsp;

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:15.000
at the Erotas Conference at Oxford last fall,&nbsp;
and I called it Seizing the Philosophical and&nbsp;

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:21.760
Cosmological Significance of Psychedelics. We're&nbsp;
not there yet, but I think we're going there.&nbsp;

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:28.800
We will get there to move in this direction.&nbsp;
Well, Chris, I know this is a very large topic,&nbsp;

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.240
and I just want to ask this last question,&nbsp;
and I'm excited we're going to have another&nbsp;

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:40.680
conversation. Is there anything you want to share&nbsp;
more today about psychedelics and the cosmic mind?&nbsp;

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:47.840
I want to return again to the cautionary&nbsp;
words that we shared in the very beginning.&nbsp;

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:56.160
This is deep, challenging, demanding work. You&nbsp;
do not try to climb Mount Everest unless you have&nbsp;

01:40:56.160 --> 01:41:01.440
all the best equipment and all the best guides&nbsp;
going with you. You do not want to go deep into&nbsp;

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:08.000
the psyche unless you have all the best equipment&nbsp;
and the best context for doing this type of work.&nbsp;

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:14.920
So I want to affirm that. I want to affirm&nbsp;
the importance of a rigorous protocol.&nbsp;

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:21.320
If you want to go deep, you have to have a&nbsp;
particularly rigorous protocol, first just&nbsp;

01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:28.920
to survive the encounter, but also to take&nbsp;
experiences and distill them into increasingly&nbsp;

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:39.560
clear, clear, articulate experiences that are&nbsp;
not lost. Your mind just doesn't swallow them up.&nbsp;

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.800
You can really bring back the core of the&nbsp;
experience. Once you do that, once you've taken&nbsp;

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:50.840
all the cautions, all the precautions, and once&nbsp;
you have spent time doing your due diligence in&nbsp;

01:41:50.840 --> 01:42:00.440
this, then I think we are at the cusp of&nbsp;
a completely new chapter in philosophy of&nbsp;

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:07.120
consciousness, a new chapter in our understanding&nbsp;
what is happening in existence. Why is human&nbsp;

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:13.200
existence the way it is? Why is existence the way&nbsp;
it is? What's going on underneath the surface?&nbsp;

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:18.840
What is the nature of the intelligence&nbsp;
that's manifesting the body of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:23.600
universe? What is the nature of the
intelligence manifesting inside&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.120
our own hearts and mind over time?&nbsp;
This, I think, is the beginning&nbsp;

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:36.000
of a whole new chapter of philosophical and&nbsp;
spiritual reflection. In conclusion, I just&nbsp;

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:44.160
want to leave with your viewers a sense of&nbsp;
excitement or this tremendous turning point&nbsp;

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:52.560
that we are at, this pivot point of this profound&nbsp;
deepening of our understanding of our experience&nbsp;

01:42:52.560 --> 01:43:00.120
of these deep structures of reality and a&nbsp;
deepening of our understanding of what's taking&nbsp;

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:06.320
place behind the scenes and the opportunity&nbsp;
to enter into conscious communion with the&nbsp;

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:14.640
of our existence, which was previously maybe&nbsp;
just the privileged domain of very, very advanced&nbsp;

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:22.120
meditative and contemplative mystics, but now&nbsp;
we have a new modality that allows even ordinary&nbsp;

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:29.280
human beings to have just a touch taste of&nbsp;
these experiences, which can be life-changing.&nbsp;

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:34.200
And for people to know the risks and the benefits,&nbsp;
right? Because each person might have a different&nbsp;

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:41.080
reaction or response to these kinds of&nbsp;
substances. Yeah, there are screening criteria&nbsp;

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:48.560
and more important, more criteria that&nbsp;
would be… which are used in order to&nbsp;

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:53.040
make sure people who do this&nbsp;
work are safe and only people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:53.720 --> 01:44:00.120
should do this work do do this work.
Chris, thank you so much for being with me today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:06.880
Thank you so much for going beyond the beyond and
bringing it back for all of us. I really have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:12.760
enjoyed our conversation and I look forward to
our next one. Thank you, Emmy. I have enjoyed our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.640
conversation too. Thank you for the work you're
doing. We need all the wisdom we can get in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:24.520
years ahead. Yes. And for those of you watching
or listening, thank you for being with us because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:50.640
you are the reason that we are here.

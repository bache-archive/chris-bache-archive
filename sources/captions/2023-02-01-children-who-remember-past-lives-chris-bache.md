\[Music\] I think Stephenson's evidence is really a strong evidence for some type of continuity of an awareness from Lifetime to Lifetime especially his last two book which was a two volume book on philosophy and bi on reincarnation and biology in which he studied 1787 cases of children who not only had psychological recall from their previous lifetime but actually bore the marks in their body in the form of birth marks uh which replicated wounds of death in the previous Incarnation so somehow it was as if Consciousness had been traumatized in such a way that it not only imprinted on subsequent mind but it imprinted on the body of subsequent mind so after looking at this data a lot I think what it tells us is we have information in our mind at predates this body

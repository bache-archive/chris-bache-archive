a wonderful spacious place it was a little disorienting for me because I went so deep with him that when he was finishing I suddenly realized oh I have a talk to give I also would like to mention that the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic research is not a new cosmology it's the same cosmology that has been discovered and emerges in the deepest and the best mystical traditions around the world we are simply looking at a new set of technology a new set of techniques for entering into these states of consciousness it's a pleasure to be with the time waiver community again when I was with you last year I spoke to you about a book I was writing called diamonds from heaven this book has now been finished and it will be released this coming November the publisher has given it a new title Meredydd calling it LSD in the mind of the universe it's not my favorite title it will always be diamonds from heaven for me a revolution begins with the question what is it possible for human beings to experience the work in the global consciousness project is pushing the edges of what is it possible for human beings to experience parapsychological research pushes that question psychedelic research pushes that question what is it possible for human beings to experience the forward to this book was written by urban lass law firm so please is going to be with us this afternoon bye by television it is Ervin's work to provide through his mastery of multiple scientific disciplines to demonstrate that there is a super implicit super coherent cosmic intelligence that informs time and space it's my experience in my contention that psychedelics when they are used in a discipline and therapeutically structured environment they give us the opportunity to enter into a progressively deepening experience a deepening communion with this cosmic intelligence now as you all know here there is a revolution a renaissance in psychedelic research taking place across the world most psychedelic research today is taking place in two forms or is focused in two projects one of them is mapping the neurology and the biochemical pathways that psychedelics activate and the second is healing the personal psyche the wounds that we collect in life post-traumatic stress depression a variety of different conditions I think these are important first steps in reclaiming these valuable substances but these are only the first steps historically and cross-culturally are experienced with these mind-opening substances has been that healing the personal unconscious is only the first stage of a much longer journey the psychedelic acts the psychedelic agents we have access to today are so powerful that I believe they mark a new frontier in human experience we can shatter the shell of the earthbound mind so consistently that it becomes hard to describe the depths of cosmic communion that follow by taking our life to its limits and repeatedly shattering those limits we dissolve for hours at a time into flows of life that transcend all measures by entering these states with focus in clear intent by submitting to the harsh demands of death and rebirth we surrender all we have been to become something utterly new for six or eight hours at a time a being who can do things we could never do a being who could know things that we can never know as we enter larger and older levels of existence the universe receives us and tutors us it rewards our courage with exquisite intimacy's drawing us into almost unspeakable ecstasy's of discovery now my own psychedelic journey began 40 years when I was a brand new academic fresh out of graduate school and I met the work of stanislav grof and i read these two early books by him realms of the human unconscious which was published in 1976 and for me i'm reading this in 1979 and then quickly followed by LSD psychotherapy where he sets out the methodology of working clinically therapeutically in a very disciplined structured manner with psychedelics and integrating them into the therapeutic process I want to emphasize that what I'm describing today is not tripping it's not the recreational use of psychedelics it's not the careless engaging of these states of consciousness these are amplifiers of consciousness and when we contain that amplified consciousness when we take it into a meditational situation when we take it into a Kiva completely isolated from the outside world and use this energy to drive deeper and deeper and deeper into consciousness that's what I'm talking about that's what Stan Gross work is is exploring so first let me say a few words about the protocol that I used and then describe where this journey that I'm telling the story of in LSD in the mind of the universe where it went most of you who know Stan Groff's work and I have to assume a certain familiarity here most of you who know Stan Gross work know that the fundamental distinction he drew in their methodology was modos psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy psycholytic therapy was basically working with lower doses of psychedelics maybe up to between 40 and a hundred sessions where you peel the unconscious layer by layer stripping down the various levels of trauma or angst are our pains that we carry bit by bit in spring robe Hospital in Baltimore Maryland they developed a different form of therapy high dose psychedelic therapy the strategy was quite different there the strategy was to take an overwhelming dose a very high-level dose of it psychedelics about 500 micrograms and blow through all the levels of consciousness and try to trigger a near-death experience they were working with patients who were going to die terminally cancer to terminally ill cancer patients and they wanted to see if they could trigger a confrontation with the universe that would give them a glimpse of where they were going and so receive reduce the anxiety of death and they succeeded in doing so when I came along and I thought well if you could use psychedelics in this manner safely three times and their protocol was limited to a maximum of three doses per patient if you could do this work safely three times then you could do it safely more than three times and that's what I set out to do I began a quiet covert because I couldn't do this work legally I had to kind of create a barrier between my professional life that's a professor of Religious Studies and my personal life where I began the systematic work of exploring my own consciousness using Stan Grof protocols in psychedelic therapy it ended up being 73 high-dose sessions I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms spread over 20 years I did four years of work I stopped for six years for reasons that I explained in the book and then I did another ten years of very intense work I did this all between the time when I was thirty years old and fifty years old I stopped in 1999 and it's taken me this long to digest everything that I had experienced to put it in an organized fashion and to basically write it down in a way that I could share it with other people and it's not that what's not important is that I experience these things what's important is that these levels of consciousness are available for everyone to experience whether through psychedelics are through non psychedelics because it's the nature of the universe itself I want to emphasize that I'm not a psychologist and I'm not a therapist I didn't go into this work seeking healing though I received much healing I'm a philosopher as trained as a philosopher and I had a philosophical agenda and in this I traced this work back to William James in his varieties of religious experience where he talks about his experiences with nitrous oxide and the essence of this new philosophical modality is this first three steps first to push the boundaries of consciousness as hard as possible or to push the boundaries of consciousness second to write a detailed and complete phenomenologically accurate report of experience within 24 hours and third critically analyze your experience comparing it to other form other bodies of knowledge and comparing it to the experiences of other journey errs so a few words on the methodology oh I chime there but I I stopped when I got to the end of my 73 journeys and was beginning to write it up in the beginning I thought I was really just doing an extended course of psychedelic therapy and it was just psychedelic therapy nothing new when I got to the end and I was looking back over the course of where I went over those 20 years I realized that this was something different when you enter into this state so many times in a controlled fashion it opens up opportunities that were not considered in the early years of psychedelic therapy and it also represents challenges that were not encountered in the early years of psychedelic therapy I recognized that it needed a new name it needed something to differentiate it and so the name I gave it is psychedelic exploration the method is psychedelic therapy very controlled circumstances always working with a sitter always working can in contained and private environment I shade earphones listening to a very carefully curated musical list the difference between psychedelic therapy and psychedelic exploration is the number of sessions for me seventy-three sessions now I want to add that this is not a protocol that I recommend honestly I do not at the time I thought I could do this work safely and I did do it safely I always stayed within the limits of safety but I found that pushing yourself that hard that deeply into the universe generated complications that it took all of my resources to manage in the course of this time if I were doing this work over again I would be much gentler on myself I would balance high-dose sessions with low-dose sessions and because LSD tends to be a high altitude psychedelic I would balance working with LSD with working with psilocybin and ayahuasca which are more body grounded psychedelics I think a more nuanced approach would produce better results now I did this work as systematically as I could I've had very very detailed records came up with about 400 pages of my psychedelic journal I kept track of all the dates of course of my sessions I even looked at the astrological variables when I began to understand from Stan and from Rick tarnis their proposal that there was a correlation between the outer planets and what happens in one psychedelic sessions and I should mention that my protocol was highly standardized which allowed me to minimize as many variables as possible I always had the same sitter who was a clinical psychologist who might happen to be married to at the time was very handy the same sentence setting the same location the same substance the same dose level in the same recording process and I think the stability of all those variables keeping them constant it it it contributed to the clarity and the stability of the communion that opened in the psychedelic window that opened in this work now I want to mention that the story in diamonds from heaven I always to me it's diamonds from heaven the story that opened is not primarily a personal story I did not I'm not trying to tell a personal story in fact I dropped out a lot of the personal details it's a personal story of course because it's my experience but it's not primarily a personal story these waves represent a series psychedelic sessions which I have drawn overlapping to illustrate the point that these sessions are systematically there is a conversation that picks up in continued session by session the small circles at the beginning and endings of this of the session represent the openings and closing of a sessions I found that things that were relevant to my personal life tended to occur when I was leaving time and space and when I was coming back into time and space but during the peak hours of a session after the first twelve or fifteen sessions during the peak hours of a session I was usually operating far beyond personal reality and that's the story which is the most important story that's the story which is the philosophically more interesting story that's the cosmological story so this story is not a therapeutic story therapeutic story the personal details are very important a cosmological story they're less important when one does this work one enters into a regimen in which one undergoes many deaths and many rebirths the first death this line in this image everything below the line is time-space reality the drop at the end of this line at this blue image represents our individual time-space identity our egoic identity the first circle represents the death rebirth that takes place when we transition into spiritual reality ego death which is gets a lot of attention in the psychedelic literature what gets getting less attention so far are the deeper deaths that take place at deeper levels of existence now Stan Grof uses the vocabulary of psychic level transpersonal experience subtle levels transpersonal experience calls a level experience and asks because the universe tends to reveal itself in layers one goes through deaths when one moves into these deeper layers every time one goes into a deeper level of conch everything that one has known up until that time including your psychedelic experiences everything you know to be true including those psychedelic experiences must be surrendered if they truly new and novel dimension of existence is going to open when I was evaluating all of my experiences one of the questions I asked myself was okay there were many many deaths but how many fundamental core death rebirth transitions did I go through Oh back up one circle to describe a transition into a level of reality is an oversimplification one goes through levels within levels within levels these numbers represent session numbers and there is kind of an iteration a repeating going deeper and deeper and deeper into this level of reality but I asked how many times how many core deaths death rebirth cycles did I go through and identified five and here they are the first is the death of self the complete shattering of your time-space identity letting go of everything you have known yourself to be from the moment you're born until that moment in time ego death the second was entering into or took place at the level of the collective mind the collective psyche the third was entering into archetypal mind kind of the domain described by Carl Jung and Plato but different than either than portraying the third fourth entering into causal oneness now oneness is a theme which emerges much earlier in the journey but causal oneness is something quite distinctive there is no outer boundary at the level of causal oneness it is the totality of existence you cannot step outside this reality to get a perspective on it it is the totality it exists moving and living is one in the fifth level for me is the diamond luminosity what I call the domain of diamond luminosity which occupied me for the last five years of my journey now what I'd like to do now is shift to the book and simply take you through or show you the relationship between these stages and the chapters of the book the easiest way to do this is just do it maybe something like this the death of self there is the chapter crossing the boundary of birth and death there's a methodology chapter first explaining the methodology in the protocol but then crossing the boundary of birth and death exploring collective mind there are three chapters that address this the first has to do with the ocean of suffering the second is deep time in the soul or the fifth chapter deep time in the soul and the sixth is initiation into the universe I'm going to come back so I'm just going to push through here archetypal mind there is a chapter called the greater real of archetypal reality calls a oneness there is a chapter that I call a benediction of blessings Diamond luminosity is discussed in chapter 10 which is the largest number of sessions in the book twenty-six sessions almost a third of the entire journey but before I talk about Diamond luminosity I talk about the birth of the huger human which I have to drop back and this is a series of experiences that actually began during the initiation of the universe and continued into the diamond luminosity work and at the end after everything was said and done when I was in the last year of this work a final vision which was the capstone of the birth of the future human work so it's impossible to do more than just touch on a few themes a few descriptors of these chapters to give a sense of the trajectory of the work so first let's do that and then let's move this over crossing the boundary of birth and death is the easiest to summarize because it's the one that's very thoroughly described in stanislav grof s-- work it's the perinatal level of consciousness entering and transitioning through the perinatal level when one enters this work one becomes many people relive their own birth one has many profound encounters with death death and dying we get here by being born we leave the physical world by dying when one is pushing the boundaries and taking consciousness beyond the limits of physical consciousness birth and death get all complex ly intertwined until one goes through a series of profound existential crises confronting the meaninglessness of existence the futility of life understood as a physical purely a physical structure until eventually one goes through an event that usually is described as ego death in the ninth and tenth sessions this took me two years in ten sessions to navigate this process in the end the universe just snapping like a twig it everything I knew myself to do to be at the beginning of the day was completely reversed and inverted I began the day as a white male middle class philosopher obsessed with the meaning of life in the course of the session for hours I was immersed in the experience of women women of color women who were poor women who had no interest whatsoever in philosophical exploration and that's what I was that's what I became it was a frightening experience scared me to death but when I let go and when I allowed myself to become fully a woman that everything pivoted and I was taken into the world of women I experienced hundreds and hundreds of women I experienced many dimensions of female experience under the arm of the great mother I wish every man could have the experience that I had that day it truly was a broadening experience and the message was not reclaim your femininity or reclaim your former lives as women because I know I've had former lives as women the message was where you are going gender does not exist let go excuse me where things went next when I went through egodeath and I was expecting things to get lighter I mean after ego death things are supposed to get lighter where things went actually got much worse I entered a domain of extraordinary suffering collective suffering a domain of just unbelievable pain and unbelievable anger and violence and it this took place over two years and it deepened systematically systematically deepening and deepening deepening until eventually I had the experience of being becoming in some fundamental way all of the human beings of our entire species and gathering experiences that extended over a hundred thousand years just a massive at first I thought this was a deepening of ego death that somehow pieces of my ego had slipped through the news and there was I was dying it was my personal death and personal transformation that was driving these processes but it went on for so long and it took so many it there were so many beings involved that eventually I came to a different conclusion the conclusion I came to was that somehow something had shifted in my sessions and the universe was using my sessions to bring a kind of healing to some portion of the collective psyche with Ervin Laszlo I agree that there is an Akashic memory that holds the memory of everything that's happened in the universe and in the collective unconscious of our species we hold the entire history of our species we hold all the wars we hold the memory of all the terrible things that we've done to each other and just as our personal trauma burdens our personal life and must be cleansed if our personal life is to be free likewise our species holds these wounds and these wounds these these trauma must be cleansed if our species is going to function at a higher level so I came to understand by the end of this process that something was working to transform not me but through me to transform some aspect of the human species and help us move forward now there are two phases of a session and working like this there's a purification phase and then there's an ecstatic phase and the purification are suffering phase if you allow it if you take it as let it take you as far as it wants to take you if you let it take you wherever it wants to go even though you may not understand anything about what's happening it will eventually culminate come to a crescendo and it'll you'll go through a kind of a death and surrender process and when you go through that you wake up into a completely different reality completely unexpected reality and for the remainder of the session you're in an ecstatic state of consciousness and then when you resume the next session three or four months later the same process will repeat itself when I came through the ocean of suffering let me back up distich I did the ocean of suffering I said lasted two years there was a year of work and then I stopped my work for six years and then I resumed my work on the other side in the first year when I was going through the ocean of suffering when I came through the sessions I entered this territory that I call deep time in the soul I entered systematically for seven sessions over the course of the year I entered into a state of consciousness in which I experienced the totality of my life start to finish as they completed hold all the details of my life were suddenly present I was in the state that just totally overwhelmed me and systematically gave me an instruction on what my life was about how it was connected to the lives of the people around me this was the deepest most moving experience of my life at the time and yet at the in the first time when I came back from that experience I could not remember it it disappeared I had no reference points in my time-space consciousness to enter states of to anchor states of consciousness which shatter time-space or linear time but what I found was that when I went back to this condition in that state of consciousness a second third and fourth time I remembered more I was able to hold on to more I get more coherent a clear understanding of what was taking place you can learn how to stay conscious in levels of consciousness that you are not able to stay conscious in before and this is an epistemological and important epistemological state deep experiences of the universe are not simply given to you first you have to get to that level of reality to have these experiences but then you have to train yourself you have to be taught by the universe how to stay conscious in levels of consciousness that previously would not be able to stay conscious in it takes a great deal of discipline and training and the universe will train you to have accurate recall of levels of consciousness that were previously completely novel to you after the six year break that I took and I begin the work again the ocean of consciousness began exactly where it had stopped six years before and it kept getting worse and worse and worse the fact that it started exactly where it had stopped before I think says something about the intentionality and the and the magnitude of the intelligence that is guiding one's work I always felt myself to be in communion with an intelligence this intelligence never took any form I never saw any images that I would have so with it there were no deities or no forms of anything like that but I always felt myself in dialogue with a superordinate intelligence when I began the work after the six year break The Ecstatic portion of this session shifted into a completely different domain I entered into a process in which I was given a systematic course of instruction in the structure of reality at a cosmological level I know this sounds terribly arrogant and I apologize for that but that's simply what happened here are the names of the sessions that I used that I that I gave these sessions and I deal with in the book for me I give all of my sessions a name I try to identify the pith of what happens in this session and I give it a name so that when I see the name it reminds me of the session because I'm trying to hold all of my journey in my mind all at the same time I not only record my sessions I break them down into bullet points these are the names of the sessions that I'm addressing in the chapter of the initiation in the universe some of these I discuss in my book dark night early dawn the master plan was a series of experiences that took place which began and this this continued for years a series of experiences in which I seemed to be being taught what was happening to the human race and where the human race was going what is the larger developmental trajectory of humanity once again I apologize for the apparent arrogance of that it sounds like ego run amuck but eventually the ocean of suffering culminated in the 24th century what is a 24th session which I call healing the collective moon just an an orgy of suffering which eventually when it came to a head and it it climax it spun me into a level of reality that was ancient beyond reckoning it spun me into archetypal reality and the collective suffering never reappeared in any subsequent session where I went next with into the greater real of archetypal reality I entered a reality that was more real than physical reality it was like Plato's in Plato's cave where the fellow gets out of Plato caves in Plato's cave the cave and enters a real world which is more real than physical reality which is a very disorienting experience initially and when I enter this reality when I entered archetype of reality for the next year and a half I stayed in this reality over in my sessions I went through a death that was deeper than ego death I went through a death in which I had to cease to be a human being in any way shape or form my consciousness could no longer operate within the confines of even our collective psyche I entered a state of awareness which was beyond the collective psyche and it at that level I was being worked with to be taught how reality functions at this level the experiences the sessions that I address in this chapter are listed here my experiences here sort of divided into two levels there was kind of at the high suddle level the Platonic level in which I encountered archetypal forms archetypal beings that were just vast they were impossible for my mind to wrap itself around I image them as galaxies there were billions and billions of light-years across just impossible to imagine beings of such magnitude but these are beings who are the beings who are responsible for creating time and space itself beings were responsible for creating and governing the emergence of life inside time and space at a lower level at a lower subtle level I enter deep into the collective psyche and I repeatedly had the experience of the human species as a single organism and that all of our individual minds were fractal aspects of its comprehensive mind and even our bodies were cells within the unified body of humanity and that as we heal our minds and as we heal our bodies we actually contribute to the developmental history and the strengthening of the mind of our species and even the body of our species when I went into archetypal reality the deaths that I went through involved enormous energy fire volcanoes Sun flares just excruciating ly difficult experiences of being burned alive and consumed at this deep level and this I mentioned this because this is an important point what I learned was that as you go deeper into the universe every deeper level of reality functions at a higher level of energy this is well recognized in the deep mystical traditions a deeper level of consciousness is a higher level of energy and if you are going to have stable experience at that deeper level of consciousness you must stabilize your consciousness at that higher level of energy if your mountain climbing you have to stabilize dealing with less and less oxygen and you do that gradually in your ascent but if you're working in deep non-ordinary states of consciousness you must stabilize and accommodate to greater and greater levels of energy and you must learn how to manage those that level of energy otherwise your experiences there will be fragmented incoherent and you will not be able to bring back much of great detail I began to have experiences here of reincarnation as a collective phenomenon now I had previously I've written a book on reincarnation and the story I tell there is that reincarnation is kind and I thought of it as an individual soul story that that's the story that's given in our spiritual traditions that we are learning hopefully we're making progress we die we reborn we die reborn and our individuals choices lead to hopefully an improving destiny as our soul matures but now I began to have experiences of the entire planet as a single organism growing itself maturing itself through the pulsating rhythm of its entire population reincarnating century after century and I began to understand our was shown that our individual karma is all integrated and part of our collective karma and the boundary between individual karma an individual evolution and our collective karma and our collective individual evolution came down entirely and that's the primary theme of dark night early dawn that there isn't a separate it's impossible to achieve spiritual awakening by yourself because there is no private self to awaken all of our awakening emerges out of a collective context and it contributes back into the collective context in the end we are always working with the divine for the good of the entire species and beyond the species after the time spent in the in the where am I yeah and they great a real of archetype of reality I entered causal oneness I entered into a period of tremendous blessings it was a year of unbelievable blessings these were the four sessions that I address in this chapter the forest was an experience of emptiness Shunyata complete transparency no self in me no self anywhere in the world around me the entire world as a living oneness and when you experience oneness then you instantly experience no self the absence of an independent separate autonomous self when the self goes the world is one let me jump over the the diamond the birth of the diamond soul singing the universal way was an experience of the deep fertile void the primal void of not that is the matrix within which all form emerges Jesus's blood was an experience of extraordinary cosmic love being just awash with love like I had never known anywhere in my life or anywhere in my previous sessions but let me just mention diamonds the birth of the diamond soul because it comes up later in this experience in this session I had the experience of my former lives coming in Fast and Furious I've done a lot of work through hypnosis and whatnot on my former lives and previously I had experienced my life eleven years before it's a totality from end of beginning to end but in this session my former lives were coming in and they were like right rapping kite string around a kite spool except that what the the lies were like filaments of light and just wrapping them around around and suddenly they seemed to hit a critical mass and when they hit a critical mass they fused and when they fused there was an explosion of light an extraordinary diamond like light broke out of my chest and I was thrown into a state of consciousness that was both individual but a higher level of individual ality than anything I had ever known and I think what I was being shown in this experience what I was being given in this experience was a taste of where reincarnation is taking us reincarnation doesn't just result in the development of a little bit better this life a little bit better the next life acquiring more more moral insight more talents more this more that eventually sooner or later all of our experiences all that we have lived and learned in all of our different lives eventually all those experiences which we remember when we died in this you know we die we expand into the soul we come back into egoic awareness we expand into the soul back into a boat Gork awareness eventually sooner or later all of our life experience is integrated as a singular individuality inside time and space we wake up we wake up to the cosmic beings that we are that we truly are we no longer attempted to identify strictly with our body with our time-space body from here the work went into the diamond luminosity work but before I go into that I need to backtrack a little bit and talk about the birth of the future human I mentioned that in the initiation the universe work I started having a series of visions about the evolution of humanity now this sounds ridiculous at one level but it's not ridiculous from within the context of transpersonal psychology when you shatter your individual consciousness you don't simply flip into totality of oneness consciousness but you open into a multi-layered experience of multi-layered universe and one of the layers of that universe is the consciousness of our species and when you open to the consciousness of your species it's only natural that you would get insights into the growth of the species where we came from where we are and where we are going in my sessions over five years I was given repeatedly the same kind of story the same story different aspects which I address in this chapter I gathered all the different visions having to do with the future of humanity into this chapter the first is the visions of awakening six visions describing a profound awakening of the human psyche and the human heart a profound what I call the Great Awakening an awakening of a shift in the fundamental architecture of the collective unconscious a year and a half later after those first series of sessions I was taken it deep into deep time beyond personal deep time deep into collective deep time and I was taken into what appeared to be the death and rebirth of our species in near future I experienced this I didn't wasn't given any information about how or when or why except that it would seem to be triggered there was a global systems crisis that's seemed to be being triggered by a global ecological crisis and I was given I experienced the fact of this transformation and I experienced I was given a lot of insights into some of the mechanisms of how we would make this transition as quickly as we need to do it we have so little time to make the transition and it has to do with understanding the collective psyche it has to do with understanding that our collective unconscious is a field and that when this field is hyper stimulated with the suffering that we are entering into it becomes so hyper stimulated and enters into nonlinear or far from equilibrium conditions and that there is a certain structural parallel between what can happen in a psychic field when it is pushed into nonlinear conditions and what happens in physical fields when they are pushed into nonlinear conditions and we can extrapolate some of the insights from from physical fields and understand what might happen in a psychic field when it is pushed into nonlinear conditions specifically the capacity for rapid accelerated change heightened creativity and the emergence of a higher self organization in my visions in my sessions it was always this is going to happen faster than anyone can imagine faster than you can imagine faster than you can imagine the the pace of our development in the past was irrelevant to the pace of our development in the future and it has to do with what's happening at a deep collective psychic level from here I went into the diamond luminosity work five years of entering progressively entering into a field of consciousness that was completely empty devoid of content and clear clear beyond imagination just clear clear breathtakingly luminescent buddhism calls this dharmakaya the clear light of absolute reality the clear light from which physical reality Springs I called it diamond luminosity my time is running short I can only go through so much because I take comfort that all of this is in the book and you'll be able to go into greater detail when you see it out of these four sessions and I went into this reality only four times in five years five years of work to spend four days in this condition it was the high cost to pay in between these four sessions as you might imagine there was intense episodes of purification more purification more purification because when you just to touch this reality to be able to return to it and have stable experience in this reality you have to purify yourself of anything in you which is less than this reality the first to entrance into the diamond luminosity took place in sessions 45 and 50 and then after that we didn't go deeper didn't go deeper into the diamond luminosity but the diamond luminosity began to crunch itself deeper into my physical body it went that it was as if this light was restructuring my biology it was restructuring my mind my emotions my subtle energy system and actually restructuring my cell ural and that cellular anatomy in ways that I couldn't begin to understand but it was soaking itself deeper into my physical presence and I learned from these experiences that the purpose of this work was not simply to move into transcendence it isn't to go into some disembodied transcendent reality these fields are beautiful they're magnificent but the goal of the work was not transcendence ultimately the goal was to bring this reality deeper into our physical existence to let us much of spiritual reality as possible enter into our physical awareness and to transform our lives so that we become an integrated whole a being that balances spiritual reality and access to spirituality and the Magnificent universe which has been just stated inside spiritual reality the reality of time and space at the end in the very last year of this work I was given one final vision that was the capstone of everything that had gone on before in this final vision the universe put me through the absolute worst stripped-down process that it had ever put me through before it was just a cascading absolute loss of control stripped down dying dying burning deeper and deeper deeper until eventually it spun me into deeper into deep time than I had ever been before and I haven't even tried to explain what deep time is but again it's in the book it took me into a state of consciousness in which I was able to experience a hundred thousand years kind of as a simultaneous present I began to experience time in terms of the dying of whole life as a pulsation of death and rebirth of whole I experienced whole generations dying every few seconds being born and dying every few seconds just a radical expansion of the timeframe this I was given an experience of what the Buddhists would call samsara in the raw everything in this world being born dying conserving growing integrating being born dying and in this context I was given three teachings which I'll just mention the first was that it showed me that human beings are actually built for speed we are built for accelerated evolution and it has to do with the fact that each of our lives are are so short a hundred years merely a hundred years but underneath this repeated reincarnation there is a gathering of our knowledge a gathering of our of our experience and periodically this gathered knowledge flips and becomes a new foundation all subsequent incarnations and from this expanded time horizon I was I could see that human beings were actually designed for accelerated evolution we have a tendency to think human nature this human nature that to statically we have to think more dynamically more open-ended ly in terms if we want to experience ourselves and experience the human race from this perspective of the creative intelligence it's behind it all the other two experiences I mentioned was I experienced the universe as a diamond maker I experienced this reincarnation all these the cycling of reincarnation and I experienced sparks of diamond light shooting off periodically into the deep space into the deep sky and I understood that the universe is making diamonds and the Diamonds the distillation of all of our experience here into these crystalline pure forms that allow us to enter into dimensions of spiritual reality that we could never survive in if we hadn't gone through this hyper concentration hyperaccelerated developmental process which is taking place inside time and space and lastly I was given an experience of the future human taking deep and they allowed to experience for a short period of time the human being that nature is giving birth to in this long developmental process such an exquisite being just touching it for only a few minutes so helpful just totally expanded my understanding of human potential and showed us it's very important I think that we have an understanding that we have a vision of where we are going historically because as the shadows darken as we enter deeper into this historical crisis that we are entering into now as we enter the night of our collective soul we could lose hope we could think that it's all over we could think that we are somehow being punished for the sins of our past we could think that it's just we're entering into an extinction event but really we are in labor we have been gestating for hundreds of thousands of years Nature has been gestating us gestation is a long process birth is a relatively short process labor is a very very intense and painful process but at the end it gives birth to something wonderful something new I think that's what's happening historically after hundreds of thousands of years we are entering into labor and the crisis that we are entering at a global stage is synchronistically connected to a developmental crisis that is taking place inside each one of us we carry the entire history of the world in our farmer lives in our heart in our soul as the plant is struggling to become one and everything that that involves we are working to become one coherent integrated soul so that there is a relationship between this building tension in the global order and a building tension inside our psychological order as we give birth to a new species on this planet and as we give birth to a new center of consciousness within our own person again what is important is not that I had these experiences and I could be wrong on many different levels but what I think is important is that many many people are having these experiences as Stan Grof is documented and what's important is that these levels of consciousness are there for all of us to explore and again I do not recommend that people explore them as I explored them I truly don't I would not wish anyone to go through some of the things I went through in order to enter these domains I would be gentler we use a wider complement of experiences of techniques and technologies but they are there and they are there frost explore there is this massive information field which we can enter suddenly and temporarily or we can just sit here and open up and let it enter us and soak into our bones thank you very much [Applause] [Music]</p></body></html>

      <p>[Music] welcome everybody the very first YouTube channel and also audio podcast on anchor is where it will also show up YouTube channel interview in a series it's the the series is called you may have noticed Steven gray vision Steven gray all one word ste pH en and then capital gr a why vision and the purpose of these is to explore the possibilities of an awakening humanity I guess that's the simplest way of putting it and you will be able to subscribe to these I hope to be able to put a subscribe button up here somewhere at some point and some contact information both at the beginning and the end so as I say I'm very excited because this is the very first one of these in a series that I hope to continue for quite a while Chris beige is our first my first guest and we both acknowledge just before putting on the recording that we're both feeling honored about this and so that's really exciting in itself and so before I actually ask Chris to say anything I'm going to read a short bio and add a couple of little comments of my own so Christopher M beige officially is his professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and religion at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years he is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of integral studies and a fellow at the Institute of noetic scientists sciences an award-winning teacher Chris's work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness especially psychedelic states Chris has written three books life style life cycles I won't describe them here they're findable of course dark night early dawn which I read about 20 years ago wonderful book the living classroom which I have not read and his more recent or well quite recent about a year ago maybe or was it less remember six months yeah anyway LSD and the mind of the universe subtitled diamonds from heaven and also I'm going to be asking Chris about to give a summary of the 20-year journey that he went on that's described in LSD and the mind of the universe but I don't want it to take the whole interview and in particular because well among other reasons because it's he talks he does do a thorough kind of linear job of going through all that in two or three of these YouTube videos and so I would suggest if you really want to get into the details short of reading the book which is a stunner it's just amazing I would suggest going on YouTube and looking up diamonds from heaven time waiver summer world 2018 and there's a like a 50 minute talk that they recorded of Chris going through the whole journey and that book by the way I have it right here so I'm going to show it to you called LSD and the mind of the universe diamonds from heaven Chris don't let me forget at the end to ask you for any kind of contact information or links that you would like people to follow up on yeah thank you so anyway welcome Chris to my inaugural Steven gray vision youtube channel series it's a pleasure to be with you today Steven and honored to be in your Memorial voyage all right so you know there's lots of things I want to ask you about and discuss with you and the I think a good place to start however it would be if you could give a relatively short again because people can go and look at the video and you have videos on youtube if you could give maybe I don't know I've minute or something I don't know exactly sort of summary of you know well in the in the talks you talked a little bit about you know what got you into it you know maybe just real brief reference to you know why you did this in the first place and then a little bit about the 20 year journey and perhaps what you know where where it went after that something like that so basically what you're asking for is a highlight reel or trailer for the book yeah well I'm a philosopher of religion I was trained in foster of religion and I came to this work with an interest in the potential of psychedelics to explore the deeper reaches of consciousness and by pushing through our personal on personal unconscious entering into the consciousness what I eventually came to understand it's the mind of the universe itself so I did 20 years 73 high-dose LSD sessions and I'd emphasize the significance of that particular protocol high-dose sessions working at 500 to 600 micrograms because this opened up territory and experiences that were much deeper than when you're working with the types of psychedelics and the levels of doses of psychedelics which are being used in the therapeutic community today which is so important and very important development there this was different this is a much more aggressive shattering of different levels of consciousness and the boundaries of consciousness I worked for four years stopped for six years and then worked for ten years I did an average of about five sessions a year and where I want is a long story but the highlight reel is I spent about two years basically working at what Stan Grof calls the perinatal level of consciousness processing a lot of material around very early experiences birth experiences death experiences fear of death experiences existential crises kind of work went through a deep ego death had just exploded my identity and catapulted me into early level spiritual experiences spiritual reality then spent another two years going through a much more intense purification process that I called them the dark night of the soul where the work clearly pivoted it took me a long time to recognize it but it clearly pivoted away from my personal transformation are my personal healing and entered into the collective psyche where the focus was the healing or transformation of this species mind itself where I was processing experiences coming from thousands and hundreds of thousands of persons and thousands of years of time when that culminated I was spun into archetypal reality experience various permutations of archetypal reality and best territories and the collective unconscious and basically was learning how to speech is live as a single integrated entity as a single being all of us being fractal embodiments of that being when that culminated I went through yet another round of death and rebirth into causal level reality were basically instead of the world being composed of parts even the very big parts of archetypal reality here the universe basically pulsed as a single entity as a single life form dissolving all boundaries all membranes even the membrane between matter and spirit I explored or was given many gifts in that territory for about a year and a chapter that I call the benediction of blessings and then for the last five years of my work I entered into a domain of that I came to call the diamond luminosity entering into a state of consciousness that was pure light and the most difficult thing to describe is the hyper hyper clarity just clarity beyond measure of this form of light I discovered that there are many levels of light and the diamond luminosity was the the purest highest level I reached in my what Buddhism calls dharmakaya are the absolute reality the clear light of absolute reality for those five years I entered this reality only four times in 26 sessions with a lot of purification a lot of a lot of healing work done in those intermediate sessions and then I was given one final vision of a human trajectory where we are in history which had been a consistent theme in the work and then basically the universe kicked me out it gave me two sessions wrapped up our work without be really understanding yet at the time that it was wrapping it up but it wrapped me up wrapped up our work and then ushered me on my way and I stopped my work so I stopped the work I began it in 1979 and I finished it in 1999 and after I finished it spirit said to me in my meditation 20 years in 20 years out meaning that it would take me 20 years in order to understand and digest the 20 years of experiences that I had had and then it just so happened not by any intent but it just so happened that LSD in the mind of the universe was published 20 years after my last session hmm wonderful yes and you know for people watching and listening to this I want to say that you know if you didn't quite gather how stunning this journey or series of journeys really has been read the book because it's mind-blowing it's truly paradigm shattering material I like to occasionally joke with no particular offense to Terence Mckenna who did a lot of lovely work that the descriptions that he gives of where he went we're just kind of tapping into the realms where you have explored where you've gone into the you know in these in these journeys so a practical question though or sort of yeah user friendly question so to speak you have spoken in different ways about well several things related to this one is you said you wouldn't do it the same way again because it was so intense and then you also understood that it wasn't about getting anywhere particularly that's one aspect of this question I'm about to pose the other one is clearly this is not for everybody and so there's something in there and and then just on a practical level for people who do feel like they are those sort of deep exploring Psychonauts and want to do something like this feel that kind of a call like you have could you just briefly describe the protocol the safety protocol that you employed well let's start with the safety protocol yeah I basically used the protocol established by Stanislav Grof in the early years of his work and published in his book LSD psychotherapy in 1980 he distinguishes clearly low-dose psycholytic sessions and high dose psychedelic sessions in the early years those psychedelic sessions were limited to three I basically took that protocol which always and then and then multiplied the number of sessions to 73 but I was always working in isolation I was working in the privacy of my home or my wife's clinical office I was always lying down protected from the outside world no interruptions I had a sitter my sitter for all this work was Carol my first wife a clinical psychologist listening to a very carefully curated playlist of music to support the deepening and the unfolding of the work so basically the sessions were completely internally focused sheltered from the outside world there was no interface with the outside world accepted the music and the focus was on encountering as deeply as possible what was arising from within my own consciousness now the reason I before we go any further yeah a quick question regarding the sitter for anyone who going to do this kind of work on their own what would you say the Job Description prerequisites are for the sitter like dude that does that person need to have been to some of these inner realms themselves to be able to do that job or what would you say you know who could do that job properly ideally a person who's doing the sitting should be experienced in these domains it depart Lee depends upon how interactive the work is but the more experienced the sitter is the more comfortable he or she is likely to be when the subject gets into this territory in our case Carol was not really interested in exploring these domains herself she read the literature with me and that's not perhaps an ideal circumstance but it was it worked sufficiently well for us the responsibility of the sitter is to take care of the the subject so that they don't hurt themselves because some of the spasms that come up in this session they're pretty violent there's a lot of throwing up when you're working with high doses and that has to be taken care of basically making sure the subject stays focused so that there's no acting out any attempt to sort of step away and step outside of the session needs to be discouraged and keep the person folk material and then managing the music staying in touch with the subject so that they know they can anticipate where the subject is sometimes asking questions but usually not often so that they can shift the music when the person has gone into a shift in their own inner experience can you say a little bit about the music how important it is is it to get the right kind of music I think in your talk the one that I mentioned on YouTube you said something about it kind of a developing quality to the music as it changed over the course of the of the session of the yeah it was six eight hours or so yeah well I basically followed Helen Bonnie's recommendations that Stan had cited in his early work and she differentiates five stages of an LSD session and there's basically an ascending there's an early latency and then when the drug begins to kick in there's a high activation and again this is working with high levels of LSD where the activation level is particularly intense and there's a huge surge and the quantity of energy that one is processing and that continues to build and you want music that can encourage the surrendering encouraging the giving in to whatever's happening and that it supports the breakthrough of your own defenses and then the experiences will build until you reach a level where eventually if you manage them well courageously you go through some form of crisis some crisis and the experience some death and rebirth experience where then you're catapulted for the remainder of the session into the ecstatic portion of the journey my experiences were always the early portion of the session was a purification experience culminating and then ending in an ecstatic portion of the experience then there's a long peak of the experience where once you've made that breakthrough you want music that supports the long expanding expansive worldview and then a very very slow decline re-entry with gentle music that gives you a spacious background that allows you to process your experiences and as you come back to your ordinary consciousness integrate your experiences with your conventional your identity or ordinary identity I found that after a number of sessions that when I began to use indigenous music chanting with my sessions I found that to be much more powerful much more evocative than classical music even powerful classical music so I had a preference for that and so I collected a lot of indigenous music over the years from different cultures and you don't want music with any words that you can understand so you want music that doesn't keep you on familiar ground which is another advantage of indigenous music you know vocal or non vocal types because it throws you into foreign territory and the foreign territory is what you really want to be exploring right now not staying on the familiar ground absolutely yeah so before we get into the sort of farther reaches of some of the experiences you had and implications of that I just listened or watched parts of that video that I'd mentioned earlier and you referenced William James the great early 20th century's psychologist mm-hmm who said something like that there are three stages of this kind of work that you've been doing and one is the first one is kind of you know pushing the boundaries going out into exploratory territory but then following that up with meticulous recording and in a third stage of analysis and sharing is that more or less accurate yeah that's my that's not so much William James but it's my articulation of the principles of psychedelic philosophy based on the pioneering work that James did in that he used nitrous oxide and drew very striking conclusions in the context of the varieties of religious experience book and basically I just articulated this method from that that you go into temporary non-ordinary States you record those states afterwards as clearly and precisely as you can and that's important because that's really important I think to complete the circle of learning because if you want to do this in a systematic fashion integrating and attending to and trying to understand your experiences lays the foundation a strong foundation for your next set of experiences just like our dreams are very revelatory but if you keep a dream journal people find that their dreams often become more powerful more articulate it is as if your mind knows that you're paying attention the unconscious knows you're paying attention to it and therefore it ups its game likewise on a session the more attention you pay to integration and consolidating your experiences it is as if the cosmic mind knows you're paying attention and therefore it engages you more systematically at the end so retaining the experiences is really important and particularly if you're pushing the far boundaries like I was doing and entering into territory that was radically new to me an uncertain and I didn't have many cues even in in the psychedelic literature for trying to understand much of it writing at the very edges of my of my ability and trying to consolidate what I experienced was an important part of the process and if I can loop back to your earlier question why I wouldn't do it the same way again I wouldn't do it the same way because of some of the things I learned on the journey first of all I found that over the long haul working at doses this high even doing it very responsibly and conscientiously and supplementing it with a lot of other spiritual practice a lot of attention to my body a lot of yoga a lot of meditation it's a very very demanding protocol it exerts its it's a very taxing protocol if I were doing it over again I would be gentler with myself I would balance high dose sessions with low dose sessions I would balance LSD which tends to be a high level cosmic level psychedelic with psilocybin ayahuasca other psychedelics which are more body grounded in order to facilitate an ongoing integration of the peak experiences doing it the way I did just hammering the high levels is pushing and pushing it did open great cosmic vistas but I think it I think I was hard to run myself that I really needed to be and maybe then was wise it took me a long time to internalize it in some ways too recuperate from that entire journey the other reason I would do it a little differently is because I learned along the way that this is not a journey that comes ever comes to a distinct end when I began this work I thought there was an endpoint I was trying to get to the endpoint some people described the endpoint as oneness with God are entering into the primal void and I had entered into oneness with the divine many times and I had learned that there are many levels to that experience and even levels to immersion in the primal void and deep about two-thirds of the way through the journey I had an experience where the universe showed me that it's an absolute infinite universe I would never be able to get to the end of it it's an open-ended journey you take in as much of the universe as you can as as healthy and as wise for you but the idea of getting to the end was just it was a misconception and because of that that's another reason why I would just be a little gentler and a little patient with the pace of a slower pace of evolution the Buddhist teacher Chuck iam trungpa has one of his books is called journey without goal familiar with the ten ox herding pictures yes yeah the way I've encountered them was like the last one is something like and thus ends the journey that never need to have been made in the first place or something like that yes yeah yeah and now it's a little different you know I started this work kind of with a focus on enlightenment and that really is what the ten ox herding pictures are about that journey of awakening to the ever present condition so that in the end you come back to where you were but you come back with your filters clear and the the present the always present ever-present condition is luminously there that's where I that's the agenda I started with but it was overs come over it was superseded by two other aspects first it was superseded by the challenges of our collective enlightenment of our collective evolution eventually my personal healing or my personal enlightenment to assist completely superseded by responding to the call to support our collective transformation the transformation taking place in history and the second thing that superseded then even that was the opportunity to explore the deep structure of the universe itself to what I'd call a cosmological exploration you do not need to explore the deep structure of the universe in order to become awakened to become to your spiritual senses you do not need to go back to the beginning of the universe and the Big Bang to transcend all limits of time to enter archetypal reality to abide in the the true and natural condition that Buddhism calls there are essential nature these are different projects so my work kind of combined the enlightenment project but really it kind of yielded to a different project what you might call the the Philosopher's project the invitation to explore as far as I could the nature of cosmic reality mm-hmm yeah wonderful thank you for clarifying that so I don't know how to ask this question exactly or even if it is a good question but but something like this you know that kind of deep work is clearly not you know prescribed for a great majority of people it's for particular individuals who feel that they they're not calling and you know feel that they're up for it and you you've indicated in your talks that you felt that calling you know earlier at the beginning of your career you know that you'd always been interested in that state and you felt like are those kinds that you know um you know effing the ineffable is Allen Watts but unscrewing the inscrutable so I guess where I'm trying to go with this question is people hmm a lot of people are not ever going to use psychedelics but then there's another whole subset of people in the in the communities that wear the you know in the populous that are working with these and I'm I guess I don't know if they're you know like I say what you could say about this but you know the people that are not in that small group of people that are going to do that extremely deep work do you have any have you had any kind of thoughts intuitions feelings about you know how a lot of people can approach the work that needs to be done with the help of psychedelics hmm well first you're right that I wrote LSD in the mind of the universe with the hope that it would be read not only by other psychedelic voyagers I hope psychedelic voyages would would read it and there would be a kind of conversation that would emerge from Voyager to Voyager back and forth but I hope that this book would also be read by people who are not interested in taking psychedelics and or who haven't had the opportunity because what's important I think in so many ways in the book is the cosmology that emerges is the visions of reality that emerged in the psychedelic state and these can be very valuable to people whether or not they ever touch these experiences themselves just to see what the understanding of reality that comes forward and I've had many people write me since the book has come out and say I've never taken psychedelics in my life but I've been a lifelong meditator and I really relate to what you're saying I've had many many similar experiences of collective suffering for example or different death and rebirth experiences but I've never used psychedelics and that's of course what we expect because psychedelics are simply an amplifier of consciousness its consciousness that does the work so if you work with consciousness in a focused way then naturally you're going to have similar experiences in different ways to what emerges in a psychedelic session now for people who want to work with psychedelics several basic rules of thumb stand out for me one of them is very very meticulous attention to set in setting and which of course I think is widely understood now but I would emphasize clarity of intention in creating the conditions of long-term engagement sometimes our engagement is short by a few months sometimes our undertaking is several years of work but the longer our focused engagement the more important it is to really set up the shop carefully to really have your kiva prepared both inwardly and outwardly so that your contact what you want is clean contact and good recall in clean contact means not obscuring the field with a lot of other things going on or tending to a lot of outside things tripping is fine if people want to trip and a lot of people have life-changing experiences tripping no criticism there but if you want to use this for deep inner work you have to clarify your field clear it out and then the second thing that stands out is the importance of retention the importance of holding on to your experiences clarifying recording them either with works of art sometimes people do it with music for me it's always been the written word methodologically this a lot of the work which is being done important work being done with psychedelics is therapeutically focused aimed at healing the wounds of the personal psyche and that's really important work and we're learning a lot about that particularly now in this Renaissance of psychedelics but that which heals at the therapeutic level at the personal unconscious level is also that which opens work experiences deeper into the cosmos itself it's in renewing our relationship with the universe that heals so much of our wounds of incarnation and if you are called or feel called to push the boundaries I mean it really is there are some people who love to climb mountains and love some people who love to you know go deep into the oceans they just have an adventurous spirit and I think that also is true for those who want to explore states of consciousness but it takes a certain personality type if you will to you have to a certain rigor a certain capacity to maintain ambiguity and to deal with ambiguity a certain kind of mmm stability of your social circumstance because it's not just you who go into these states but into a degree everyone that you are intimately associated with is touched by your work so you have to make sure your life is grounded and solid that supports the work and the last thing I would mention is the deeper you want to go into these non-ordinary States the more important it is to have a daily spiritual practice I just have become so convinced of this over the time because you need a daily spiritual practice to ground first just the energy that's unleashed in these states and then to ground the experiences the more you learn about mysticism and the more you study the autobiographies of our great saints and sages the easier it is I think to have it gives you a touchstone for grounding your more radical experiences mm-hmm you know it's funny you mentioned the great Saints and all that and I don't think there's an answer to this but it's just been on my mind a little bit later lately that you know there are these you know kind of pinpoint people over the last couple of thousand years that you know we hear about I don't remember all the names but you know st. John of the Cross st. Francis Meister Eckhart and a few of these great mystics that we know but you know of course you know there are probably many from indigenous traditions that weren't writing anything down you know but you know where are these people now I mean are there just too many of us for them to stand out on the planet now like where are the people like we're on Ramana Maharshi and these people that seem to have completely gotten it so speak yeah I don't know the answer that question that's kind of a sociological and historical question I don't really know the answer I think that we are that they're more hidden Saints that we might appreciate but I also think in a fundamental way I agree with those who have observed that the age of private enlightenment is coming to an end it's already come to an end and it's not like individual you know enlightenment work is not important it is important but we have entered into a time of history where we need to draw the whole human species needs to enter into the enlightened condition the whole human species needs to really get at the roots of what's holding us in this tight configuration of ego because the world the civilization that we are in now is the civilization built by the ego and the ego is ultimately a cut off psychological entity we we don't experience our common ground with other beings and we don't experience our common ground with the universe itself it's a fragmented condition and it builds a fragmented universe and right now the fragmentation of our universe is threatening the very vitality of the lifes of the all life on our planet so I think we are moving into a time where the real impetus is collective transformation and that's a that I think is kind of taking us in to a different level of the game and we were in for the last 2,000 years yeah well put beautifully but yeah my old Buddhist teacher that I mentioned earlier chÃ¶gyam trungpa I don't you probably know more about this than I then I do as a concept but I think there are different uses of the word term are hot but we trumpet talked about it was he he was critical of what he called the our Han mentality which was the Enlightenment for self kind of mentality was the way he designed it yeah so you know I completely agree with you so perhaps that leads in for me anyway into this discussion of the sort of great death and great awakening that you talk about in your work and that you explore it in those journeys and you know the probably the primary motivation for me doing this YouTube channel series altogether is because of the kind of things you were just talking about that we've reached a calm a kind of karmic comeuppance point where the that fragmented ego mentality has brought that planet to place where it's not sustainable to continue in this direction anymore yeah so I'm wondering if you could explode me and talk a little bit about I know one thing that you've you mentioned in your talks is that you you you weren't given a timeline on this there was no 2012 involved but it sounds to me like I don't know an image I've been using occasionally is a vote coming down a river toward a whirlpool or you might use the term vortex and you know at first when when when the boat first gets pulled into the into the orbit is aware of the of the vortex it's going around the outer edge kind of slowly but then it's gradually getting pulled the strength becomes of the pull becomes increasingly strong and rapid and it seems to me we're we're well into that vortex now I don't know what you can you comment on yeah well this was a great surprise for me in my work because when I began this work I was thinking that this I was thinking in terms of a model of individual transformation but it was doing this work to transform and improve my my private self in some way and and that was shattered after two years the game changed it was it was not about that and about four years into the work I began to be given a series of visions that continue to unfold over over 50 sessions and the the theme of these visions was always humanity's collective transformation they were consistent in in over over time and the message was humanity was coming to a point of before-and-after point in history of a decisive transformation of an evolutionary jump in the the quality of consciousness that we would be living out of and through just just a an exponential time of great blessing a time of great grace of great illumination of great healing and these visions came for years but I was never shown in these early years how nature was gonna pull this off because when I looked around me it didn't look like that was what was happening and it looked like we for every indicator that we were getting better there were other indicators that we were getting worse that more insanity more greed more corporate control and and then in 1995 I was given a very very deep session of series of visions and I was taken into the future time became very poor able permeable in my sessions I I entered into multiple modalities of trans-temporal experiences and in this I entered into the deep future and I experienced what I came to understand was the death and rebirth of our entire species and some collective historical crescendo and I experienced it not as Chris Bosh individual self looking on and not even as a spiritual aspect of Chris bass looking on by this time I had dissolved so many times and so deeply into the collective mind that I experienced this crisis as they asked the species I experienced it literally as a rippling of crisis arising within the collective psyche and I experienced a time of tremendous suffering a time of things falling apart of loss of control of human beings losing more and more of the constants of their world it the image that comes to mind is of a hurricane that's coming over a small island which is just threatening all life on the island and for a time in my experience I thought we were going to go extinct I thought we were heading into an extinction event but then at the peak time the storm passed and humanity began to recover to pick themselves up and when we began to pick ourselves up something extraordinary happened in the process of going through this crisis we were changed I think it's our heart was broken open in a way there was some kind of deep transformation when the pain became so terrible we we began to make choices that we weren't willing to consider making at an earlier time of stability in such extreme instability we began to make different choices and when we were past the worst of this crisis there was a tremendous kind of absurd new values new insights new ways of being new ways of organizing if there were one fundamental theme that emerges it is the theme of oneness we had an experience deep in our psyche of oneness that permeates all existence and that that's a tremendous spiritual revitalization and then subsequently in other sessions I was taken deep into deep time and given an experience of what I came to call the future human that that is this is a change which is not going to simply precipitate a political restructuring or an economic restructuring or a social restructuring it's a change which is going to reach so deeply into the collective psyche that it actually causes an evolutionary flip of the archetype of the blueprint or the archetypal blueprint of the human psyche so that there is literally a an emerge an emergence of a restructured core around which our individual lives crystallize in time I came and just to touch this future human to go into deep time and just to touch it was such a clarifying experience it was so gratifying because this magnificent a humanity with its heart healed of all the pain that we've caused each other through time and that has been caused in us by nature a tremendous illumination of the human mind it was truly an enlightened species that was emerging out of this process and this has been this I think gave the larger context for my entire life in my understanding of history that we are in right now it gave a context which helped me understand why my individual enlightenment fell away is insignificant and my sessions went for years aiming at collective transformation and trying to support this collective transformation wherever possible it did not give me any timeline as you said it did not give me any specifics it did not tell me when where or how but the certainty and the magnitude of this convulsion seemed to be driven by some kind of global ecological crisis that triggered a global systemic crisis crisis of global systems which then I began after I began to have these experiences I began to do my ecological homework I began to read more widely and the ecological literature to pay attention to the people who have been tracking these things and I think it's clear you know and I give the references in the book that we are coming to a critical time in human evolution we're on the verge of losing the planet if we don't change our ways and we don't seem to be changing our ways nearly fast enough to avoid a crisis of unprecedented proportions so I had these experiences Oh 1985 to 1999 you know 20 years ago and it seems that these are unfolding now that we are entering increasingly a time of ecological plague in a way a time of great great ecological uncertainty coming at us devastation coming at us in global climate change in this context I I watched Cove in nineteen and I don't see it as the true crisis of this era it seems to be too small a crisis but it's a serious crisis and it's a crisis that if we respond to it will it could teach us many things that we will need when the deeper crises emerge which are coming in the decades ahead and I think I think it is teaching us I mean it there are those who are learning from it and then those who are just trying to quickly get back to normal as quickly as possible but I think I think normal we're going to find is farther and farther irretrievable we now have no choice but to go into a new future and to find our way into this new future and I think the divine or whatever you want to call the intelligence of the universe the creative capacity of the universe is pulling us that way it supports us as we cooperate with this crisis it's taking us somewhere that it wants us to go beautiful yeah yeah yeah I've the I've kind of had the same intuition about the the kovat situation I it's kind of a fantasy I suppose you could say in my mind that that you know the the gods as it were whatever that is as you say the divine mmm there I don't know how this functions of course and how hands-on they would be with our journey but it I could almost imagine that there that the co vid situation is kind of like letting us down step by step like here's what can happen when there's a great disruption mm-hmm and as you say you know what what kinds of changes in our individual mentalities and the way that we do things collectively might come out of this and you know of course that remains to be seen but you know I have a feeling that at the very least you know the whole world has been quieter and cleaner for a while and you know even if people I mean I could be completely wrong about this but I wonder if you know that even if people don't really consciously kind of pay attention to you know the implications of that it's it's gotten in under their skin on some level you know birds are more audible there may be more of them around you know the air is cleaner the pace of life has been slower I'm seeing so many people riding bicycles around my neighborhood you know I'm hoping that more of them will you know if many of them will continue to ride those bicycles people are jogging like nothing like nobody's business around my neighborhood lately you know they're gonna come you know when people get back to their quote-unquote normal life III think a lot of people are gonna find that they've come back rested healthier they've probably been eating more at home cooking more at home yeah it's hard to find yeast in the stores around him you know but at the same time you know the way you described this great death you know trajectory sounds pretty frightening in a sense you know and I guess Tim what comes out to my mind comes into my mind about that is that it's increasingly becoming more and more important for anyone who possibly can to be a rock as it were for others you know yeah it is frightening it really is frightening and I think it's therefore important to really understand what's happening I mean there are a lot of people who will be calling on the apocalyptic end of days and all sorts of interpretations there'll be people the talking about extinction and so on and so forth but I think what's really happening is that we are in labor where this is a birth gestation is a long process it's a nine-month process but labor takes place with 24 hours it's a very short very intense process in which we give birth to something new I think Humanity has been just aiding the future human for thousands and thousands of years but the process of giving birth to it is really convulsive and if you walked into a room when there was a woman giving labor right in the middle of it and she's yelling and screaming and everyone's running around you would think oh this is terrible she's gonna die but if you know what's happening you know that this is labor this is what labor is like well we are going into a collective labor I believe and and therefore it's important for us to to cultivate an appreciation of what this actually consists of we are giving birth to a new form of human being not simply better in a few little ways dressing up the edges but a deep reconstruction of the human psyche and the way I've come to understand this is in terms of the concept of the diamond soul which is a different image but basically refers to other sessions that I went through where I experienced what seemed to be I was given a series of teachings experiential teachings about where reincarnation is taking us know it and it led me to have an understanding of reincarnation which went considerably beyond the way it's been talked about in the traditional Eastern sources because I think basically the idea in traditional thinking of reincarnation we reincarnate we reincarnate we reincarnate karma follows us we make improvements we get a little bit better and better we go from third grade to 4th grade to fifth grade hopefully more compassion more intelligent more resourceful incremental incremental change but I think what happens eventually in the reincarnation process we die and we go into spirit where we reconnect with soul the consciousness that holds all of our experience we're ORN we get small we learned we die we get large we born we get small and we keep this up for thousands and thousands of years only touching our soul our total consciousness usually in the afterlife state in the Bardo state but if this keeps up all of us has been going through this four thousand thousands of years sooner or later there comes a point where I think all what happened in my sessions all my former lives started coming in and they hit critical mass they and when they hit critical mass there was a massive explosion of energy and they fused and when they fuse an extraordinary diamond light broke out of my chest and it catapulted me into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had been in up to that point and it was a state of consciousness in which I was an individual but I was an individual beyond any frame of reference that I had known it previously and I think what that's what's happening with reincarnation that there comes a time in history when all of our former lives become integrated in the early stages when we integrate our former lives we often have to deal with leftover pain and problems that have been that are still reside in these former lives so the emphasis is on healing and and clarifying but eventually when they are when all of that work is done and they fuse into a new singularity and that singularity I think is the birth of the soul in time so that we permanently shift our identity from the ego of this small short-term body which lives maybe a hundred years to the soul which lives and thinks and feels on a much much larger time horizon I think this birth of soul consciousness inside time is taking place simultaneously well as the planet is trying to come to terms with its divisive history and is trying to deal with it problems which it cannot solve at the national level but can only solve the global level as we're trying to come together as one planet internally the players there are trying to come together as one soul so that there is a reciprocity between the the outer political ecological dynamic in the inner cycle spiritual dynamic so that I think the ego is the psychological structure that built this world and the ego will never be able to solve the problems that we have generated it takes the expansion of the soul to really have the depth of courage and the depth of compassion and the depth of insight to really carry us into the creation of the next stage of our planetary evolution yeah beautifully put again yeah yeah my sense of of this passage I guess you could say is that it you know it is scary as we are saying that it looks like a lot of things that you know people have been able to you know hold as as status quo and stability are going to be ripped away from us and so on and so on it's going to be a really challenging time I guess the hopeful or more optimistic part of my my mind adheres to this old saying necessity is the mother of invention and it feels like as we move out of it's like we've been you know as you know living in you know in an illusion in a sense you know in a kind of a collective and individual dream that's virtual that's based in our thoughts and our you know and it's in our heads and all that and you know as Kant Tara Terence Mckenna has and others have put it whistling past the graveyard you know trying to ignore that you know the reality of ego death and the spirit that you know encompasses all but as we as these conditions destabilize I think perhaps one of the amazing thing that's things that's going to come out of this is you know because there is such a deep well of creativity and capability in the human species I think we're going to see a lot of that coming forth know that oh that's another one of my favorite sayings from Victor Hugo something to the effect of there's nothing as powerful as an idea whose time has come right yeah so I think we're going to see you know as as the old ways become less viable people can put less faith in them a greater openness to new ideas yes I think we're experiencing this profound polarization taking place now there will be forces pulling us very strongly toward the past towards the divisions of the past towards the certainties of the past towards the patterns of the past and then there will be forces taking us into of the future taking us into something less certain more unexplored but but I think the the jew's is going to be with the future because with the past if we if we keep allow ourselves to be pulled into the past and the patterns of consumption and corporate control and so on violence and you know placing one race over another or one religion over another one continent over another that way ends in death it just ends in death but a different future a collaborative future working for a world that works for all working working where a certain portion of the population has less so that everybody has more is going to produce a much much happier better existence for all of us and in the end and I think we have the courage to make it I think you know things like the coronavirus are basically giving us an opportunity to flex our courage to flex our wisdom and to say no when we're being told lies by people who represent the past people who represent you know that the faded wisdom of patriarchy the faded the you know the unspeakable shame of ego and we see it dramatized on the body politic today you know and and that just leaves a sour taste in our mouth where when we see courage when we see compassion when we see wisdom in sight working for our collective good that we recognize and say yes I want to be like that I want to support those forces mm-hmm yeah so again hopefully that you know as Leonard Cohen put it there's a crack and everything that's how the light gets in that the light will be coming in and you know you know I was I read some of the channeled books that were popular back in the late 80s and early 90s and one guy that I didn't liked more than others was a guy named Ken Carey he had a book a couple of books called star seed the new millennium and things like that and one of the things that assuming this was actually child that his you know Chan his source his entity was saying was these technologies that you have you know these communication technologies they're actually pretty interesting because you know when when the information gets to the point where you can you know be sending out that you know the idea whose time has come we now have this capability of sharing information instantly around the planet pretty much right mm-hmm it's like a we have these stepping stones in a sense now right mm-hmm yeah and and I think what I'm saying and what I'm describing if if it were just me having these experiences and then it would be maybe not that significant but a lot of people have been having these experiences and sharing these ideas they've been seeing the same thing a lot of psychedelic villagers have been seeing this basic vision of a time of fundamental historical crisis and choice indigenous cultures have been seeing this vision emerging for decades in their work mystics like and contemplatives meditators who had never gone near psychedelics have been having this deepening insight that this is a time of crisis this is a time of where we must grow and I think that's one way of looking at it this is a time of maturation we have to grow up and to take responsibilities as adults and there's a certain way in which we've been living like adolescents with the qualities of adolescents but now we need to grow up and I think we have that capacity and I really think we will I think we're going to make this transition even though it's going to get difficult I just have confidence in I think when I'm really feeling deeply uncertain and fearful I remind myself that the universe has brought us this far and I know that there are n rows there are extinction events that are taking place all around us but I trust that if if we are entering into a time of such momentous choice and consequences that we the universe must think that we're ready and I think I well it's why I placed my trust in the universe's wisdom and at least in my sessions the universe seems to clearly think that we're ready in that it knows what it's doing and we will be able to participate in that knowing well this is the reason why I'm so happy that you are my initial or inaugurate of guests on this hopefully developing series because that you know this one it's it's it's central to to why I have such respect for you and your work chris is that that it's hopeful it points out that there you know who we possibly can be and that there was there is a way to get there right you know there is a little bit like the Four Noble Truths you know that that there is a way to get there you know there are pathways and and you know and as we've been talking about here you know people need that kind of you know encouragement that kind of you know vision to be shared you know as things get you know less stable for people that they have less to less ground to hang on to so I think this is probably a good time to bring it to a close we've been talking for close to an hour and I'm it's clear that you could have a lot more to say on these topics so we might have to do it again actually it just occurred to me at this very moment because your your I'll have to say you're an easy interview Chris because I just need to ask one question and articulate it so so clearly and so beautifully I really appreciate that I'm really moved in my heart to you know to hear these kinds of things that you have experienced and that you're sharing with people so this being my very first one I don't haven't figured out how to end these yet I know sometimes people would you know say goodbye to the guest and then talk to the talk to the the viewers a little bit but I think I'll just do that while you're still here if you don't mind so also before you do that and that's fine to do but first I want to thank you for your initiative because because you've been drawing people together in the conference's that you've been organizing for years now and your commitment to our collective transformation has been profound and this continues in this series your your your vision is for collective awakening and I just honor that and just want to thank you for it well thanks so much for saying that and yeah that is the reason you know I just feel really connected to that vision and you know I another one of my favorite sayings is from Bishop Desmond Tutu the legendary South African Bishop and I don't don't remember the full sentence but it was something to the effect that a lot of people don't believe in the possibility of possibility and that that's what we need is you have to believe in the possibility of possibility and then to my mind you know the the ego and whatever it is can cook up all kinds of stories about what's going on but there's only one attitude that's functional and that is to believe in the possibility of possibility and do what you need to do your own healing work and participating whatever you can do yeah yeah yeah I think so you know so it's a wonderful vision it's a wonderful prayer and excuse me do you want to say anything is there can people contact you or is there anything to say about that well actually I I'm embarrassed that I haven't gotten my website finished yet I hopefully it will be up in a month or so it will be crisp acecomm will be where people will be able to find me online right now they can find me if they go to my articles and publications if they go to academia.edu and sign in there they'll be able to find me under Chris M beige and everything that I've written and many of the podcasts are there but Chris Bosh calm soon will be where people can reach me and they can also reach me at my university webs my address cm beige @ y su dot edu I should be able to put little tabs up on the screen at some point yeah show those four people and in the meantime just so they know well I think maybe it's showing on the screen it does on mine when I'm speaking and when you're speaking but it's pretty or me spelled ba CH e yes it's not necessarily an intuitive spelling and pronunciation man yeah yeah so again the book that we're talking about more than any you know he's got other works as I mentioned at the beginning is this one it's it's incredible it's really remarkable and there's so much more in this book that we didn't cover today so I hope people will go and find this book it's going to be it already is and will continue to be part of this kind of transformation that we're talking about so yeah I guess Thank You Steven thank you for the conversation thank you for the opportunity to bring these ideas forward to your listeners you do it so well Chris really you know I I know you're humble about it but you know I could listen to you all day you really have them you know you're in you're doing the right job you know if you found your job I think because you explained it so so clearly so again thank you very much and I'll just say well you're still here because I haven't like I say I haven't figured it out quite you know how I want to end these things I'll just say that I'm hoping to be able to put a little subscribe button up on here and I hope people will subscribe to this YouTube channel and share it and so on and it'll also be on anchor which is an audio podcast I hope well once I figure it I will strip the audio off off the video and put it on anchor as well so again much much thanks from the heart Chris night care bye bye my friend you</p>

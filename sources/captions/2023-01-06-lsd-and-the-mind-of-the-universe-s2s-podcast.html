      <p>[Music] thank you welcome to the secret to secret podcast my name is Simeon and it's my honor to introduce to you today our first ever guest on the podcast Dr Christopher M bish is professor emeritus at the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years his work explores the philosophical complications of non-ordinary states of Consciousness particularly psychedelic States he has authored four books his latest one being LSD and the mind of the universe or as Chris prefers to call it diamonds from heaven in diamonds from heaven Chris combines his expert knowledge of the world's wisdom Traditions with the insights he personally gained from 20 years of intense high-dose psychedelic work undertaking in secrecy and um the cosmic plan that revealed itself to Chris is both astonishing and beautiful and Carries great implications about the way we should understand our individual and our Collective existence Chris and I split our conversation neatly into two parts so in the first half of the podcast you can get some more details on the general areas that Chris's work focuses on and the general chronology of his work but if you're familiar with Chris's work feel free to skip ahead halfway where we delve into issues that Chris hasn't spoken about in length before such as the nature of suffering and Evil and also how reincarnation and the non-self can both be true at the same time one final note please bear with me as I get this podcast up and running I know that video quality and audio quality on my end are pretty bad but um I promise better quality in the future and fortunately Chris does most of the talking here so it shouldn't be too much of a issue I hope the beautiful conversation Chris and I had brings you Joy and wisdom same as it brought me and I hope you enjoy thank you for watching good so uh so to begin would you like to kind of give a general overview of your work that kind of you talked about in the book what the book is about and what your experiences really were yeah well it all began right after I finished graduate school in 1978 I had started I started my career as a professor of religious studies at Youngstown State University in Ohio and I read Stan Groff's first book Realms of the human unconscious and I knew immediately that this was critically important work to my discipline which was philosophy of religion and Stan outlined a methodology that allowed us to enter systematically and carefully and unsafely into these deep States Of Consciousness in which we could not only heal but explore the deepest levels of our mind and entering into those levels dropping into deeper levels of consciousness that went beyond individual mind so that excited me very much as a young philosopher I thought this was great this is a whole new philosophical method so I began to do this work and to do it of course since it was illegal at the time I had to make a choice and I don't like doing things illegal but I made a choice to divide myself in half and in my daytime job for the next 33 years I was a professor of religious studies at Youngstown State University teaching courses and doing the things that people do and then my nighttime job I began the systematic journey into deep non-ordinary States Of Consciousness using LSD and I used LSD because that was the substance that Stan had worked with in his early years that's what his research was based on primarily and I trusted what I saw in his work uh so I used that and after my sessions my work was always following the protocols that he laid out in his early book LSD psychotherapy they were always protected from the world they were always private I worked with a sitter I was always lying down with carefully choreographed music pacing the stages of opening and closing in the sessions and I made a very careful and sustained effort to record each session faithfully and completely after the session was over so I began this work I did it intensely for four years and then for reasons that I describe in the book I stopped the work for six years and then I resumed it for another 10 years of work I started in 1979 and I finished it in 1999. I did 73 high dose sessions over this 20-year period I started with three medium dose sessions and then went into all the rest of my sessions were high dose sessions which I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms which is a protocol that I don't recommend I don't recommend such a a long sustained hammering of the boundaries of Consciousness exploding so relentlessly into these this work I would work much differently if I did it again today I would work more slowly I would alternate high doses with low doses and I would work I would balance LSD with more body grounded or psychedelics such as psilocybin in ayahuasca but what happened on the journey basically is that I went through not just one death not just ego death but the universe took me in gradually through multiple layers of reality deeper and deeper through deeper levels of consciousness and I found that entering deeper levels of consciousness and therefore and through them accessing deeper levels of reality required going through a series of deaths dying at one level of Consciousness to enter a deeper level of Consciousness and then mastering or learning the ins and outs of that level and then going through yet another death to enter in a yet a still deeper level of consciousness so when I got to the end of the journey and was looking at all of the years of work I basically asked myself how many fundamental levels of reality did I experience or how many cycles of death and rebirth and I I came up with five there was a level that took place at the level of collective excuse me personal mind ego death then there was a level that took place at the level of collective mind the collective mind of our species then there was a level that took place at archetypal mind and then the level of causal reality the level of Oneness and then in the five last years of my work uh the level of diamond Luminosity what I call Diamond luminosity uh what Buddhism calls the absolute of the absolute the clear light of absolute reality so after I finished my sessions uh spirit said to me in my meditation 20 years in 20 years out and I took that at the time to mean that it would take me 20 years to fully assimilate and integrate 20 years of my sessions as it turned out LST in the mind of the universe or as I prefer to call it diamonds from heaven was published exactly 20 years after I finished my sessions so there was 20 years of exploration followed by 20 years of digesting reflecting integrating and finally telling the story of this journey and I share it in the hope that it will be useful to other people both people who are journeyers but also people who are not journeyers who are involved in spiritual practices other than psychedelics because of the I hope the cosmology that emerges in the story and the understanding of some of the cosmological processes that we're all engaged in will be useful to people yes well uh yeah your work is definitely fascinating and um well one thing I think that is very important to address whenever somebody is talking about psychedelic States and insights that arise from them I think the the go-to argument of the skeptic is these are states that appear while the mind is under the influence of a substance therefore why should the any insights game be legitimate but even to take this argument further when you are exploring um but when you're having your experiences under the the influence of these substances how do you know what you are studying how do you know what you're seeing is this the cosmos is this your personal psyche what is it that you are experiencing yeah really an important question isn't it can we trust what emerges in our awareness in psychedelic states of awareness well I took my starting point from Stan's observations and many other psychedelic therapists in the early years and that is an understanding that psychedelics don't give you an experience what they simply do is amplify your own Consciousness they are an amplifier and a catalyst of your own mind and if you use these hours of Amplified awareness carefully if you focus them and internalize them and keep your vision focused on the stream of awareness that's arising within you you begin a process of purification and a process of confrontation with the different blocks and pains and things we'd rather not look at in our daily life your system just spontaneously moves to eliminate those challenges which are lodged in our history sometimes our history from Justice lifetime sometimes our history from former lifetimes in the early stages we know that we can judge the legitimacy of what's a what we are experiencing because these are activating memories from our lifetime we can verify those memories we can explore them they have the texture of memory and when we confront the pains that arise there is a liberating experience there is a healing experience which has demonstrable impacts on our daily life after a session has ended so there's a tremendous sense of verification of the truth of what one is encountering and that tends to give confidence that when one moves Beyond The Familiar when one moves beyond the domain of one's immediate life that there is a truth also in these experiences even though they're coming from a more foreign level of Consciousness this process repeats itself so one enters into a reality which is completely foreign unknown strange and at first maybe what stands out is its strangeness but the more frequently you go back into that reality the more you become familiar with its landscape in my experience is that if you engage these hours carefully and if you record them and re and work hard to retain them listen to what it's teaching you the universe enters into a dialogue with you it's like now it knows you're paying attention and so it's speaking to you and it takes you through an educational process it takes you through a series of of lessons about how reality works here uh what's going on at this level of reality and in the early stages there are certain qualities that relate to your personal life maybe uh you experience your personal life in a larger in a larger spiritual trajectory you may have insights into former lives you may have insights into your deeper former life history that clarifies and heals relationships in your present life and because these have such a dramatic impact on our present life once again their legitimacy is confirmed in your own life experience and as one goes deeper into Collective mind into archetypal reality into deeper into spiritual reality in this case I had I was fortunate in that I had a PhD in philosophy of religion I had a lot of opportunity to study some of the great spiritual traditions of the world so I was familiar with some of the ins and outs of spiritual practice as cells have been developed in different countries I had an understanding of their maps of what lies in the spiritual world and so I had a reference point to compare my experiences in psychedelic states with the experiences that other spiritual Seekers were having in their Traditions using meditation methods yogic methods or psychedelic methods to explore reality from across the world now I've always taken a Global Perspective and I teach I taught intro to world religions for years I taught courses on comparative mysticism I've always found that the deepest patterns that emerge or for me the most interesting patterns are the patterns that emerge not simply in one culture in one spiritual tradition but in multiple Traditions looked at simultaneously and when you can hold the world spiritual traditions in your Consciousness all at the same time then you begin to see patterns that connect the different lineages into larger holes and I found that my psychedelic experiences fit comfortably within that larger landscape and I I have to qualify because it fit comfortably and yet as I went deeper it also pushed the boundaries of those experiences and took me deeper but I guess in addition to this sort of personal verification and then Collective Global spiritual correspondence which is a kind of verification there is an experiential quality to these experiences uh you pay a great price to enter into these states you must go through multiple multiple cycles of purification detoxification confrontation with your own limitations layer after layer in order to enter into clear states of perception clear states of awareness these states of awareness have equality where it's just transparently clear that you are experiencing something real something genuine it doesn't mean necessarily that you're seeing all that exists or everything that's there or that's not that there can't be limitations or distortions in your experience but you know you are confronting something which is just as real is what you confront in time space reality so in this dialogue in this dance my conviction grew that I was on a journey a journey that had philosophical value a journey that was producing genuine insights into how our universe works the structure of the universe doesn't mean that everything I saw is necessarily perfectly correct but there is a fundamental conviction that these are real that these are valuable and they're shared by other persons if I were only my experiences then maybe they would just be a solipsistic fantasy but by comparing your experiences to the experiences of other psychedelic explorers and in this respect Stan Groff's compendium of so many hundreds and thousands of psychedelic journeyers and their experiences gave me confidence that what I was experiencing was not simply a personal illusion or a personal fantasy but was flowing in accord with what other psychedelic journeyers had experienced and then by comparing them to the cosmologies of meditation traditions it gave me confidence that psychedelics were not psychedelics were just a key that were giving us access to states of awareness which are Universal and you can get access to these states using other methods as well I see so and you began your work with the motivation to explore the universe as a philosopher is that correct yeah that was my intention I'm not a therapist I wasn't I mean I've received much healing in this work and always grateful for it but that was not my primary intention I was trained as a philosopher of religion I wanted to explore the universe as deeply as I could and understand not only my nature but understand the larger landscape of the universe and and you're saying that despite the fact so the fact that your experiences fit in kind of the larger body of religious and philosophical traditions we have as a species gave you confidence that what you're experiencing is genuine but at the same time you also push the boundary in terms of seeing things that you had not encountered before and elsewhere so uh keeping this in mind do you believe that psychedelics um offer the promise of new insights that we can gain philosophically and spiritually that we have not uncovered before how GC psychedelics is fitting in to the Future development of philosophy and spirituality of our species yeah well this this is an exciting time and exciting territory uh I became convinced early on that psychedelics represented a true before and after development in philosophical reflection because in philosophical reflection in one way or another we are always reflecting upon the breadth of Human Experience not only our own experience but other people's experiences and we here have an opportunity to temporarily deepen our Consciousness deepen our awareness and push the boundaries of awareness and I think this opens up not only individual selective insights into the nature of Consciousness but it also opens up the possibility of an entire new method of exploration which was first articulated I think by William jakewell in modern times it there are ancient prototypes of this work in the ellessinian mystery schools and and the Ayahuasca churches of Brazil but in Western philosophy probably first articulated by William James and that is a systematic rhythm of expanding consciousness experiencing what you can experience coming back recording it evaluating it comparing it to other bodies of knowledge comparing it to other people's experiences and then expanding again going out again coming back same process writing it down this rhythm of expansion and then evaluation expansion and evaluation I think opens up the possibility it allows us to explore dimensions of Consciousness that are for the most part for most people unless they have our lifelong spiritual practitioners of some of the meditative arts for most people these dimensions of consciousness are invisible they just lie outside the purview of their awareness but by systematically entering into these temporary States we can explore them we can taste them we can sample them and we can gather insights about how the universe is working because we find that all the awareness all the intelligence all the compassion which is inside us is not something which has been assembled my mechanical chances by mechanical processes which are driven by random variation as of the modern mind thinks but we find that our mind opens into an infinite mind something which is ultimately an infinite mind it opens up into the species mind the collective unconscious of our species into deeper and deeper levels beyond the species and ultimately into the mind which is the generative mind of the universe itself at least that's my experience now philosophically we've been talking about that mine for years even in denying its existence if you choose the atheistic alternative but we've been wanting to know about we've been asking questions about our larger place and the cosmos whether there is meaning in our lives whether there is intention in The evolutionary project what the hell is going on why does life hurt so much why is there so much suffering these are core philosophical questions that in the modern mind many philosophers have just abandoned and just said they're unanswerable we can't know so we're going to change the topic of discussion but still as long as we live we want to know the answer to these questions psychedelics I think give us an opportunity to systematically and rigorously engage these questions and that's a turning point because ideally for example I think we would want to take a hundred people say the best educated people most creative people with phds and multiple disciplines and then go through the same systematic regimen of disclosure encounter and then compare the notes of all these people and see what is the collective patterns that they're what is the common ground that they see and recognize this tokens I think this is what's beginning to happen this is what we're doing this is what we will be doing for hundreds of years and this is a turning point philosophy this really marks a difference between old philosophy which was done on the basis of just sensory Consciousness and a new philosophy which is done on the basis of this new technology this new technology of encounter mm-hmm that's that's really momentous changes that seem to be coming within the Psychedelic Renaissance which seems to be happening at the moment um but for for our viewers that in your book you have a really nice section where you um describe a day in the life of a few doing your psychedelic session um for those of our listeners and viewers that are not aware of it would you go through it and tell us what your protocols really were and how a typical session they would go well there's a chapter in the book um basically a session day because some of the readers early readers of the manuscript asked me to do just this to kind of take him into a typical day so here's a typical day all my sessions took place in my house or in my wife's um therapeutic office they always began in the early morning I was always I would begin with meditation or yoga or some type of centering practice to get myself centered and the more I worked with these states the more important I paid to more parts I've understood was the preparation not only the preparation of sentence setting which is well appreciated today but a lot of attention to my emotional state and my physical state a lot of practices uh purifying my body making sure that my literally my physical bone structure was aligned because when you enter into these states if you are not really um balanced open pores in in good condition you can get into all into various complications and energy gets jammed up in your body but the dates they would start early morning I would um go through my practice and then my sitter for all the 20 years of my work was my first wife Carol who was a clinical psychologist and uh basically after these early preparations I would take the Psychedelic and then I would turn over responsibility to my condition to urge and my protection she would take care of me she would make sure I was safe she would make sure that I would stay focused inwardly that I would not allow myself to get distracted or act out in any dangerous way I for the most part because I was working with very high doses of LSD there was no verbal interaction I was listening to music she was the curator of the music responsible for intuiting when to shift from one stage to another there are certain stages in a psychedelic session I would basically do the work as long as it lasted which is usually six to eight hours she was with me the whole time making sure I was safe until I was back and consolidating uh and then I would spend that evening uh reflecting on the sessions thinking about it trying to put together the first map of what had happened in the sessions and often I didn't sleep much the day after a session uh but the next day it was always a priority to make a written account of the session and when you're entering really foreign territory making an accurate written record can be challenging now some people who have artistic abilities can draw them or paint them Alex Gray's work such wonderful work other psychedelic artists I don't have those skills so for me it was making a written record and in order to learn how to capture experiences that are so Elusive and so far beyond our ordinary way of knowing I developed a technique I called it standing at the edge of the well the day after a session you're still porous around the edges but your verbal and cognitive functions have returned so what I would do is I would play the music that was used in this session in exactly the same order that it had been played in the session and I would get back into the mood or the psychological space of the that I was in when this music was being played and from that condition one foot in the session one foot out I would write up that portion of the experience and when I was done with that I'd shift to the next piece of music and play it over and over until I had captured as best as I could what had been happening during that music and when I was done I had my draft of the session once I had that draft I locked it I didn't change it I learned that by trying sometimes trying to improve the text or make it a little more polished that you lose something that is contained in the original raw language so once I had that text I locked it uh yeah and then I would spend weeks months sometimes uh basically studying the sessions trying to understand it put it in the context of previous sessions on average I was doing about five sessions a year that's kind of a statistically that's what it worked out so I had plenty of time in between my sessions to digest and assimilate them and I was also doing spiritual practice during this time I was always meditating so the day after a session always began with meditation which is a nice spacious place to be able to open up and just let the energy that had been running in you during a session flow uh in you in your meditative space so that's basically what a session looked like I would not eat anything but for breakfast always an empty stomach because I would throw up often because you know people don't think you throw up on LSD but you do you know this is it's one of the symptoms of Shifting states of energy it's your body has some challenge adjusting to these more intense States and I would eat something light at the very end of the day there's so many things I'm curious about your particular approach but one thing in particular for me is music I want to ask you about the way you use music because music and psychedelics have always had a very special relationship I think and there have been different approaches so for example Terence mechanics famous for saying five Drive grams in silent darkness that was his recommendation and he he once famously joked that if you come out of a psychedelic session saying Buck was a genius well you know everybody knows that so his approach rather was to kind of let the experience take you where it takes you but you were as I read in your book were very particular in the your choice of music and it changed as you progressed in your in your work there was also one very funny moment in which your your sitter put on the the wrong piece of music but this this actually helped you get out of a very kind of difficult situation so yes what's your approach with music well music does influence our experience and and I do value um working without music I mean I I've continued to work with psychedelics after stopping my high-dose LSD work but and during this post LSD work I often will just enter into meditative space with psilocybin or ayahuasca and in the Psychedelic work itself in the late years in the late sessions I would often end the music in the second half of the session and just move into meditative space but basically I followed the protocol that was kind of laid out in the early psychedelic research in the understanding here is not that music gives you experiences but that music can support the underlying immersion of your unconscious into your awareness so it just kind of provides a a background that makes it easier for you to detach from the habits of your mind and to go with the flow as it were into what emerges is emerging so I I think it of it as supporting and reinforcing what happens when you do go simply into the dark without any music at all and we know that there are stages of the LSD experience there's a it takes so many minutes for it to begin to become active it builds in potency again you have to look carefully at the Psychedelic you're using the the curve of activation on it the depth of activation um it's different if you're working with low doses of LSD than if you're working with high doses of LSD working as I did with high dose levels there was a tremendous acceleration of Consciousness a tremendous speed with which your body and your mind is adjusting to the extraordinary increase of energy and and awareness as you begin to break through the bounds of personal Consciousness and so they're Helen Bonnie's early work on the stages of psychedelic of a psychedelic session and the type of music that supports that session so I followed those early guidelines which have been further expanded in the holotropic breathwork network which has a good large library of musical recommendations I found I I came across early on in about 12 by about the fifth or sixth or seventh session I Came Upon some indigenous chanting types of indigenous chanting and I found that that music had a much more powerful impact on my on my experiences than listening to classical music even New pieces of classical music and and I did listen to Lots but they still kept within conventional they kind of kept within a more conventional framework and I found that indigenous music that was foreign that was unknown that I didn't understand the words of and they had a a more of a cathartic opening effect in my Consciousness so I found it very useful and I began to collect all manner of indigenous music and different cultures from around the world and I Incorporated them into my sessions and then when you are at Peak when you've gone through you've ever gone through the purification or the death process and you've transitioned into deeper uh ecstatic reality into Visionary States uh you want music which is more expansive which is kind of gives your mind room to work so to speak just very very expansive and then as you begin the long slow descent uh LSD has a long tail so that's a long slow process which is really one of the nice advantages of LLC it gives you time inside the session to integrate reflect upon to compose yourself with respect to the experiences that you've just had so you want long gentle gentle expansive uh music in all of the work until the very end uh you don't want any words in English or any words in your native language words which you can understand because you don't want them to script your experience best to uh well I found that I would only really could use Music three times before I had to let it go for the most part because by the time you've used music several times it tends to get saturated with the experiences that you had with that music so when you listen to the music it tends to take you back into where you were before not where you are now so I would really limit myself to using music only a few times and then I had to find new music when you're in the downward slope when you're coming back into your more familiar life then that applies less I am more comfortable using more familiar music in the spacious return okay I see um also well another thing about your sessions also I think which a person who is not familiar with your work and who is not familiar with the Psychedelic work at all would think okay here is this person he's having this Visionary experiences it's all very nice and very interesting and he's writing about them so it must be very exciting very pleasant work but I think anybody a little bit familiar with the Psychedelic experience would know that these are especially hide those experiences are very uh difficult experiences to go through so some especially I know that your initial sessions you write about them they were very expensive very exciting but as time went on uh they became more and more difficult and difficult times started appearing more often and they were harder to go through so at some point I'm sure it was difficult for you to uh to kind of go through it again knowing what's probably waiting for you that it's going to be a day of really difficult experiences so um so in the light of this how did you work with daily spiritual practice to help you prepare for this and also not only for this but also to kind of incorporate um your insights into your daily life because as you've said previously the Psychedelic experiences we cannot hold on to them so we need to find ways to integrate them yeah well let me try to hold on to two parts to your question first of all um the method of working with high dose LSD and then issues of the challenges that come up and the three things the challenges that come up in high dose work and third integrating those experiences into daily life so if I get lost in my answer you bring me back to those three okay uh Stan's early work differentiated very clearly between low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy low-dose psycholytic therapy is kind of much more similar to what is being done today the goal here is to amplify Consciousness but not but do it in a way where the unconscious unfolds itself gradually layer by layer taking us systematically kind of more less traumatically into the inner confrontation that heals their psychedelic work was very different and what stands out in my mind is their work at the Spring Grove Hospital in Maryland where they were basically working with a different population they were working with terminally ill cancer patients so they were working with people who were going to die and they were trying to trigger an encounter with Cosmic reality they were trying to trigger essentially an nde a near-death experience that would give them a foretaste of where they were going when they died uh and they this protocol limited high-dose sessions to three sessions no more than three sessions so this is a very different protocol it wasn't really trying to heal all the layers of personal issues it was trying to blow through the personal unconscious and go into Cosmic reality just to get a taste to get a sample so I thought well if you could do that three times you can do it more than three times and just just go for it let's just go for it and see how deeply we can go and in doing that I found it took me about two years of work about 10 sessions to basically go through what Stan calls the perinatal level of Consciousness where I lived my birth and relive various very strong physical emotional confrontations existential crises questioning the meaning of existence the meaningfulness the futility of Life all the things one goes through and those initial and early experiences and then I went through kind of a classic ego death experience where my my individual identity was shattered it was turned inside out I was forced to become the exact opposite of everything I knew myself to be and in that process Chris bash's life Chris basia's historical existence ceased to be the container of my Consciousness I just moved into a more expansive awareness beyond the historicity of crispacia's life as I went deeper I began to experience a very very different order of challenges that were not personal I began to be systematically taken into vast territories of pain and suffering violence and wars and just brutal uh is like Dante's Inferno except many times worse uh and this was much harder than experiencing my the doubts of metaphysical anxiety or the you know my personal ego death this was something different um but here's the thing I would spend hours in this condition and it was difficult and going back into it to the next session I had to really steal myself to prepare myself to enter into this domain once I knew that it was coming but I would spend a couple of hours or a few hours in this process and then it would reach a crescendo and it would spin me out into the Visionary state it would spin me out into the ecstatic Visionary state and when that happens the pain of the very intense pain of the ocean of suffering was balanced and proportioned to the great ecstatic joy that followed in the ecstatic portion of those sessions so when you understand this cycle when you understand the pattern that there will be this very intense period of pain in some form or another but this is going to be followed by an even deeper immersion into ecstatic Visionary experience you you uh it's not just that the sessions become pain-filled there is a new layer of pain but there's also a new layer of insight and ecstasy and joy and that's what gives you the strength to return and keep coming back to these states and that tremendous sense of uh ecstatic Visionary encounter cosmological inquiry and so as I went at the the ocean of suffering lasted two more years and I went through that level and then I went through yet another death rebirth process and then came into another deeper level of Consciousness archetypal reality and moving deep into the collective psyche and archetypal psyche and then going through yet another death and rebirth went into the Ecstasy of Oneness the Ecstasy of calls or reality for an entire year just experience after experience of different levels of uh [Music] of Oneness parameters of Oneness so the challenge does increase but the payoff also increases as you go deeper so it's um I've always considered that trade-off a good exchange I've always been a volunteer in this process nothing was done to me I always was willing to go there and the rewards that I was given for the engagement uh always made it worthwhile I wouldn't trade these 73 days for anything any of the Treasures of the world that's beautiful um about the Psychedelic work one thing that I've noticed is that they psychedelic work parallels in a certain way just what people with code normal uh spiritual daily practice so let's say if somebody reads your book but entirely forgets the fact that you were entering into psychedelic States they could read it as a report of a person going through intense daily meditation practice let's say because I think these cycles of purification and then expanses insight and and Bliss appear in the normal space of Consciousness so in in a merge in a much kind of smaller scale but I think there's essentially a mirroring almost fractal like uh parallels between psychedelic States and real life yes and kind of why I'm really interested into how you've used uh daily spiritual practice is because I um essentially think that they shouldn't re they should be discontinuity between daily practice and psychedelics is very important I think because uh ramdas used to say that you know going on an LSD trip is like being with Buddha or Jesus in the room for two hours but then you have to leave and then the artist is kind of staying in that room for as long as you can without any assessment so what what are your views on that yeah well I completely agree with you that there's nothing unique uh about psychedelic experiences because they are amplifiers of Consciousness so it's Consciousness that does the work in the end uh it's not psychedelics that do any unique work it's Consciousness I've had many readers write me and say you know I've never taken a psychedelic in my life but I completely relate to what you're describing it mirrors my own experience in terms of these breakthroughs and levels or this particular part of the experience so I know we know that there is a profound overlap and continuity between our work in ordinary spiritual let's say non-psychedelic spiritual practice and psychedelic spiritual practice and it's more than just that I mean basically in order to understand what happens in psychedelic sessions we have to have an understanding of what's happening in life what how life works now for me reincarnation is just a fact of existence you know that's my first book was on reincarnation and I consider the empirical evidence supporting a reincarnational worldview is just overwhelming at this point it doesn't mean that we understand how it all works all the details of it but that there is a continuity arcing through multiple lifetimes in a larger developmental evolutionary process is really important to understand so in order to understand this rhythm of where we are we die and we our Consciousness gets large into the soul territory we incarnate and we get small and focused and we die and we get large and we incarnate we get small in focus and we keep going back back and forth and it's like every time we incarnate we choose a certain set of issues we choose a certain set of of challenges that we face and confront and as we face and confront those things our life develops it you know sometimes we don't do so well we flunk the course other times we do very well we're passed and moved on and this Rhythm uh shows itself inside every life and across multiple lives when we are when we go through if we look at long strings of our of lives that's in past life therapy or that type of work and in this sense I think what LSD what any spiritual practice does and psychedelic spiritual practice does is that it accelerates this process we're reincarnation moves very slowly and grinds very finely but if you want to speed up the process you can turn awareness back onto itself and look at where awareness is coming from examine and engage their challenges that you are facing in the outer World in their core nuclear form when they exist as thought forms within your Consciousness if you don't do that they will eventually these thought forms will manifest as your outer physical reality but if and and you'll learn from them but if you speed up that want to speed up the process you can look at them in their nuclear form and engage them before they manifest in the physical world this happens in spiritual practice in meditative practice and it also happens in psychedelic practice so I completely agree with you the more I've worked with psychedelics the more I'm convinced that if you want to open yourself up to these temporary States Of Consciousness it's very important to be practicing have a daily spiritual practice in fact the deeper the State of Consciousness you enter temporarily the stronger should be your daily practice because when you open to these vast fields of energy these vast territories of Consciousness it places tremendous challenges it make it tremendous strains in a way not only on your mind but on your body on your subtle Energy System and it's really important I think to bring those experiences into a daily spiritual practice so that your the conditions you move into in your spiritual practice in your daily practice give you the greater capacity to absorb and integrate and to navigate not only the insights but the the experiences that immerse in your psychedelic States in my psychedelic States I was given many practices I was given not just teachings and experiences but I was basically told do this do that you know I was given practices and I would take those practices into my daily spiritual practice in the last five years of my work and there's a I discussed this in the diamond Luminosity chapter I entered into um vadriana Buddhism I had always been a meditator but I began a more formal relationship with vodriana teachers and I began to practice within this Buddhist Tibetan Buddhist tradition and I found this was very helpful for where I was working at the time because I was working at that time in very very pure and very intense states of awareness Diamond luminosity and I was finding that it wasn't getting increasingly difficult for this for my subtle Energy System to sustain the encounter with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness and when I began to do these ancient practices when I began to do should in the various deity practices of Adriana I found that my physical and psychological and subtle energy systems were able to breathe more freely it was like my vadriana practice gave me a space to enter that was midway between my physical Consciousness and my psychedelic Consciousness and by entering those States I was able to breathe and flow the energy that came into my psychedelic sessions I could I could channel that energy I could it just kind of moved more freely it gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and my mind to sort of breathe more comfortably this was very helpful at the time so I completely agree with you I mean the most important thing I think to remember about psychedelics in terms of spiritual practices you can't take a psychedelic when you die when you die you go into the universe you're all on your own the mind you take is the mind you got so knowing that everything you do in your psychedelic work should be preparing yourself for that final encounter when you let go of the body and you enter into that world you can't take psychedelics when you're dead now I think psychedelics can give us can teach us a lot about where we're going it can prepare the soul for where it's going so that territory which may strike us as kind of strange and intimidating for an ordinary person when they die we can encounter it as you know just a familiar route that we've traveled multiple times before in our psychedelic sessions so I I don't I understand the tension for some teachers of classical meditation and their criticism of psychedelics as kind of a false spirituality or um distracting experiences I understand that but for me I've never found it to be an incompatible approach to spiritual a deepening spiritual experience it's not the same it does open up different types of experiences but if you understand spiritual practice if you understand how spirituality what spirituality is I think that's spiritual that psychedelic work can reinforce and accelerate our daily spiritual practice in ways that are really very beneficial yes I I agree with that and also myself I'm very interested in how one can achieve synergies between between the two um now in in this last answer that you gave you already touched upon some of the kind of uh deeper territories of your work so I'm wondering whether you'd like to move into this and discuss the the the the the cosmic blueprint that was revealed to you uh during your work um one one of the one of the things that you talk about is reincarnation and I find this very interesting uh reading you reading your book uh gave me kind of almost a permission to be interested intellectually interested in in reincarnation and not to be shy about it and you your work has really made me consider incarnation in a serious way for the first time and kind of discuss it with other people um so you mentioned a number of books a number of authors and in fact it's kind of a large literature that exists that has documented cases that are suggested for reincarnation um so I was curious what has convinced you of reincarnation in your reading and in your personal experience yeah well when I began my teaching at Youngstown State I told you that Stan Groff was a major turning point in my life but there was another author who was also a major turning point and this is Dr Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia and uh he's passed on now but the work continues at Virginia and he had spent a lifetime he and his team studying children from around the world different cultures different religious backgrounds or non-religious backgrounds children who as soon as they begin to be able to talk when they're two years old they begin to speak very matter-of-factly about their other life that they remember having lived they describe people in places and events they often have a very powerful emotional attachment to that previous life they will run away from home sometimes just to return to the family that they knew in their previous life so Stevenson has studied thousands of cases like this and he's published hundreds of cases most of the cases he studied do not meet the highest levels of rigor required for verification and publication but an amazing number of courses do allow themselves to be verified so when I read his book 20 cases suggestive of reincarnation it just it absolutely showed me something that I had never encountered in graduate school never in any in my studies that reincarnation is a simple fact of life these children who know things that they shouldn't know that we can reasonably exclude other possibilities that they could have come through this knowledge through normal or physical channels their parents talking or their neighbors talking or something they saw on television or in a newspaper that we can reasonably eliminate those possibilities and we have to confront the fact that these children know things that other people that about other people's lives and have an emotional attachment and identification with what with that knowledge that seems clearly to indicate that there is continuity between the life experience of that previous life and their present life and at the end of his career Stevenson publishes Monument Opus in which he demonstrated not only that our memories continuous but in some cases even our bodies bear the marks of events that took place in our previous lifetime that children he he studied 187 cases of children who had birthmarks are pigmentation are seeming scars on their body that reflected the death circumstances of previous life so someone who was stabbed in a previous life and they have a memory of that life had a birthmark where they were stabbed in a way that replicated that are someone who was hung had scars on their neck that seemed to correlate it's an absolutely fascinating study and from there once I was convinced by Stevenson's research that reincarnation was simply part of life I went on to study the work of multiple past life therapists who were working with their clients to heal the wounds of their present life most of the time when you work in therapy the wounds of your present life go back to some trauma or some disruption some unhappiness from our present life earlier in our life but he past life therapists consistently find that there's a certain percentage of pains which are not healed when you go back to your farm to your present life but when you allow your mind to open into your deeper history then all of a sudden you are reliving a deeper story you are remembering things that happened when you were a different person than you are now but you remember them with the same sense of identification and self-sense that you have for your present life and when people do this when they go back and relive the pains and the trauma or the conflicts that were present in their previous life it has a healing effect on their present life and after reading hundreds of cases like this it just became more and more obvious to me that reincarnation is part of the larger rhythm of our life it doesn't mean I agreed with all the interpretations of reincarnation in fact that's one of the things that came up in my sessions was an expansion of the model of what's taking place in reincarnation but the fact of reincarnation the fact that one life rolls into another life rolls into another life with time in between I mean Michael Newton's work um a past life therapist life between life his book's journey of the Soul uh journeys of the soul and Destiny of souls has done fascinating work he was doing conventional kind of past life regression therapy and he he made a mistake one day in one of his with one of his clients he gave an ambiguous instruction and suddenly he realized that his patients were described his patient was describing what happened to them after they died in the former life they had been reliving so he discovered that people had the capacity not only to remember their former lives but to remember what they were doing in between their incarnate lives and so he after he had regressed just hundreds of people back into this in between State he began to write a series of books journeys of the journeys of the Soul journey of Souls and Destiny of souls in which he basically compiled what his clients were telling him about the interlife state and in there it becomes it's part of his discovery that people choose consciously their present the conditions of their present life that there is a process when you die there is a debriefing process a process of integrating back into the soul integrating into the world of spirit a process of maybe healing some of the unhappinesses that have been collected in your present lifetime but then there is a period of refreshment and restoration and learning continues and there is a social structure to the the post-mortem condition but there comes a time when it's time for class to resume it's the soul begins a process of choosing the conditions of its next incarnation this is that that basic that's really opens up a whole new understanding in this sense uh no I think that just as kids and people in college some people choose their courses very carefully and systematically with great forethought and some people choose their courses kind of haphazardly or randomly just picking what comes what works in their work schedule and they get different results I think it may be also the case for the soul some Souls choose more carefully than other Souls but the idea that we choose our Incarnation we choose the circumstances of our Incarnation that it's an intelligent process and by making choices of what we want to experience doing our best in that experience expanding out by becoming male female Rich poor Warrior priests artists all these different varieties we grow faster than we would grow if we lived all these years as one person the same person so sometimes with my students I would say imagine that you're the creative intelligence of the universe and you had two options you could create a life that would live a hundred thousand years or you could create a life that would live the same hundred thousand years but in Hundred Year increments and every hundred years they would change the circumstances of the life at the end of a hundred years which do you think would produce the greater learning and I think it's clear that the Hundred Year increment life would produce the greater learning that's understanding that underneath the short-term experience of our present life there is an accumulation taking place at the level of the soul that the soul is learning the soul is accumulating the experiences of all of our many many lifetimes and they aren't that learning is not necessarily present in each individual life but it's holding them like a library uh in the spiritual reality now this was I saw this also in my sessions I I experienced in some cases former lives with people that I was engaged in in this present lifetime there was healing that took place in these encounters but I also was taken into a series of experiences which pushed the boundaries there was a particular session which I call the birth of the diamond soul in which I experienced all of my former lives coming into me very quick just there was tremendous work had been done earlier in the session and I was in a state where I was just seemingly integrating streams of Consciousness from multiple lifetimes and it was like wrapping string around a kite spool filaments of white light and they seemed to hit a critical mass at one point and when they hit a critical mass they fused all these lives fused into a single energy entity and when they fused there was an explosion of diamond light that it just exploded from my chest and it catapulted me into a completely different state of consciousness I was an individual but I was an individual Beyond any frame of reference that I had previously known I wasn't Chris Bash but I was a being that Chris bash was part of and all of these other farmer lives were part of and this is what I came to call the birth of the diamond soul and it is the idea that life grows that part of the intelligent process of life is growing human consciousness layer by layer semester by semester as it were grade by grade course by course allowing us to expand and grow hopefully more intelligent more compassionate we make mistakes we learn but we learn from those mistakes we grow we grow the process is not simply about becoming incrementally gradually more than we were sooner or later there comes a time when all of those lives all of their learning fuse and the Soul Consciousness awakens within us I think in the normal process of reincarnation we experience our soul when we die so we go from ego to soul back to Ego back to Soul but if we keep this up thousands and thousands of years thousands of years sooner or later it's a natural process that the soul wakes up inside time and space I think this is what's happening not only for us individually but it's what's happening for us as a species we are in the process through our long long history our long evolutionary Journey our long learning process we are in the process of transcending the ego and waking up the soul is waking up inside time and space this is I think history is taking us into a time into an epic when the diamond soul is waking up on Earth that's uh that's beautiful um concerning this vision of reincarnation that you gained uh through your experiences and through your reading there are three particular issues that I two particular questions that I have which I think are very difficult to answer and they arise as many other issues from the fact that it's difficult to talk about these things um but the first issue everybody knows how can reincarnation how can Consciousness travel from one biological mechanism into another but we can leave that alone because it's probably Beyond each one of us at the moment but then two others I think the answer is we don't know yeah no we don't know what the physics of the soul is we don't know how our memories leave our biological base and how Consciousness kind of reprograms or returns to and integrates with the new biological body we just don't have the answer to that question but we won't begin to find the answers to that question and still we start asking different questions we have to open up to a more complex cosmology of a multi-level universe and stop acting as if our Consciousness is being generated and created by our brain that's a reductive cosmology which doesn't allow us to even begin to find the answers to the question you're asking so I hope you're right we don't know but I think in time we'll get more and more knowledge in that area yeah hopefully that's that would be a very interesting thing to realize how it works but also when you talk about the soul that's something that I'm very interested in because let's say if somebody's just doing a meditation practice one of the key insights I think of meditation is non-self non-duality uh the co-arising of of everything so how does that stack up with the idea of a soul reincarnating and what is incriminating is is it the doer that the thing that makes choices in the life or is it the witness the the thing that kind of just is conscious of all these things yeah uh I've had those experiences of non-duality and what Buddhism calls emptiness emptiness of self where there is an experience of such intimacy that there is no self inside you and also no self anywhere in the world everything is just open and pours and magnificent experience and I think it depends on how you think of the Soul if you think of the Soul and I think this is kind of the way we have by habit and by custom have thought of the soul in the past it's kind of what I think of as an atomistic theory of the soul and contrast to a Quantum or field theory of the Soul if you think of the Soul as a fundamentally isolated unit which does not change and is fundamentally isolated from other souls or other beings then you have a problem because non-duality and shunyata Emptiness is cut is it contradicts that atomistic notion of the soul but if you have kind of a Quantum model of the Soul if you have a soul as a field as a as a learning system which is never isolated from the surrounding being surrounded from the surrounding World which is always in an energetic exchange with that world it's always kind of incorporating information and energy for other in the waves of life then I think we can concept understand an understanding of Soul which is one Dynamic it's always changing it's never fixed it's always evolving Through Time and it's porous it's a reality which is porous and yet it has individual like an individuality it has it is I think the the universe is a learning environment it's learning in so many ways it's learning at a at a species level but it's also learning at an individual level we are learning we are growing we are holding on to our experience we remember our experience we acquire insights on the basis of that experience it doesn't mean we're isolated from the world and it doesn't mean we're static but we are developing an individuality which is a porous individuality so in the end I don't think there is any contradiction between affirming an emergent individuality in creation and the fundamental condition of non-duality and I think this is also affirmed in the spiritual Traditions even the Dalai Lama has written that what Buddhism rejects in rejecting it in its anata Doctrine it's no self Doctrine what it's rejecting is not individuality what it's rejecting is a static soul the soul was just in change in time and a soul which is independent of other realities independent of surrounding reality once you want to once you kind of shift your understanding of soul to this kind of open field Vision then I think it's completely compatible with shinyata emptiness and this open field vision of the cell I think it's also kind of leads into your observation that um Enlightenment isn't a private process you were talking about how in particular one thing I found very interesting is you would talk about how your experiences of purification and healing you could see them affecting not only your personal sphere but also the larger Collective of humanity which I found very interesting and I wanted to understand how that how that works and how that feeds into your vision of the future human and yes please tell us a bit more about that oh that's a big question uh you know what I began this work I thought I was doing this work for my personal edification you know from my personal healing maybe even my personal spiritual realization but I found that even though that was maybe my mindset that wasn't the universe's mindset it wasn't what was going on from its end uh the mystery of the collective ramifications of our work the collective import of our work it's only a mystery if we start with the assumption that we are fundamentally private entities but in the nature of the experience both in classical meditative spiritual deepening and in psychedelic spiritual deepening we discover that that's not the case we discover that we are always and forever and always have been always will be part of an interwoven network of life and the image I like to use for this is the image of a tree and a leaf leaf Consciousness and tree Consciousness so imagine you were seeing a tree where all you could see all the leaves and imagine all the leaves were individually conscious they had individual personalities and imagine that everything that was covered in bark was invisible so all you could see were the leaves but you could not see the trunk and the limbs of the tree and imagine that one of these leaves decides to explore what is the real nature of his or her being so he goes deep within and he finds that place in their inner being where they connect to the twig and pushing their Consciousness deeper into the twig into the limb into the branch eventually into the very core of the tree and suddenly has the exploding awareness of what a tree is sees the tree experiences the tree and therefore knows what a leaf is belief is not a separate private part a leaf is a living aspect of a much deeper larger being and that the well-being of the leaf is connected to the well-being of all the other leaves in the tree that we truly are all in this together and when that awareness dawns then if that Consciousness Works its way back up into its Leaf again back into its leafness now it sees all the other leaves in the tree as an aspect of it of this deeper identity which all leaves share it would also say strange things like there is no self it is anata meaning there is no private self we're all here together compassion would spontaneously manifest because you one would know that what you do to another Leaf you do to yourself because you're doing it to the tree we're all individually connected these are things that surface in all deep spiritual traditions in the Psychedelic practice what I found is that when I would open deeply within quote myself I would be involved in healing work and cleansing work that was not related to my personal history but expanded beyond my personal history in some way it would be as if I were working to heal all the leaves on one particular branch of this particular tree and and this just happened spontaneously because nature doesn't hold the boundaries that we imagine exist in our private small mind nature lives as an integrated whole our species lives as an integrated totality so it's just natural that when we open up to that totality as we do with psychedelics we we enter into and we can dissolve completely into that reality so it's not just that the leaf has a leaf experience of the tree the leaf can dissolve into the essence of the tree and experience how the tree experiences life the same thing happens in psychedelic work we enter into purification processes which affect the tree walls around us and we enter into ecstatic Joy ecstatic experiences of intimacy with life intimacy with the Divine which naturally you can't contain it it naturally radiates through your awareness into the awareness of all the beings around you all spiritual Traditions have recognized that our spiritual practice radiates through the fabric of the world not just the human fabric but the fabric of all reality also the the animal fabric of the world so you know I'm getting a little lost in the thought of that it's just it's just it becomes so natural it becomes such a a repeated experience that um it helps me understand in some ways the Buddhist tradition that at the beginning of every meditation session or any spiritual practice You Begin by cultivating what they call bodhichitta which is the desire to save all sentient beings so you open you're doing this practice not for your personal benefit you're doing it for all beings at the end of your practice you give away all the benefit to all the beings of the universe at all the levels so what you're doing is not just for your it's not for your own benefit you're doing it for the benefit of the totality and in doing that you strengthen your awareness that you are fractal aspect of the totality and in that awareness there is great Liberation there is great joy because you know you're you just allow yourself to live and begin to live the larger life and the larger life is what all the spiritual teachers and Saints have been talking about the The Compassion that treats your enemy as as friends The Compassion where you open into deep time and you know that you are more that you are not just the small you which usually takes so much of our time and attention you know that what you are is a piece of life which has infinite extension an infinite range in reach and in that knowledge there is the Great relaxation the great joy you just it dissolves alienation it dissolves loneliness one becomes once again what one has always been but forgets one becomes a joyful aspect of the totality foreign just all the quotes that I have taken from your book and so difficult choosing which one to go with uh but there is one one particular section in which you I'm going to coach you directly um here you talk about kind of the purpose of this whole exercise of reincarnation and learning and um you say you say on the other hand I also felt an Exquisite tenderness coming from the Creator who experienced with us every pain we have taken upon ourselves humans were so precious to the Creator that not a single ounce of pain not single cure was wasted the depth of that Divine care so moved me that no sacrifice seems too large or unreasonable and I think here you're talking about all the suffering that is involved in this process of learning and of a vision in which all this kind of made sense for you as as in it it didn't seem as meaningless suffering anymore um but this reminds me of I don't know if you if you've ever read uh the brothers Karma by Dostoevsky it's a great novel that talks about these issues and at one point there these two brothers and Ivanka and they discussed the existence of God and basically Allah is a faithful kind of servant of God very pure of Hearts but it's not so smart and then there is ivankaramazov who is exceptionally he's essentially a genius uh successful in every manner you can imagine but a complete atheist and when he talks about why he rejects God he gives Pages upon pages of examples of Cruelty inflicted upon children and actually the statistics had taken that out of actual accounts of uh children being tortured being killed being maimed then this is very interesting because it reminds me of your experiences where at a certain point of your journey you were faced by this not just images experiences of children being killed the killing of the children and yes exactly yeah and I think that is really the ultimate argument you can raise against this come what justifies the suffering of innocent beings what can justify this this the suffering because eventually ivank karamazov says perhaps there is a God maybe I do believe in God that I do not accept the world that he has created so what's your comment on this um that is the the hardest part of all of it isn't it uh how can we affirm and intelligence let alone a compassion behind existence operating through existence when everywhere we look around us there is so much pain so much brutality so much horror compounding over and over again so much suffering you know ramakrishna the great Hindu Saint he said if you want to understand God you must be willing to look suffering in the face and I really I hold that and I I really respect that and I think it's really true you you can't you must understand suffering you must confront suffering and engage suffering if you have any hope of understanding the True Divine now I'm really I'm very comfortable with atheism and Atheism is a rejection of theism and depending upon the theism that we're talking about most of the theisms that I know deserve to be rejected most of them are too small most of them are the the gods of so many religions or terrifyingly small and the the vision of life that comes with them are terrifyingly inaccurate in and inadequate uh and do not provide anywhere near an adequate understanding existence to help us understand the enormous pain that we're seeing and I don't think I'm going to be able to succeed and and answering this question satisfactory but it's a question I live with and so I can only offer you a few things foreign the suffering in life we also have to understand genius in life in order to understand what's happening in life's deficiencies children who are born without brains you know without you know we have to understand the larger trajectory of life my sense of it is and my experience it is when I have dissolved into what I experience as the creative intention of the Universe I dissolved into a process of creation a process of manifestations self-manifestation first that was just vast just huge and ancient just extraordinarily old been going on so long billions billions of years 13.8 billion years they tell us since this big bang and we're not at all sure that this is the first of the big Banks you know so and that the creative capacity of the universe extends not just to you know the the microorganisms the organisms on this planet but entire galaxies and and stars and the collapsing of stars and the emerging of planets and the evolution of life on the planets and just countless galaxies countless galaxies so we now are the first generation to truly appreciate the scale of the universe that we're involved in both of its age and its expanse and we've all been fascinated by the wonderful images coming from the Hubble telescope and other pre other Scopes that are giving us these magnificent pictures of the scale of existence and it's in that context I think that we have to look at our own existence our own species existence and ask what are we doing what's Happening Here If there is intelligence how is this intelligence expressing itself here in our life and in particular why is it so hard why is life so hard why couldn't life be made easier it's like so I can believe in God but I don't believe in I don't accept the universe that this God has created and and I agree with those deep sentiments because they honor our children they honor life and there is no justification on the surface like that for their suffering and their pain foreign but again if we look at this in a context a human being is a growing intelligence a human being is growing and its growth rests upon the shoulders of the primate Kingdom which rests upon the shoulders of of other life forms which preceded the primates and so on down the evolutionary ladder if we want to assess the condition and judge the conditions certainly we have to ask ourselves the question foreign are we at the end of this process are we are we all that there is is this where it's going to end is this is this what's happening if you go to see a play and it's a 10 act play and you're only in the first scene of the First Act clearly you don't have enough information to know whether the play is a good play you must see it through to the end if you're on a car assembly plant and you're only at station three and they're 215 Stations of the simply plant and you're seeing something being built but you don't even see enough to understand where it's going or what it is then you just can't understand the process and part of the advantages or one of the great advantages of working with psychedelic States is that it allows you under certain conditions to expand Beyond this moment of time be it allows you to expand and to dissolve not only into the intelligence that's manifesting as the universe that's manifesting as the life forms in the universe but it also allows you to experience not only the distant past of this self-manifesting universe but also the future of this self-manifesting universe entering into what I call Deep time and my experiences in deep time have convinced me that there are dimensions in which the universe knows itself which go far beyond this present moment and in those Encounters in those dissolving into the deep future I've been able to experience or have been given the experiences of something of the creative process something of the how creativity is expressing itself in human beings and we come here to make choices we make choices and we learned we make bad choices we have bad consequences we make good choices we have better consequences but we're just getting started we only became self-aware about 5 000 years ago I mean we only became aware of the Consciousness that lies at the center of our being our common our deep Consciousness we only began to have access to that about 5 000 years ago self-awareness came earlier but what the self is began about 5 000 years ago and we are just getting started we are just beginning to exercise the full potential which lies latent within the human being and in that process in that creative process we are dealing with a very incomplete creation a very incomplete planet an incomplete species and a species which in some ways is still living out of very barbaric primitive levels of self-understanding and in its primitiveness inflicts great damage on the beings around it it's like the pain of being an individual Leaf is so terrible we go insane and we inflict damage on other leaves but it's not just that it's like the process of evolution itself is incomplete is still working it out working things out the process of organic evolution is incomplete SRI arbindo said humanity is a transitional species we are not the end of the line we are simply a transition going from a lower order of awareness into a higher order of awareness when then when we stabilize at a higher level of awareness we're going into yet unhire and a higher level of awareness the ability of mine to be able to influence matter the ability of mind to be able to manifest Joy Grace fruition inside matter is still being developed the ability of our mind to be able to control the diseases of the body they're still being developed we are basically so profoundly incomplete nature is so profoundly incomplete my basic response to suffering is that it does reflect in certain ways the incompleteness of the universe it also reflects the terrifying demands of learning through experience of experiencing the consequences in some instances not at all but in some instances of learn of inheriting the consequences of choices that we've made so that we can learn from those choices and make better choices in the future but not all suffering really derives from Human choices at all some suffering just divides from what we would call the cruelties of nature this planet is a severe Place hurricanes come through and wipe out thousands of lives earthquakes wipe out thousands of lives biology takes out thousands of children foreign this is a very very intense world we must be willing to look suffering in the face if we want to understand the deeper the deeper intentionality that is expressing itself In This Very incomplete place and time we tend to sort of see God as all perfect and static and unchanging and therefore we hold God responsible for making this that and the other but I don't think that's the way it is at all we are cells in the being of God we are cells in the being of the Divine the Divine is not separate from any of the pain that the children are experiencing the Divine is not other than or distant from what's going on what's taking place but we are cells within the emerging the Divine we are aspects of its so the pain is always felt always registered always held we are all in this together and we are growing together now here's the thing if we were to stop the whole process right now if we were to hold the creative intent the designer accountable for just where we are right now that we would have to conclude it's a bastard he's a bastard because it's just too much pain there's too much pain but if we were able to go forward in time if we could go even such a short distance of time of a hundred thousand years from now and experience an evolved Humanity what we are becoming what we are in the process of becoming we would experience a much Kinder Humanity a much more gracious Humanity a much more intelligent Humanity a much more compassionate Humanity a Humanity that was much better able to manage still the fluctuations of nature which are so painful and so catastrophic and we just it's hard to Envision where this is going where this is taking us now this brings me to the the deeper part of your question where are we now in this process where what is what's happening in our historical circumstances what is the future immediate future for our species and here I know that I'm sharing just my own Visionary experiences I know that what may be powerful and true for one person would not necessarily be powerful or true for another person so I can only share with you what my experience has been early on in my sessions all starting around the 23rd session so for the last 50 of my sessions one of the recurring themes of my sessions was that where humanity is going where we're what's happening and the vision was over and over repeated we are coming into a turning point in history we're coming into a decisive before and after Point uh that we were poised on the edge of a magnificent transition into a higher level of functioning that there was that there was a greatness in emerging within humanity and when I look around at history I thought I'd say well I don't exactly see that I see people being just as stupid now as they were you know 5 000 years ago in so many ways and just as cruel but my sessions kept saying no no look deeper there is an emerging greatness in humanity and again I understand this within reincarnation there is to see humanity is not just to see the present generation but it's to see the living pulsing of life incarnating again and again over many thousands of years and the greatness that is emerging is the greatness that's emerging at that deeper level of accumulation of the Soul which is collecting and harvesting all the learning all the suffering all the experimentation all the courage all the Innovation that's been we're cultivating through all of these lifetimes so the my sessions kept showing me that there is a greatness emerging in the human story and that there was a we were coming into a decisive turning point in history but it never showed me how it was going to realize this I had no idea how this was going to come about and then in the 55th session it took me into what I call the Great Awakening session it took me deep into the future and it took me there in order to allow me to experience the death and rebirth of the human species and I don't mean that as a physical death and rebirth but a sort of psychospiritual death and rebirth but a death and rebirth that did involve much physical suffering in many deaths and I had this experience not as Chris beige or not as even crispation of an expanded version of myself but I had the experience as the entire species my Consciousness had dissolved into the collective psyche so that experienced a profound Crescendo of suffering and a birth coming out of this suffering that was a birth of a new human being a new form of human being basically I experienced a historical period of an unraveling loss of control an inability to control the circumstances of our life a tremendous kind of confronting of the sins of the fathers we are our own fathers of course who are confronting of our past a confronting of all the foibles and the limitations and the divisiveness of history and the short-sightedness of our forms of governance that we had emerged and it it was a Global Systems crisis it seemed to be driven by a global ecological crisis but a Global Systems crisis where Humanity was basically forced ultimately into simply trying to survive and for a time it looked like we weren't going to survive it looked like it was an Extinction event it looked like we were going to lose our place in existence altogether but just when the storm was at its peak just when things were at their worst it was as if a hurricane passed over the island and the skies began to clear and when the skies began to clear there were many survivors there had been many deaths but there were many survivors and when the survivors began to pick themselves up and began to move forward and find each other they're sprang forth from within each of them individually and from within the collective new ways of knowing new ways of feeling new understandings new insights fundamentally at its core there was the birth of an appreciation of Oneness an experience of Oneness not as a theory not as kind of an ideology but an experience of that tree that underlies individual Leaf Consciousness that we truly are one we truly are connected to each other and in that birth of that awareness we began to build a new world not the World created by the ego and the ego is a magnificent expression of creativity the ego is magnificent but the ego is divided from the fundamental Springs of of Consciousness and from each other and the world with your ego has created is a divided world it's a it's a world which favors some portions of society it thinks the expense of others it's not a world that works for all foreign with the birth of Oneness with the birth of this transformation we began to build a new world we began to build a world which truly truly did work for all in which there was it was truly a new beginning and this creativity these new ideas they fed upon themselves so there was a cascading of of more and more Beauty more and more knowledge more and more understanding and I think what was taking place what I experienced was a collective birth of the diamond soul that the soul was waking up on Earth that we were waking up and understanding ourselves to be not simply hundred-year-old beings we were waking up and experiencing ourselves to be hundred thousand year old beings with relationships a hundred thousand years old and in that awareness we not only experienced a much deeper compassion with other human beings and other life forms altogether but we experienced greater transparency to the creative intelligence of the universe itself we were no longer experientially isolated from the cosmic intelligence of the universe but we could take in deeper downloads from the intelligence of the universe and with these deeper downloads there was no technological problem which we could not solve because we were awake intellectually at deeper levels we could understand things understandings came easier there was no technological barriers to what we could accomplish in this world this is the birth what I call the birth of the future human and I think the future human is the diamond soul incarnating in history in my one of the last great vision of my journey in the 70th session when I thought I was beyond all the meltdowns that I'd gone through before I'd gone through so many meltdowns it put me through the worst stripped down of my entire 20-year Journey it just broke me down terribly and I think it was necessary in order to give me the experiences that followed and it took me deeper into the future than it had ever taken me before and in this condition one of the experiences that unfolded there is that it gave me yet again and my deepest experience of the future human it was as if I was allowed to try on for size the new archetype of the new human that had emerged had been birthed in the in evolution and just touching this being was so extraordinary just if I try to describe it I don't think I can do it without crying just a magnificent Beauty just a completely healed Humanity healed of all the scars that had accumulated through all those thousands of years of incarnating a heart an ex explosively large heart a magnificent a magnificent mind under capable of Illumination that staggers the imagination this is the child which we're trying to give birth to this is a child which I think we are beginning to give birth to in this century I think we are entering the dark night of our Collective Soul and just as in mystical Traditions before in order for full spiritual realization to emerge there must take place a dark night of our soul which is a time of purification a time of confronting the poisons that are left over from our past behaviors and opening and as this Dark Night comes to fruition there is a a death a death to that old self and a birth of something new and when that new opens it basically all the mystics and all the great Saints tell us the same thing it makes all the purification worthwhile it makes all the hardships worthwhile that's when a mother gives birth when she holds her child then the Pains of Labor are forgotten it they're worthwhile I think something like that is happening for Humanity we are in the process we have been gestating the new Humanity for thousands and hundreds of thousands of years reincarnation Lifetime by LifeTime we've been gestating the new Humanity gestation takes a long time birth is a short time birth is a very intense process and I think we are in a collective Dark Night of the of the Soul now we may just be in the early stages of it I think we are maybe in what John of the Cross called The Dark Knight of the self which is the early stage of purification and transformation but these will be followed by deeper purification deeper transformation until eventually will let go of our past until eventually when it hurts so much to stay as we were will begin to open up into who we can be and who we need to be in order to save life on this planet in that process I think we're giving birth to the new Humanity and when we give birth to the new Humanity we will look back over the whole of human evolution and all the suffering that has been involved and we will say not that it wasn't real not that it wasn't terrible but that in a larger order of things it was worth it because now we are operating at a completely different blueprint of the human psyche so I think we're in hard times we're in for Hard Times ahead but I think these are magnificently important times extremely creative times and times which will demand a great deal from us individually and collectively but if we engage them conscientiously if we engage them heart and soul I think they're going to change our life individually and the life of our children and our grandchildren our great-grandchildren forever so that's that's the visions that were poured into me and so that's I just share them with you wow that's uh it really leaves me speechless it's hard it's hard now I want to say to that that's beautiful absolutely beautiful uh I can see how I can see how that removes any anxiety really about death and about life and about the future of us um as individuals of species it's just a beautiful beautiful vision so every time we die you know of course at a deepest level all the spiritual Traditions tell us no one dies we just transition into a different level of reality and I'm not making light of death and I'm not trivializing at all but just affirming this deeper Insight that everything we are survives the death of this body and at the end of every lifetime we return to where we came from as a resting place and we are restored and refreshed and then we return to the challenges of History you know so it's it's we don't have to go through all the evolutionary future in order to know freedom from fear of death in fact one of the if they were one thing for my psychedelic experiences that I wish I could I could give to the world it would be eliminating the fear of death and I not only am not afraid of dying I'm looking forward to it because death is homecoming always death is homecoming I know different spiritual Traditions have said that in different ways but I find Carl Jung's he says at one point that life is a short period between two Infinities which in the end might just be one so I think that's a beautiful way of putting it yeah um beautifully said yeah there is one more thing that he says that I want to ask how you see this in light of your experiences para young used to say I can I can either be good or I can be whole so he had a tremendous respect for the dark side of the psyche for evil so how do you see that do you see evil falling away as our Eagles fall away when we become this future human or do you see some deeper logic people continuing and becoming integrated and then serving some higher purpose foreign by differentiating between darkness and Evil people often fuse those but I think they're they're different uh Darkness evil is a kind of a twisting of life it is a a process in which life in some way has turned in upon itself and has cut itself so deeply off from its source that it has become Twisted cancerous and needs to be restored needs to be healed Darkness on the other hand is simply part of the inertia of existence it's part it's kind of like what what the big bang explodes into it's what it's what is the resistance to the creative process itself but I think when when young talked about I'd rather be hold and be good he was claiming all the parts of his life which weren't necessarily socially good or even that he would deem good he was claiming the whole of his life and I think that's what happens in spiritual practice and it certainly happens in psychedelic practice we grab the whole of our life we grab all aspects of it even the parts that that we're embarrassed by and the parts we're ashamed of are the parts that we feel are unforgivable we embrace them all and as we embrace them all all those twisted or unintegrated or injured aspects of ourself are brought back into healing and are brought back into wholeness so that there emerges out of that wholeness a higher order of goodness a different order of goodness but it is it it is that commitment to embracing the shadow to let no corner of our being be excluded from Redemption we might say nothing can be left out otherwise the the system is incomplete it's like there's a chorus but some of the voices are gone we have to have all of them present for the course to be complete so that in evolution in our social evolution in our spiritual Evolution clearly there is much darkness in the world there is much twisted so we could say there is much evil but I don't think of evil as a cosmological process I've never experienced it that way I've never experienced evil in that way I experience Darkness I've experienced confusion I've experienced pain and suffering but not evil as such and I think that's what SRI arabindo I mean Rama Krishna met when he said if you want to understand God you must look suffering in the face and suffering doesn't come from a second principle it doesn't come from an evil demiurge it comes from the Divine suffering is part of the Divine expression we have to understand how life works and we must look deep if we're going to see the compassion and existence we must be able to look very very deep because there is so much suffering but and I think the suffering is in the process of being redeemed in history in the sense that it is part of a self-learning process which is taking us somewhere and it's taking us somewhere exciting and somewhere magnificent so I guess I would say that darkness is being redeemed in evolution uh I don't think I don't know what will happen as we make this transition into this higher form of humanity I'm sure that even if we did make this transition within a thousand years say or even sooner into a higher manifestation of Human Experience on the planet it doesn't end there you know it's we're going to keep going for millions of more years billions of more years uh so I'm sure there will be challenges that we'll face there'll be thresholds that we'll face but along the way I think we're we just have to let go of some of the early stories that we've been telling ourselves that somehow evil has its hand on the earth or somehow that there is a malevolent force that intends us to suffer this way or that we can escape this suffering by simply being good experiencing salvation and and going to heaven when we die and leaving the Earth behind and just not being here anymore we just have to let go of a lot of our old stories and open up into a deeper understanding of the cosmological process of creation self-manifestation of the creative intelligence Chris um I realize that I'm taking quite a lot of your time so um before we finish I want to ask you now that you've written your book because uh correct me if I'm wrong button you uh discontinued you finished your LSD sessions and then it took 20 years was it and then you published your your book 20 years later so so how has the writing of your book and then doing of you know speaking about your experiences how has that changed your insights and what is left for you to do in this lifetime what uh yes learn to cook well maybe let me back up a little bit and describe what happened when I stopped my work uh because that'll lead into the writing of the book um I stopped my work in 99 and I stopped it for a number of reasons but foremost among them I stopped it because the the domain of diamond Luminosity that I entered and in those last five years and 26 sessions I entered this reality only four times and in between those four entrances into the diamond Luminosity they were very very intense purifications and healings and catharsis that were taking place but I entered that Joy of dissolving into the light and it made coming back I reached a point where it was just too painful to come back into time space and there was a sadness in coming back and I knew I had to uh I couldn't take being separated from the universe that deep intimacy again I couldn't take entering into the joy and then coming back out of the joy anymore that I had to let go uh there were other things going on I was also running enormous energy in my body that I realized I was really kind of at a subtle energy level I was running too hot I needed to stop and let my system calm down and let my subtle Energy System recalibrate but the primary reason I stopped is because of a heartache I couldn't I couldn't take coming back anymore so I stopped and I had been given so many blessings through the years and had been shown so many things that I thought I could just stop and I would continue to be nourished by the treasures that I had been given by the diamonds that I had been given and it that's true and that did happen but that turned out to be only half of what happened I found over the years that followed a deep sadness emerging in my life and I I began to realize that underneath all the things I was doing publishing and writing and taking care of my children and teaching that there was a a sadness a longing that I was suffering from a loss of communion with the Divine I was suffering from a loneliness with the divine and I basically was just waiting to die I was living my life taking care of everybody but in my heart I was just waiting to die so I could return to my beloved and years went on and it didn't get better and I began to realize that this is not this is not good it's not good living your life waiting to die it's good to be completely Fearless of death but it's not good to be waiting to die that somewhere along the way I must have made a mistake I must have done something wrong somewhere my life was screaming failure to integrate but because I had taken so much care to integrate each individual session it wasn't clear where my failure lie lay so I turned to find where I had made a mistake and in time I came to understand that there was an imbalance in my life it was like I had plunged myself so deep into the Transcendent divine that I had lost my foothold in the Manifest Divine I had gone so deep into the Transcendent dimension that I had lost hold of the other truth I mean I knew it intellectually but I wasn't able to live it fully and that is the truth at the physical universe and my being as part of the physical universe is the Divine the physical world is the body of the Divine so when I began to see that the problem was this imbalance between Transcendence and imminence I made a decisive move to embrace the my physical existence more completely to really by a force of will and by a cultivation of practices to live my life as I was in his incompleteness for the remaining days on this Earth and to recommit myself to being here inside time and space on this planet and as part of this process and it took me about 10 years to get fully comfortable being inside time and space again and which is maybe one more reason why no one should do the kind of work that I did you know I hope that people don't have to go through what I went through I think maybe it's better to work in smaller Doses and more incremental stages and make maybe smaller progress but also hold on to more of the progress that you do make in opening up to Transcendence but along the way I also learned that there was a second reason for my kind of estrangement or unhappiness and the second reason was what I call the sickness of Silence I'm a teacher I love to learn and I love to share what I've learned but because of the laws surrounding psychedelics and because of the our psychedelic phobic culture I wasn't allowed to talk about what I experienced I wasn't allowed to bring my psychedelic knowledge into the classroom I wasn't allowed to share it with my colleagues so the silence which had allowed me to do this work at this time in history was also not allowing me to fully integrate it into my personal life into my public life I integrated them privately psychologically as best I could but I couldn't integrate them into my historical presence I couldn't be in the real world in the physical world who I knew myself to be in the shamanic world and in this respect writing diamonds from Heaven has been a deep healing process to finally now that I've I've retired and I retired a little early in order to write this book but to finally be in a position where I'm able to say what I did to say what happened to me in these sessions and to share the experience of the universe and not that I think my experiences in any way unique or special because it's just I'm one person among a whole psychedelic Community that's having all of these types of experiences but to finally be able to be completely honest and candid that this is what I've been doing all these years this is who I am in my inner life behind my public Persona of my academic life that has been very healing and it's also done some interesting things as I've was working on the book and the years working on the book and as I've begun to talk about it my psychedelic memories have begun to congeal and to live in me differently than they lived in me before I was talking so just to be able to talk about these things with you and and with other people has allowed me to be more whole Within Myself it's like the Psychedelic half of my life and the physical half of my life are coming together and something is happening uh something there is a deepening of integration and a deepening of transparency to spiritual reality and I don't know where it's going to go I truly don't I think in three years from now I could be in a very different place than I am now and I'm in a different place now than I was before I wrote the book so I think you know the pin van lomal is a near-death episode researcher and he wrote a wonderful book on near-death episodes and he says at the end of the book that his experience with people have near-death experiences is that integration can't really take place until they can talk about their experiences and share them and I think that's true with psychedelic experiences too that at some levels we can't fully integrate our experiences until we can share them and I think writing diamonds from Heaven has been part of sharing my history hopefully that'll be useful to other people and it'll support them in their work and and as we go into this intense historical period so what there's been a a birth of a new joy in a way a birth of just being able to be Who I Really Am which is a flawed human being who's had some pretty unusual experiences and uh loves to be in conversation with other human beings who have also had unusual experiences so that we can together see what our experiences have taught us about the universe that we're in okay yeah well Chris your uh experiences and your words are truly diamonds from heaven and I'm sincerely grateful and I want to express your gratitude for for a while for your courage to undertake these experiences and to share them and to speak about them not just to me but to so many people and I know I can speak for myself and I know for others that you're at work really touches people's uh people's hearts and people's lives and I think it's very important work so I really thank you on the behalf of not only myself but the greater Collective um so I thank you very much um again I I really don't want to take too much of your day but is there anything that we didn't touch that you'd like to talk about hmm maybe just one piece because I think there's a lesson for me in this and maybe a lesson for others I had an experience in the 50th session which was the second Diamond Luminosity session the second time I was taken deep into Diamond luminosity and so this was the deepest I ever got in any of my sessions into the deep structure of the universe and I was in a place of extraordinary Bliss and joy and I had dissolved completely into the boundaryless condition of just pure light just hyper hyper clear clear light that's so clear and Justin when I was at this peak of 50 sessions and and all these years of experience all of a sudden my entire visual field rotated 90 degrees and a space opened up and I saw reality far far in the distance filled with an even higher form of polite and a beam of light came out of that reality and hit me and it absolutely shattered me and I realized at that point that the journey into the Divine or the journey into the universe was infinite there's no end to it because like many people I had thought that you did this work you took the journey in order to get to the end in order to get home in order to get to back to Source become one with God or to dissolve into the Primal void but I had become one with the Divine and I had learned that there are many levels of Oneness and I had dissolved into the void but I learned that there are many levels of of the Void to dissolve into but this experience showed me that even using this extraordinarily powerful method I would never ever be able to explore the universe in its totality it's just so big so vast with so many layers to it such wonderful expanse and this was this represented a fundamental pivot first it just shook me to the core to realize the true expanse of what I was involved in and then it relaxed me into uh into a just a deep sense of existential relaxation and this is why if I were doing this work over again I would be gentler with myself because I've learned that the goal is not to try to get to some destination not to get to some place because no matter how hard I pushed new doors kept opening and new doors kept opening now I understand that a better way to think about this work is that we open ourselves and we make ourselves porous to the totality of life and we let in as much of this knowledge and as much of the energy and as much of the compassion as it's possible we let it in and we try to hold it and bring it into our being and enter and become more porous to it and open to it so it's it's not a process of kind of going out and exploring it's really a process of intaking bringing it in and and bringing it into the very roots of our being let it change not only our mind and our convictions but letting it change our biology literally it reaches into and changes I think as a very subtle physiological levels that we're maybe just beginning to appreciate and and haven't begun to map yet and once you understand that it's not about trying to get to the end of this road but it's really about becoming more conscious and more skillful as we stand between two realities one reality in time space and the realer reality outside of time and space the nerd in the mother universe and the daughter Universe we are in the daughter universe we are always surrounded and Infused by the mother universe and if we can stand a stride Both Worlds and integrate the constant inflow of the life from the mother Universe in increasing measure inside the daughter universe then that kind of that brings a an instantiated Joy an incarnate Joy a a sense of richer and richer presence inside time and space sweet allow time and space to become increasingly transparent to that which created time and space so I would encourage a gentler a gentler psychedelic process a gentle in entry into the great expanse and I would be I'm more patient now with how long spiritual unfold thing takes than maybe I was when I was a young man [Music]</p>

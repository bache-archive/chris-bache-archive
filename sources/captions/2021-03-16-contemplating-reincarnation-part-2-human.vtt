00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.880
Well, hello, Richard.
It's good to continue our discussion.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.780
You know, in our previous discussion,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.020
we sort of started
the discussion of reincarnation.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.100
We looked at the evidence

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.060
for reincarnation, these extraordinary
children from around the world.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.780
We began to unpack that evidence into a
deeper understanding of the rhythms

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.698
of life and the stages of human evolution
that reincarnation makes possible.

00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:43.860
The restoration

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.380
of the theme of the meaningfulness
of the challenges that we find embedded

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.980
in our life,
and the opportunity to actually

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.780
deepen our therapeutic interventions
in the places where we are stuck,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.040
the places where we're holding pain,
that are rooted in our deeper history.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.900
So now, today, we take it farther.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.460
We begin to look deeper
into the significance of what are we?

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.880
What's the significance of the fact
that we are reincarnating beings,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.040
in the universe that obviously
supports and nurtures,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.480
and created this reincarnation dynamic?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.850
That's a huge difference.
Isn't it?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.960
Like,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.290
to be living in a universe that is

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.820
nurturing us, you know, that has a kind
of paternal/maternal energy, you know,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.980
surrounding it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.280
That has

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.520
such a different framework

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.380
to be born into?

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.290
Yeah.
And, you know,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.760
I want to mention at the outset,
that sometimes reincarnation thinkers

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.980
go in a direction of thinking that - every
little bitty thing in our life has

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.900
a determined quality,
a deterministic quality.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.820
But I don't think we necessarily need

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.380
to go there, because chance is one of the
powerful elements of this universe.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.340
And so we can affirm meaning,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.060
and we can affirm intentionality
without putting every detail of our life

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.220
into that press,
and ask, 'Well, what's the meaning of this

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.380
and what's the meaning of that?'
to affirm a larger scope of meaning.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.380
Still, in a world where there are chance,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.020
and there are variables
and there are uncertainties.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.700
What's important, I think,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.640
is understanding that the universe
pays attention to how we respond

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.700
to chance events, as well as intentional
events, that our learning and the quality

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.300
of our response is carried forward
and does us credit,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.220
regardless of the origin
of the challenges that we're facing.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.600
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.920
I just, funnily enough, today,
recorded a short meditation.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.360
And in it I asked people to kind
of imagine the universe, with its--

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.960
with-- criss-crossed
by its fields of Karma,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.680
you know, almost these ley
lines through time and space,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.980
that kind of have this karmic energy,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.480
they're rippling. And the whole of the
cosmos is rippling with these fields.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.860
And then I asked each

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.580
person-- well I asked
whoever's meditating,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.397
to send out one really beautiful thought.

00:03:25.597 --> 00:03:30.020
Like, just from the depth of their soul,
send out a really beautiful

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:37.140
thought into that, and see the universe
respond to that and see how it enters

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.300
the field. And how the universe
maybe kind of sighs and expands.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.440
And how it reaches every single tiny area,
almost like it opens up synapses

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.140
in some way. And just the power of--

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.460
the incalculable power
of something like that, you know,

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.640
dropped into the ocean of time space.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.180
You know, I found that,
like, a really powerful

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.300
contemplation to do.
Yeah.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.300
Absolutely, I agree.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.640
That's been very much my experience
and my own work with psychedelics.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.420
There was nothing that I did,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.900
working at deep levels,
that was mine alone, that was private.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.140
And that the pain came from a larger

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.180
collective web, and the healing spread
out into a larger collective web.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.240
And

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.580
that really those exercises,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.500
the meditations that you're describing,
I think really are important for changing

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.560
the thought of a tilt in how we
live in the universe, because

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.620
according to just our physical senses we

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.580
have this feeling often
that life happens to us.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.380
Life is something independent

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.300
of us and then it just happens to us, and
then we're victims of it and we respond.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.740
But when you begin to
send out energy into the universe,

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.100
when you begin to send out healing
and love into the universe,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.260
and you watch the universe respond
in immediate and then indirect ways,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.460
then you begin to shift into a-- the sense
that you are living in a dynamic field.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.540
You are part of a dynamic field,
living in a field.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.980
And at the very deep level,

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.020
on the subtle level,
you are creating your universe as you go.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.400
Once you begin to understand that,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.300
still, it doesn't mean you're free of all

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.580
the karma that's coming
at you from the past.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.300
It's still working its
way through the system.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.260
But, increasingly,
the balance of your life tilts

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.700
from being kind of the passive recipient
of things that you personally didn't

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.060
start, to being the generator
of the life that you are inheriting now.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.280
Yeah.
You're no longer a victim.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.440
You're a creator, yeah? Participator.
Creator, yes.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.400
We got this great question

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.280
that thought that we'd

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.840
kind of inject into this talk, which is
- what happens to us when we die?

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.920
So shall we-- let's explore
that, I mean you know that

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.820
other-- many other cultures--
I think we wanted to mention the Tibetans

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.669
because they seem to really have a handle
on some of these things.

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:14.620
Egyptians as well, but,
you know, Tibetans, perhaps

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.480
are a little bit more contemporary
because they're still here.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.560
They're still practising very much

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.380
those teachings, the Bardo teachings.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.260
And psychotherapists are now
exploring this territory.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.500
Joel Whitton's first book 'Life
Between Life'

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.220
explored this. And Michael Newton's work,
and his books 'Journey of Souls'

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.740
and 'Destiny of Souls' are very
systematic attempts to explore

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.220
through deep states of regression,
of spiritual regression,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.300
what happens to people when they
go through the death process.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.060
So, really, we've got two halves of life.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.380
We've got birth to death,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.340
and then we've got birth-- death to birth.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.540
And we've been missing this side.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.180
But really you have to understand

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.260
the whole circle
to really understand what happens.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.660
So, yeah, let's jump into it.
Yeah.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.920
So obviously

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.160
you know the Tibetans
have coined this phrase 'The Bardo',

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.220
which is this in between state.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.820
But it can also be used to describe

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.300
a transformational
experience, you know because

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.780
that's-- life is filled
with transformational experiences.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.820
But particularly when you're moving

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.140
through a threshold, across a threshold,
you know, like death or birth are classic

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.180
thresholds,
and they sit there as kind of almost

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.700
an allegory of all transformation,
don't they?

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.280
Death and birth.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.500
Because we have so many deaths and births,
even within one lifetime.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.560
So

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.380
it seems like

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:53.552
a kind of obvious logic to expand that
allegory out beyond individual births,

00:07:53.752 --> 00:07:57.620
and see it everywhere
throughout the entire Cosmos.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.780
And I know you've experienced this very
profoundly in your psychedelic journeys.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.381
Like this constant-- you've described,

00:08:05.581 --> 00:08:06.740
like, those constant

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.840
states of transformation that-- or
you've been through them.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.480
In those-- do you know what I'm

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.060
pointing to, this constant rebirth?

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.120
Yeah.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.940
Yes, I mean when I started the work,
I thought there was just one death--

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.180
ego death, that would then launch
you into the spiritual universe.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.780
But what I found is, of course,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.100
the spiritual universe has many,
many layers to it.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.820
And just because you're operational

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.300
at certain layers doesn't mean you're
operational yet at deeper layers.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.420
And you actually have to go through
another metamorphosis of death

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.100
and surrender to be reborn into that
'nother layer, and so on, and so forth.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.060
And that reflects
the Tibetan idea of Bardo.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.540
Bardo really means a discrete
layer of consciousness.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.700
And so when they're describing

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.780
the after-death journey, there are
multiple Bardos that manifest themselves.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.180
Now we in the West have tended to use

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.700
the term Bardo to expand on that,
and basically let the Bardo represent

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.340
the sum total of all things that happen
to us when we die, on the other side.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.540
And that's a perfectly acceptable,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.100
you know, use of the term.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.180
But their use of it is in terms
of stages of that progression.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.580
So there's one Bardo,
you pass through another Bardo,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.300
you pass through--
there's the Bardo of the Hungry Ghost,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.460
to the Bardo of the Heavenly Spirits,
and things like this.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.720
But the basic pattern I
think that they identified,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.660
is the same pattern that the
psychotherapists are identifying too.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:38.080
That when we die,
we go through a period of reunion

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.363
with our soul,

00:09:39.563 --> 00:09:42.020
with our-- and our soul lineage.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.260
And the first thing that takes place

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.860
is that we debrief
from our most recent life.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.160
We basically

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.480
process

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.520
the life that we just lived, in
the context of absolute love

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.780
and a love so deep it's not
even a matter of forgiveness.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.620
But we experience
the totality of our life,

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:09.740
all of our shortcomings, all of our good
deeds, in the context of infinite love.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.260
And we have the opportunity

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:16.700
to look at our life and see what we did
well and see what we didn't do well.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.540
And we have the whole notion, don't we,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.800
of like, the 'life flashing before you
as you die', like, this kind of replay

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.280
in the timeless dimension.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.520
You know, because there's-- so

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.510
it makes perfect sense,

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.860
like, for us to go through that
deep reflection at the end of something.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.780
And it's what we do in life, right?

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.840
Yeah.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.376
I think that with the near-death
experience of a life-review,

00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:49.400
is a snapshot of what happens,
kind of, in a full death experience of

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.620
a-- just a detailed reliving
of every detail, every nuance.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.420
Far more details than we can keep
track of inside time and space.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.580
And we see how our life rippled
out and touched other people.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:09.140
We experience how our evil deeds hurt
and how our good deeds helped.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:14.180
And so we experience the totality
of our life in the seamless fabric.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.900
And we experience them
without a physical body.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.282
So we experience them in a subtle
body which is much more intense.

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:23.260
You know like the Astral Body,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:28.480
or as it's so called, or the Mental Body,
these subtle layers, the Causal Body,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.660
you know. Without the physicality,

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:38.200
the intensity of those emotions that we
probably feel, or we review,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.333
have given rise to this notion of,

00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:45.760
like, eternal damnation from,
you know, the Christians, for example.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.460
Or even, like, the eternal bliss
realms of the Buddhas-- the Buddhists.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.120
Or heaven and hell and, you know--

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.900
because there's this sense of eternity.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.560
I think it's a correct intuition,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.120
because

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.980
when there's no-- when you're out of time

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.360
and space, in that sense,
you're in that place of grace,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.240
then an experience

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.460
of, you know, the harm you've caused or

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.260
the hurt you've caused
could feel like it--

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.740
you know, in that moment, in that timeless
space, could feel like it's infinite.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.860
You know, 'I've caused, like, an intense
pain,' and then seeing the ripple

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:29.300
of that pain into a life, and
how it carries on through that being,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.300
and then finally gets worked out.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.580
I mean I don't know how-- what level we
experience that,

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:39.380
but I imagine we experience
a lot of the subtler dimensions

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.120
of our karmic,
you know, the repercussions of our karma.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.360
They're pretty-- very intense!

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.060
Yeah. But then what locks in this
experience,

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.860
this phenomenology of eternity,
what locks it in as a metaphysical

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.180
principle is the mistaken view
that we only live once.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.580
So we've had our chance, and there's
absolutely no chance to correct it.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:09.020
So if you're going to be accountable,
and if you're going to,

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.740
you know, be accountable to good,

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.140
and you've screwed up, then you're
punished forever, and ever, and ever.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.980
And of course, fortunately,

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.180
no one finds that when they actually
get into the deep-- the depth of it.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.060
The past-life therapists don't find

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.200
that, the Buddhists don't
find that. That we do--

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.098
we are accountable, we are responsible,

00:13:29.298 --> 00:13:33.980
we do experience the pain we cause
others, but that's so that we can learn,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.780
and that's so that we can come back and do

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.500
better next time,
and better next time, and grow, and grow.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:46.540
Yeah, I mean, I'm from a lineage of
distillers in my family.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.880
And so

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.160
I like the-- you know, I look at it-- this
is my intuitive

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.780
reading of perhaps
you know a colourful way of maybe

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.680
how this happens, is that
there's a distilling process,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.700
and in that-- or
a fermentation of some form.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.660
So that the grosser matter starts
to fall down back to Earth in a way.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.540
Like this is the notion of having these

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.020
subtle bodies, where the lower
bodies, the Astral, you know,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.520
those lower

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.300
energies that we've created,

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:22.580
fall back into the lower plains, and then
something higher gets crystallised.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.580
The distillation of our life.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.180
All that was good about it, all that we've

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.700
learned is being distilled
into this purer,

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.420
kind of quintessence, that then stays

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:38.600
and adds to our soul's trajectory.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.880
But then the lower--

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.580
all that kind of elemental energy

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.840
that sinks back into those
lower planes of being,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.560
they also carry our Karma,

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.460
those droplets, if you like, of karma,

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.220
sink back down and they-- you know, we
still have to redress them.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.060
Although they-- my understanding is

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.820
that they move into the
collective field as well.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.800
So, every act

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.500
or every word we speak, let's say,

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.100
or every thought we have,
goes into the collective.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.200
So

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.020
that, you know, we are all co-creating

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.820
the karma of humanity,
the collective karma of humanity.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.560
And then we have to return

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.300
to pick up where we left-off.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.000
But we have this

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.854
enhanced soul,

00:15:28.054 --> 00:15:32.580
you know, this-- that
we've learned from.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.000
So when we return,
there's more awareness present.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.640
So there is this continuity,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.660
you know, and the other way I see it is

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.180
that there's-- you know, our
lives are trajectories.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.500
They're like arcs.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.620
I say there's an arc.
It's like an arc.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.340
It's curving.
It's always moving.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.340
If you looked at it, it might be a spiral,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.100
or it might have one of these
Kundalini shapes underneath it.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.400
It's not a straight line.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.600
And that is what we--

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.980
that's what never ends, that arc.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.100
We follow that arc and it goes
through the portal and it continues.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.440
And that's the lineage.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.660
If you're able to trace that arc
in your inner being,

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.860
then you can trace your lineage, where
you've come from and where you're going.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:25.420
And your memory can travel down that arc,
your awareness can travel down that arc,

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:31.420
which enables you to remember, or
to predict, in the case of Tibetans,

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.640
to predict where you'll return,

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.300
because the awareness is aware of
the arc, not just in its own life.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:45.340
Because if you look at an arc,
within one life, it may do that.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:50.000
But then if you can see it-- if you
can project it beyond this life,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.820
you can then-- you know your
awareness can predict

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.600
intuitively where you're coming back,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.540
can even maybe even further than predict?

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.440
Maybe it can even create,

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.460
you know, where you are going
to return, in some respect.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.520
So anyway that's-- those are ideas, yeah.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.740
You know I've never been very interested
in tracing my genealogy,

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.180
but I have been interested
in tracing the genealogy of my soul,

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.180
which is what you're describing. Just

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.900
reaching back and basically what you
might think of as deep remembering.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.140
Remembering who you are,
who you have been.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.420
And when you do that,

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:33.920
you do have a certain sense of trajectory,
of kind of developmental process.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.050
And your pointing to the collective,
I think, is absolutely right.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.160
What we're learning is the individual
and the collective are evolving together.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.500
They are functionally separate systems,
but they are deeply intertwined.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.680
So everything we are
doing as an individual

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.140
seeds the growth of the collective,

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.460
and everything the collective is doing
seeds the growth of the individual.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.810
So that when I leave,
I really do believe that when I leave

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.620
space-time, when I die, and even if I were
to leave the entire system altogether,

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:11.920
all of my experiences, all of your
experiences will be held in perfect--

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.010
I won't say duplication,
because we are human beings and everything

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.770
we experience,
the human species gets to hold onto,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:25.700
and therefore our life experience
becomes part of its life experience.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.770
Our love and understanding becomes
part of its love and understanding.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.290
And it is part of its generative matrix,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.140
out of which it gives birth to the next
generation of human beings.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.220
So it's a 'both hands' situation here.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.640
It's beautiful,
the notion of the Akashic field,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.050
that just-- that is constantly
remembering and growing.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.680
I love that idea.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.050
And, you know, another idea I really like

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.280
is the notion that comes from the Tibetan
s as well, this notion they call Terma,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.740
which-- my interpretation of it is
a word I might use as transmission.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.400
It means treasure.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.280
And Terma are like

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.380
teachings in a way,

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.960
or wisdom teachings, that are

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.810
waiting for specific teachers

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.140
in time and space.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.040
And the story

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.620
through the Tibetans is that a lot of the
Terma would-- their lineage Terma were

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.810
dropped by their great teacher
Padmasambhāva, who is the second Buddha,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.140
and he kind of emanated these
Termas into the future. And,

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.280
like, dropping them like-- kind
of a bit like depth charges,

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.420
you know? At different levels of depths

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.860
of time. And that they would
go off at certain points

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.530
where further emanations,
or disciples of his, or teachers,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:58.108
or really they're kind of aspects of his
greater consciousness, or that being,

00:19:58.308 --> 00:19:59.740
that lineage, you could say,

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:05.250
is better to say. And then they would pick
up and they would go off and be discovered

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.180
at certain times,
in certain places and periods.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.840
And this was a great

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.770
-- a big-- it was a big shift
in my understanding when I really

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.330
understood about these Terma, because
that's sort of what happened to me.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.440
I had this kind of opening up that was
just hanging there in time and space.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.380
And then this wisdom memory came rushing

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:30.500
through me, and then
I had to spend the rest of my life,

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:35.090
and I still am, figuring out what I'd
received, and living according to it.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.660
And I think that's

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:42.180
-- I mentioned it not just because it's
part of my story, but because

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:48.480
it's a lovely little sort of idea of
how subtle and rich are the layers

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.960
that survive time and space.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.570
That kind of, you know-- and it brings
us perhaps to that notion of involution

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.892
that we've been thinking about,

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:04.140
which-- maybe we could dive into
that a bit? What is involution, Chris?

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.000
Tell us.
Well,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.660
first of all.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.480
I want to stop for a moment,
and then first to celebrate

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.140
your receiving of the
Terma of the Gene Keys.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.770
You didn't make those,
you received those and you unpacked them.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.740
You take your responsibility
for your half, but you only have half.

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.570
The other half is like the seed
that comes from above.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.400
And once you understand that reincarnation

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.140
is a cycle that has a bottom half,
an incarnational half and a top half.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.810
And just as there are a community
of beings in the bottom half of the cycle,

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.465
there's also a community
of beings in the top half.

00:21:41.665 --> 00:21:44.810
That there's layers, and layers,
and layers of spiritual beings.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.420
It's not just reincarnating human beings,

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:51.780
but there's angelic presences,
and enlightened beings' presences, and all

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:57.620
sorts of beings who are here to help
us gestate in our gestational cycle.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.620
And so just as there are human beings

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.800
above

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.700
to help us, there are the teachings above
to help and infuse our teachings,

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:14.160
so that there are these gems
of ideas. Gems of empowerment

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.700
that-- And so once we have

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.660
the understanding that a human being
who becomes aware of the dynamics

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:27.620
of reincarnation, aware of the deep
evolutionary trajectory of the soul

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.020
and soul communities,
the way the Tibetans have,

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:36.660
then they naturally begin to track
their great beings through time.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.500
And they track the great
teachings through time.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:44.420
And they become sensitive to these
diamonds dropping into our minds

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:51.260
at specific-- and the deep
significant patterns to this process.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.080
So, for me, in addition to the detail

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.320
of these ideas of-- that there are
Termas, teachings, and that there are

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.000
Tulkus,

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.900
you know, self-consciously reincarnating

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:09.500
beings. The deeper fabric is
to understand-- begin to understand

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.940
the depth and the grandeur
at which reincarnation is operating.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:19.440
It's not simply a matter of who we
were in the 17th century.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.380
It's really a matter of-- it changes
the parameters of our dialogue

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.220
with the universe, and therefore

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:31.260
it changes our sense of what we are
. Because we are a being

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:32.780
that travels through time.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.180
We are a being that has absorbed, and been

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:41.400
in the spiritual world many times,
and we are incarnating more and more

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.330
of these diamond teachings

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.660
into our body,
into our heart, into our mind.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.760
And

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.860
that opens up the playing field

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.900
of human experience.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.380
I think it just opens up.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:55.920
And

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.080
I teach at a university,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.050
where the religion of secular

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.180
enlightenment is that
the universe appeared by chance.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.420
It's been driven by random mutation.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.220
There's no meaning to your life.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.460
It's all accidental.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.500
And when you die, you're dead, that's it.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.180
When your brain stops, you're dead.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.040
And that just completely--

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.330
it's just is such a crushing philosophy.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.020
But this,

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:26.180
which starts on an empirical basis
but then expands through a deeper

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:32.080
appreciation of the dynamics of spiritual
traditions, it restores meaning

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.290
back to our lives.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.500
It allows us to play
in a meaningful landscape

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:42.120
of engaging the wisdom of our life
with the wisdom of the universe,

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.700
entering.
And the involution is that downward flow

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.253
of meaning, and purpose, and beauty,
and truth, into our life.

00:24:51.453 --> 00:24:54.900
And then evolution
is our taking it and seeding it

00:24:54.930 --> 00:25:00.320
and growing it as best we can
into the circumstances of our life.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.639
I sometimes look at involution as
the future burrowing into the past,

00:25:08.839 --> 00:25:10.900
and evolution as the past

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.940
spiralling towards the future.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.620
So you've got these two forces.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.260
But you might also look at it as

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.900
like Aurobindo,

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.800
you know, who I know you also love,
Sri Aurobindo, amazing kind of mind,

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.360
and how he describes involution

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.380
as seeds kind of sown deep within matter.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.570
So, within matter,
the spirit is there asleep.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.720
Like, take a rock, like a piece of lump
of granite, or a volcano, or a mountain.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.520
You know, inside that mountain
is a sleeping

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.620
kind of consciousness of such beauty.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.260
But it's just waiting, it's waiting

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.880
for its time. You know,
and everything, like, a plant has it.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.080
And you can see a little bit more of it

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:59.660
in a plant, and in a bird you can see it
more clearly, like it's taking animation.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.700
And then a mammal, it's,

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:05.140
like, even more because it looks at you
in the eyes and it has-- even some of them

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.380
have that emotional flavour that humans
have, like dogs and horses.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.720
And then in a human, it's much more,
like, obvious because

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.320
you know, we can do this!

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.560
So the spirit is-- you know, there's
that notion that it's in, like,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.940
the gems that you speak of.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.900
Like, everything is a gem in matter.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:32.140
Every tiny atom contains
a seed of a spiritual truth,

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.050
and everything is waiting its time.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:39.000
Everything is on this evolutionary ladder

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.130
and where evolution meets involution
is kind of the eternal now.

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.460
Just constantly-- as you said,

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:50.960
constantly creating
and just recreating itself.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.560
And also from the notion
of involution and evolution

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.508
you can solve,

00:26:57.708 --> 00:27:02.660
at some way, I don't know if that's
the right word, but you can penetrate

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.740
the old chestnut of free
will and determinism.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.160
Because if you look at it
from the involution perspective,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.090
you might say,
'Well, it's all predetermined because it's

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.090
all just sitting there waiting for its
moment to come alive.' But from the view

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:21.080
of evolution, nothing is predetermined,
everything is being created

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.500
from this view.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:27.040
So the two of them together,
like a funnel meeting are like this--

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.920
that's the paradox for me,

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.570
of-- you know, that's divine science
that Aurobindo, by the way, just

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.940
you know really nailed.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.520
I mean, if you're able to read
him, which not everyone is!

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:44.250
It's a challenge!

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:49.980
Like, the layers of subtle nuance
in that man's mind-stream,

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:54.740
in terms of how he penetrated this
information, is extraordinary.

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.620
I know he's inspired both of us.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.120
Yes, he has.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.420
And I think you're right.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.200
I think in some ways

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.260
it's our everyday experience

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:11.050
that there are aspects of our life
which are highly conditioned.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.980
And it's our everyday experience

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.700
that we are not completely
subservient to those conditions.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:20.180
We have a cubic centimetre of free will,

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.290
which we can expand into a
cubic metre of free will.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.540
We choose how we choose to meet
the circumstances of our life.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.860
Whether we incubate choice,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.940
incubate a space
where we look at the options

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.570
and really examine deeply what we want

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:43.090
to do, what we want to be,
and enact out of that choice.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.140
And that's something we can expand on.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.460
I mean,
that's how I sort of see what you're doing

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.220
in Gene Keys, and correct me if I'm wrong,
you're helping people make

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:57.500
more informed choices, by giving them
an opportunity to sit deeply

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:01.380
with the core, the karmic core,
the swirl of their being.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:10.260
So they make choices on how to engage and
define the outcome of that score.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.330
Exactly.
Because in Gene Keys, it's very simple,

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.440
actually, because you have these
three layers, you know: the

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.520
Shadow, Gift and Siddhi, and

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.570
Siddhi is the involving seed.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.860
The way I describe it, often,
actually, is the Shadow is the seed.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:33.500
The Gift is in the centre, is the fruit
-- is the flower, and then the Siddhi

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.880
is the fruit,
and the fruit also contains the seed.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:45.040
There's this whole process of awakening
inside us, where the Shadow suddenly--

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.620
you know, our-- what we learn from our

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:52.080
karma, what we learn from our mistakes,
what we learn from our challenges,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.000
becomes this incredible treasure.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:03.500
And as we unlock it and forgive ourselves,
and learn and evolve, then,

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.020
you know, we begin to kind of access
those heightened states of consciousness.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.660
They're actually buried

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.420
in those very dense places in creation.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:17.880
And that's our role as humans,
to kind of find those dense places

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.780
and be an intermediary
to help unlock them.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.810
So that's an incredible responsibility.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.920
Yeah.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.120
My sense is over the course of long time,

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.620
the shadow seeds become less.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.720
They get evaporated

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.860
in the process of reflective awareness.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:44.780
And so the creative seeds become more,
and the opportunity

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:51.900
to become increasingly transparent to the
intelligence of the universe increase.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.780
And if we extrapolate that,

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.330
if that's true,
not only for us individually

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.900
but collectively,
and clearly the human race has a long way

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.380
to go before it makes
all of its shadow seeds,

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:09.140
because it seems like we have so many
shadow seeds that are driving us now.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.260
But if we just step back and give
the benefit of the doubt,

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:16.500
and assume that what happens
for the individual, which we've seen,

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:21.290
can happen for the collective.
And that humanity as a whole

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.810
is in the process, through these

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:31.460
magnificent, deep collective dynamics, of
cooking its past seeds and transcending

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.620
its-- the limitations of its past,

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:39.540
and moving forward in time.
Then we have reasons to hope that--

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.980
what the greatness
of beings, that we see in

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.540
Tulkus, into intimate dialogue

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.500
with Termas,
is something that all of humanity

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:54.064
is aspiring to, and all
of humanity can become.

00:31:54.264 --> 00:31:55.800
That we can become

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.760
-- we are in the process
of becoming a truly--

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:06.912
a species of enlightened beings,
a species where we live in the light,

00:32:07.112 --> 00:32:09.980
more than living in the shadows.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.940
I think we're coming out of the shadows

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:16.620
of history into a deeper, deeper,
better tomorrow.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:21.140
Particularly as we start to understand
the universe a little bit more, or

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:24.540
the parameters of the universe,
and we look out.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.660
You know, I know you've got some wonderful
slides you want to share,

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:32.160
which I think would be a great
backdrop if you want to share them.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.810
When I think about the topics
that we're talking about today,

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.780
like - where is reincarnation taking us?

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:44.040
What is the larger scope
and purpose of rebirth?

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.780
I just collect these pictures

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:49.960
from the NASA, they send them around
every day, and I collect them,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.460
and I meditate on these pictures.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.780
I try to envision the enormous distances

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:03.120
involved and the millions and billions
of stars that are involved.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.330
And the life that's burgeoning on

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.420
so many of these planets,
in so many of these systems.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.200
So that the sheer

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.320
fertility,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:21.120
the profligate fertility
of the universe, and the scale

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:27.360
that the universe is thinking of
in order to create and to manifest

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:34.880
orders, and orders, and orders
of evolving life on this magnitude.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.000
And then

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.460
to appreciate that we are part of this.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.520
This

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.020
has been the great,

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:48.420
great burden of a one-time-through
metaphysics, the belief that we--

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:52.320
this genius and beauty that we're
seeing in these pictures,

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.660
if our life is meaningless,

00:33:54.690 --> 00:34:00.180
and if it's all random chance, we don't
get to participate in this greatness.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.140
But if reincarnation is true,

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:08.060
and if we are really not limited
by the time that this little body lives,

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:13.460
and if our mind is going to grow
for countless, countless, countless

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:15.000
incarnations,

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.400
then

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.040
we become intimately part of

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:27.960
the generative creativity that we see
around us in these vast, magnificent

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.560
images

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.340
of the universe.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.960
And this then becomes our
playground, you know,

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.380
without the physical body,
this is surely where we live.

00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:41.650
This is our playground.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.131
And it could be even within
the physical body, you know,

00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:48.980
at some deep level,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.141
as a hologram,

00:34:50.341 --> 00:34:55.361
you know. That could be a deep truth
that we come to, you know,

00:34:55.561 --> 00:34:58.880
the 'as above, so below' truth.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.500
And I know you've experienced some

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:04.100
of that yourself in your experience, your,
you know, journeys.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.580
And so have I.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:09.120
It's a fundamental truth I hold
at the core of my being, you know,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.980
and in my teachings, also.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.100
Like I-- we have this profile
called a Hologenetic profile.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.200
And I name it that because

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.420
it is a map of the inner
workings of our being.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.520
But

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.440
it kind of has a fractal

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.720
reality that corresponds way beyond

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.400
this

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:41.640
micro-organism here, of one body. It
is replicated throughout the cosmos.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.000
Yeah.
Yeah a lot of the great

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:51.940
super-alchemical teachings of the Taoists,
for example, have explored this in their

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:55.459
deep, you know, studies
of-- and meditations.

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:57.940
Where you go within and you find

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.480
the galaxies and the stars,
and where they exist

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.920
in the glands of the body and how
everything has a correspondence.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.840
And therefore,
knowing those correspondences

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:20.126
allows your awareness to travel into that
reality and outside your physical body.

00:36:20.326 --> 00:36:23.920
That's, you know, as many people have,

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.980
well, experienced that in dreams,

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:31.273
or in astral projection, or deep
meditation, or psychedelic journeying.

00:36:31.473 --> 00:36:35.720
I mean, feel free to share some
of your experiences in that.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.500
Well,

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.980
I've done that as carefully as I can in my
book 'LSD and the Mind of the Universe'.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:44.040
But I think the invitation

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.280
is to appreciate

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.840
-- I mean, look, we only became

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
conscious of the mother universe about
5000 years ago. We began to have

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.440
sufficient discipline
to drop beneath the conditioning

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.820
of our individual egoic mind,
and to tap into that stream

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.480
of consciousness that we
share with all life.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.221
We've been walking upright
for 5.8 million years,

00:37:10.421 --> 00:37:14.680
we've only-- we've been operating
with our larger brain about

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.820
200,000 years.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.380
Writing came in about 5000 years ago.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.650
The Upanishadic breakthroughs
came in about

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.640
3000-4000 years ago.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.690
But these are nothing

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:33.260
compared to the billions and billions
of years that lie ahead of us.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.100
We're just waking up.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:37.500
We're just waking up to who we are.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.460
And so, naturally, we kind of

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.690
get confused given the enormity
of what we're going into.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.900
But I think the meditation exercises
that you're describing in those

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.740
philosophical and spiritual traditions,
which have begun to recognise

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:57.425
the correspondence between
the above and the below,

00:37:57.625 --> 00:38:03.540
naturally, we begin to enter into
exercises where we intentionally,

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.120
sort of, reinforce

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.500
the hybrid nature of our life. That we are

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:13.100
a spiritual being,
and we are a physical being.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.170
We are both pure light,
and we are pure green.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.690
And there are correspondences
in our body which correspond

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.418
to the realities out there.

00:38:24.618 --> 00:38:28.820
And the more we can internalise
and reinforce them and strengthen them

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:34.520
in our meditational exercises,
then we become a more conscious

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.130
mixing pot.
A more conscious

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.120
kind of mortar and pestle,
integrating the above and the below.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.680
And if we keep this up for a few
tens of thousands of years,

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.900
and a few millions of years, I mean I--

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.420
sometimes I tell my students the only
serious question we should be asking

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:58.600
ourselves is - what do you
want to be in a million years?

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.580
Because you're going to be here
in a million years.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:05.300
So let's get down to it.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.580
What is our deepest heart's desire?

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.130
What can we do?

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.040
The fundamental question.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.580
I heard, a couple of weeks ago,

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:20.040
I heard a really interesting talk
by Roger Penrose, you know him?

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:27.040
Really imaginative,
top-level physicist in the world today.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.000
And he was saying how--

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.520
because

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.300
there's this notion that the universe,
as it's expanding in physics,

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.380
it's getting further,
and further apart and slowing down.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:40.060
It's going to reach steady-state.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:45.820
And then we're all going to end up in this
kind of slightly distant, dead, lonely

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.720
kind of stopping point.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.316
And that wasn't his-- that's
not his intuition.

00:39:54.516 --> 00:39:55.100
Or, at least,

00:39:55.130 --> 00:40:00.040
the way he describes it, is that when
you reach that stopping point,

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.740
it's the same as if you've gone incredibly

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.080
fast. As if everything's
come together again,

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.620
because one end of the spectrum
meets the other end of the spectrum.

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:12.820
So you wouldn't be able to tell
if things are slowing down.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:16.840
It actually might be that they look
like they're speeding up. And,

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.900
anyway, so this is my paraphrasing
what he said.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:28.200
But the thing that really blew me away,
from a physicist to say, was that he said

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.280
the way he would understand
it is that the logic

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.200
and the kind of elegance
of the universe would be such that that

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:47.136
kind of condensing point would then give
birth to another universe, out of itself.

00:40:47.336 --> 00:40:48.880
Like, which seems to be

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.420
the-- an elegant logic that the universe
already does,

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:57.130
as we started by saying rebirth and then
leads to another birth. And another aeon.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.260
But then he even went further, and he said

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.300
the background radiation

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:07.900
that we see with-- through our furthest
telescopes, that can now see, like,

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.020
the very, very beginnings of the universe.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.740
He said there are certain objects

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.482
that we're seeing in there, and I can't
quite remember what he called them,

00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:19.650
but there are certain shapes
and patterns and things that you're

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.820
seeing, and you see them
over and over again.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.880
And

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.800
his assumption

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.100
was that those were the leftovers
from the previous aeon,

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.600
from the previous universe
that we're seeing,

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.540
and that really blew me away.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:37.120
I was like, 'Wow,

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.320
that's from a physicist!'

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:43.580
Who's willing to
kind of-- who's kind of reached the top

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:47.160
of his game, he's able
to kind of take a few leaps.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.560
But that really seemed
to me to be [inaudible].

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.060
I've heard Ervin László describe

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.980
the-- once you reflect
on the extraordinary precision

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:04.060
of the unfolding of our
universe in the Big Bang,

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:10.170
the magnitude of the perfection
of the balance of elements that had to be

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.760
present in the first picoseconds
for it to unfold as it has,

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.000
then

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.944
his hypothesis was,

00:42:19.144 --> 00:42:24.480
'Well, do we think that this is the
first time the universe has tried this?'

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.340
There have been expansions
and contractions,

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.820
and expansions and contractions,
and the universe is learning.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.880
And

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.540
perhaps this isn't the first Big Bang.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:38.900
Perhaps this is the 1000th Big Bang.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:43.280
And it's gotten-- it's learned
from its previous experiences,

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:48.130
and that's that background radiation,
the traces of which are there.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.780
It's constantly ironing out flaws, and

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.540
perfecting, and perfecting,
and perfecting itself.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.600
Yeah.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.720
Of course

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.780
this wide view.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.860
I think it's rich to take the wide view,

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:05.420
to take the deep view,
and to look at very special developed

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:10.340
beings who are kind of pushing the edge
of this large view.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.650
But I want to bring it back down to -

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.940
Okay, how does this
impact me, here, today?

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:20.780
How does this help me live
with the immediate problems

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:26.540
that I'm dealing with, or with the
immediate choices that I'm living with?

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:32.840
And I think it does, in the sense that
by-- it's an invitation

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:39.620
to look at our life
as an intentional, intelligent

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:46.160
convocation of circumstances,
not as a meaningless and not as a

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.700
blind, deterministic
combination of circumstances.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:55.770
And if we engage our life circumstances as a--

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.400
an intentional challenge

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.495
chosen us-- chosen for us, by us,

00:44:01.695 --> 00:44:04.020
at a time when we knew more,

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:09.300
and we start to make choices in terms
of-- out of a deeper sense of engagement.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.340
That our choice does matter.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.100
Even if we don't see how it changes

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:19.580
things immediately, we can trust that it
does change things in the long term.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.000
Then I think

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.300
we will find that life changes,
the circumstances of our life changes.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:31.440
Things that were hard become soft,
things that were barren becomes richer.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.940
That's your experience
I'm sure with Gene Keys.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.560
Yeah.
And it gives

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.560
us like-- for me, it gives us

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.100
like a different kind of backdrop

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:47.780
with which to
tackle the problems of the world.

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:54.040
So the problems that we see today
around us, that worry us so much,

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:59.180
it gives us an empowered view
from a much wider view.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:44:59.700
Like, to look at what we've just been

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:02.780
looking at, those
cosmic background images.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.580
And then you come to the world today

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:09.160
and you look at this tiny little
blue planet, with its problems,

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.280
and, you know-- and they're very real

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.980
and they're causing
a great deal of suffering.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.260
They always have done.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.320
But

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.000
they're now more easily
seen than ever before.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.480
And we've enacted them globally
because of our technology.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.840
So

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.380
we are, you know-- it means that, for me,

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:34.460
I'm constantly reminding people that,
you know, action that comes

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:41.200
from a state of trust is very different
from action that comes from fear.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.210
If we can dive into that field of wider

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.060
trust, and we begin to make friends
with our own death. You know,

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:54.140
instead of being-- it being something
that's kind of like, 'Ugh, it's coming.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:55.920
You know, I'm running out of time.'

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.900
Instead of, like, that view, and having
this long-term view as an individual.

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:04.140
And even, like, what I'm doing

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.600
as a community,

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.940
how about if a whole community
of people on the same wavelength

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:14.210
play with this together? Like,
we're all going to come back,

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.060
you know, we're going to return,
and we're going to return into this same

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:20.660
-- I mean this is why I've
created these teachings

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.200
-- I haven't created them, they've
appeared,

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.600
because

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.100
we can come back into them.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.700
And we can begin to, like

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.420
-- and the teachings
are just the teachings.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:35.180
They're just enable us to kind-- to give
a focal point so that we can do our work,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:41.210
our continuous, progressive
evolutionary work as communities,

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:45.020
rather than like, 'Okay, you've done
this great work, and then you've gone.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:48.055
And yeah, I might be reborn, but where?'

00:46:48.255 --> 00:46:54.140
If you're born into the same community
of beings, of souls, who are all committed

00:46:54.170 --> 00:47:00.140
to transmuting karma of the planet,
and come in with different gifts, and

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.866
genius, and skills,
in different locations around the world,

00:47:04.066 --> 00:47:07.380
but we're interconnected
through the Internet, and through

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:11.820
our body of teachings that kind of
have a resonance in our soul.

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:15.660
So we recognise them again,
even as a child.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:20.720
You know, and synchronicity
helps us to find them. Suddenly,

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.340
it's a different playground again!

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:28.080
You don't have to say goodbye
to all your loved ones forever.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.500
You're going to remember them in different

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:34.580
way-- you're going to bring
more of that awareness

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.100
down through the transitionary
Bardo. And bring it--

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.420
and the more of us do that,

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:44.600
that incarnate the memory through
the Bardos forwards in time, the more

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.956
it kind-- this is my intuition,

00:47:50.156 --> 00:47:52.120
the more it will open up

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.037
the Bardos themselves,

00:47:54.237 --> 00:47:57.997
so that more and more
people can remember.

00:47:58.197 --> 00:48:00.955
And it's all a game of memory, I think,

00:48:01.155 --> 00:48:04.420
that, you know, like, the more awareness we-- the

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:08.900
more we play and participate,
the more that memory opens up.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.580
Because memory is
a strange thing, isn't it?

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.920
Like, even individual memory?

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.320
You can-- there are memory tricks
you can do, to, you know--

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:22.180
and therapeutically you can take
someone back into their memories.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:25.820
So there are things that you can do
to enhance memory.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.980
And there are things you can do

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.700
forwards in time to ensure
that you don't forget.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:31.820
There

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.280
are triggers,
you know, that you can-- I mean,

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.740
there are lots of ways of playing

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:44.020
with this, but there are things you can do
as the Lamas do, you know, the Tulkus.

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:47.000
They sometimes leave objects

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.800
that they retrieve in the next life.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.560
You know, and there are lots of tricks.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.440
Within-- once you know, the time-- you know once you've
kind of found a way through the wormholes,

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.280
I think you can play more.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.943
And then we can
bring more and more awakening,

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:08.280
you know, into the collective.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.180
You know, and I think
that that changes everything.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:11.820
It does.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:17.300
I think we're shifting slowly from
living an ego-based life which is grounded

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:20.900
in this incarnation,
to living a soul-life

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:25.700
which is grounded into this much,
much deeper life in the universe.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:30.540
It always struck me as significant
that in the classical story

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:35.615
of the Buddha's enlightenment and he went
through the four watches of the night,

00:49:35.815 --> 00:49:39.840
in one of the watches of the night,
he saw all of his former lives.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.210
They all became living
part of his awareness.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.280
Now,

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:48.140
to see your former lives,
to remember your former lives.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:51.980
It's not simply to remember who you were,

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.400
but you bring all of that life
experience into who you are.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:02.520
So for me to see, to remember your
former lives, is to become the soul

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.940
which gathers all that knowledge
and all that experience into one place.

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:14.520
And when he did that, he became
transparent and shattered.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.340
He stopped the suffering.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:18.380
And the suffering is fundamentally

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:24.660
living small, living as if this
body is the only thing that is you.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.980
And I think this is
happening historically.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.260
We are-- as you say,
the more we bring that memory forward,

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:35.900
the more we live that memory, the more
we see that memory into the future.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:41.708
Another way of saying this is to say
- we are practising the skills of soul,

00:50:41.908 --> 00:50:43.380
inside time and space.

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:47.520
And as our soul gets stronger,
we begin to remember

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.140
and have an intuitive feeling

00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:52.980
for relationships
that we have a deeper history with.

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:57.540
And if people come at us as enemies,
well, let's heal them.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:00.420
I'm sorry what I did to you,
whatever it was,

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:02.060
let me make it up to you.

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:05.520
But more and more allies come.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.260
Because there's a-- waking
up is a social process.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:15.860
It's a generative process which has never,
ever been private, at any time in history.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.580
And I think this is what's happening.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:20.180
I think the soul

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.960
is waking up

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.040
inside time and space.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:25.920
That the human species

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.580
is basically growing up

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:33.380
on a scale the likes of which is really

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:39.620
comparable about like 200,000 years ago
when we made the jump to our bigger brain.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:43.340
Except now the physical
plant isn't changing.

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:45.260
But the awareness that is supported

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:50.160
by the physical plant seems
to be changing exponentially.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.620
So I know that you and I share a vision

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:57.780
of history, that we're entering into
a very, very challenging time,

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.380
a time of darkening shadows.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:05.820
So I hope in our next conversation,
we can begin to put together

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:10.940
our understanding of the dynamics of this
period of history that we're venturing,

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:15.980
and the dynamics of soul growth.
That we both affirm so deeply.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.640
Yeah.
And how those two fit perfectly together

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.340
and what you call the birth
of the diamond soul.

00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:26.120
And I also happen to call
it the diamond-awareness.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:30.980
And it is that memory
that transcends the lifetimes.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.040
And

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.960
that maintaining that memory
between lives, it sure is-- I mean,

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.993
for one thing,

00:52:42.193 --> 00:52:43.360
suddenly

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.380
many people who I'm engaged with,

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:50.928
like, they're suddenly excited
by being here, and by returning.

00:52:51.128 --> 00:52:56.020
As opposed to 'I want to get out
of here,' which has been the prevalent

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:59.210
kind of feeling among
spiritual communities.

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.501
'I want to get out of here.

00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:05.520
You know, this is my last
incarnation, I'm off.'

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.700
And that's-- I think there's a more

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:15.486
compassionate view,
and I think a more exciting view.

00:53:15.686 --> 00:53:15.920
That

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.960
we can actually bring-- you know and

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.660
it's like a warrior's view as well.

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:24.400
Spiritual warrior. Like,
this place needs us,

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.620
it needs us here to do this work.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.680
So

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.800
yeah I think that's why we're

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.980
having these conversations, for me.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:34.780
I don't think the creative genius

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:39.020
that gave birth to the galaxies,
and planets inside the galaxies,

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:44.060
and solar systems, would inculcate--
and it created reincarnation.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.420
We didn't create it.
The religions didn't create it.

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:47.660
Nature created it.

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:52.580
And I don't think it would create
reincarnation to grow us to an awareness

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:57.560
of our first inkling of our deep,
deep spiritual essence,

00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.020
with the purpose being, 'Okay, then you

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:03.580
can go, then you can go.'
I think we've missed it.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:06.960
We don't understand that awakening

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.380
is part of-- it is a process which
really is part of the transformation

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:15.380
of time and space itself.
That we are here to change.

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:17.540
We are changing the world.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:22.600
It really is heaven on Earth,
is what the process is about.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.300
Yeah, and the prophecy.
And the prophecy, yeah.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.540
Let's leave that as a seed for next time.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.700
That sounds good.
Wonderful.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.280
Thank you, Chris.
What a fantastic [inaudible].

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.180
And I'll just leave with this thought.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:38.020
I wonder what our personal former-life

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:44.560
history is, that we meet in such ease
and fruitful dialogue, you and I

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.780
. And so I honour the history
between us, whatever it is.

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:49.340
I will contemplate that.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.440
Yeah.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.700
Much love.
Great.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:52.960
Thank you.

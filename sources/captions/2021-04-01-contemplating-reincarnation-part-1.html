<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset='utf-8'><link rel='stylesheet' href='/chris-bache-archive/assets/style.css'></head><body><p>Welcome, everyone,</p>
<p>to a series of talks that I'm doing here with my friend Chris Bache,</p>
<p>and we're going to be discussing a subject that we're both really interested</p>
<p>in and fascinated by, which is rebirth and all the things</p>
<p>that go along with rebirth. Might also call it reincarnation,</p>
<p>because that's part of the story. And this began, really,</p>
<p>because I read a book by Chris, a wonderful book called 'LSD</p>
<p>and the Mind of the Universe'. And what it did is it kind of just</p>
<p>triggered a real recognition in me. And since I'm a teacher of spiritual matters and I'm the founder</p>
<p>of a system called the Gene Keys, that resonance that went off in me, it caused me to reach out via</p>
<p>email to this amazing man. And you never know whether you're</p>
<p>going to hear back in those instances. And Chris very kindly got back to me</p>
<p>and we started a series of dialogues and discussions, and we realised that we</p>
<p>really enjoyed having dialogues together. So that's why we're here. And we're going to explore this</p>
<p>subject in several sessions. So, today, we're going to just begin with some introductory concepts and basics</p>
<p>and then see where it leaves us. So I hope you enjoy it and I'm</p>
<p>very much looking forward to it. And we're anticipating three discussions.</p>
<p>Absolutely. So Chris, if you want to say a few things about yourself, just so that</p>
<p>people know who you are. It's a pleasure to meet here. And I've enjoyed our conversations</p>
<p>that we've had prior to this. And this present dialogue grew out</p>
<p>of those earlier conversations. I am a professor of philosophy</p>
<p>and religious studies. I'm on the religious</p>
<p>studies side of the shop. I'm retired from Youngstown</p>
<p>State University. In the course of my teaching, I've taught courses on world religions</p>
<p>and Eastern religions, transpersonal psychology of religion</p>
<p>and comparative mysticism, Buddhism. So I've been teaching in areas touching</p>
<p>on reincarnation for many years. I have written several books. My first one was on reincarnation,</p>
<p>starting with the scientific evidence for reincarnation, which</p>
<p>we'll be touching on today. And it's been seminal in my thinking. And I just believe that reincarnation is one of those concepts that is</p>
<p>like plate tectonics. If you-- at first it's hard to see because it's not obvious, but, once you</p>
<p>see it, it changes everything. It changes so much, it opens</p>
<p>up the horizon of existence. So we thought this would be a good topic to have a shared conversation about</p>
<p>and I'm just real pleased to be here. Great.</p>
<p>Thanks, Chris. And I mean,</p>
<p>we'll put the link in afterwards, but there's some great things,</p>
<p>talks that you've done, and particularly one which I watched</p>
<p>fairly recently about 'Is there evidence for reincarnation?'</p>
<p>And it's so illuminating and extraordinary, and kind</p>
<p>of overlooked by so many people. Tell us some of</p>
<p>the, you know, your story in assembling and amassing that, some of that evidence,</p>
<p>or meeting other people that have. Well, you know, I came from a traditional</p>
<p>religious background, but over the course of many years</p>
<p>of graduate education I finished my doctoral work in philosophy religion,</p>
<p>as an atheistically inclined agnostic. Basically I'd studied my way</p>
<p>out of religion altogether. So I started my academic career as a young man, a long time ago in 1978,</p>
<p>and I met there the work of two people, in my first year, and both of them</p>
<p>changed the course of my life. The first was Ian Stevenson, the Carlson Professor at the University</p>
<p>of Virginia, whose lifelong work has been to provide carefully documented cases</p>
<p>that clearly-- of young children, small children who have spontaneous</p>
<p>memories of their previous life. And then researching these children</p>
<p>from all over the world, collecting thousands of cases,</p>
<p>publishing hundreds of cases. And he convinced me that reincarnation</p>
<p>was a simple fact of life. That's quite a book, isn't it?</p>
<p>That's a big book he's written. The book. He's written about, oh,</p>
<p>I think close to a dozen now, but this first one was called '20</p>
<p>Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation'. And, to me, it was a life pivot, because reincarnation was never</p>
<p>discussed in my graduate education. It was never discussed in the West</p>
<p>religions, or in the scientific tradition that had kind of wiped the slate clean</p>
<p>for-- of the religious traditions. So I just erased my blackboard and began to rethink again the larger questions</p>
<p>of life incorporating reincarnation. The second person I met at that time was Stanislav Grof,</p>
<p>who is the foremost authority on integrating psychedelics</p>
<p>into psychotherapy. And he was providing a methodology</p>
<p>that actually allows one to explore the deeper dimensions</p>
<p>of one's own consciousness. So that began a whole 'nother journey, a second journey which culminated</p>
<p>eventually in the publication of this book Richard mentioned,</p>
<p>'LSD in the Mind of the Universe'. But today the focus here is</p>
<p>on Ian Stevenson's - what he started in the revolution</p>
<p>of really providing carefully documented evidence that reincarnation is</p>
<p>just simply a fact of life. It's not a religious thing. It's not a-- it's simply a natural</p>
<p>phenomenon that's happening in the world. And in your talk you gave,</p>
<p>again which the link will be here-- as a wonderful, you know, years spent as an academic,</p>
<p>you kind of argue both sides. So you show how different people have come in and even written books to refute those</p>
<p>things, but how they've fallen short. And so there's this whole story around it. And there's this growing body of evidence,</p>
<p>that maybe in the last 50 years has been documented, I mean it's</p>
<p>fairly recent, isn't it? It is recent. 50 years ago, we didn't</p>
<p>have this evidence. It was still-- reincarnation was a speculative topic that the theologians</p>
<p>argued back and forth on. But now it's moved from the theologians'</p>
<p>table to the psychologists' table. And now, as we explore more deeply, the deeper levels of consciousness</p>
<p>in the depth-psychology tradition, we just find we're bumping into th</p>
<p>ese events over and over again. Now, the western philosophical tradition, of course, is kind of still saturated</p>
<p>with the metaphysical position of naturalism, which says, 'The only thing</p>
<p>which is real is that which is physical.' So, therefore, the brain</p>
<p>produces your mind. So obviously, in that system, once your brain dies, your mind 'psss'</p>
<p>[makes sound effect] ceases to exist. So it's impossible for there to be</p>
<p>something like reincarnation, because it implies a dimension of reality</p>
<p>that's behind the physical world. If you exist there for any-- consciousness</p>
<p>can exist there for any interval of time , between the death of one personality</p>
<p>and the birth of a second personality. So, naturally, there's been a real push back from philosophical</p>
<p>traditions in the West. Mostly they've just ignored the evidence. They don't look at it,</p>
<p>and even those who look at it and engage it, the foremost critic that I mentioned</p>
<p>in my talk was a man named Paul Edwards, a substantial American philosopher,</p>
<p>even in his work - the evidence really a careful, dispassionate analysis</p>
<p>of the debate between Ian Stevenson on the one hand,</p>
<p>and Paul Edwards on the other hand, is that he just refuses to look seriously</p>
<p>at the evidence, because he's convinced beforehand that the evidence must</p>
<p>be somehow faulty, because we know that reincarnation can't happen. Yeah, of course, and that's often the way</p>
<p>with academics sometimes, isn't it? And, you know, a great-- you know, so that's, like, that's really</p>
<p>interesting in itself, just the evidence. And I don't think we need to kind of go</p>
<p>any more into that now but it's-- I guess what are the implications, you know, if we do-- Because this year I've done</p>
<p>a series of videos myself, short ones, just exploring the implications of 'What</p>
<p>if I say yes to this concept, and I explore it?' You know,</p>
<p>if I open my mind and my heart to it, and I begin to really</p>
<p>deeply explore it. You know, the implications to our world view, and the way we</p>
<p>move through life is huge, isn't it? Yeah. It all hinges on time. How much time we have. Because if you</p>
<p>have a sense of-- well, let me back up. I'm a professor. So if I give a quiz in class, I can expect</p>
<p>a certain quality of an answer back. If I give an exam that takes an hour,</p>
<p>I expect a higher quality of response. And if it's a take-home research paper, I have higher expectations, still,</p>
<p>because they have more time. So, philosophically, if we believe we only live on Earth one time,</p>
<p>and we only have in some cases a few minutes, to as many as 100 years,</p>
<p>and we extrapolate from that - if there is a purpose to existence,</p>
<p>that purpose must be proportionate to the amount of time we</p>
<p>have to fulfil that purpose. But if we have a hundred lifetimes,</p>
<p>a thousand lifetimes, in which to actualise the purpose</p>
<p>of the universe, then I think it expands exponentially our potential assessment of</p>
<p>what the purpose of existence might be. And that's why it's such an important</p>
<p>philosophical discussion, because once you understand the dynamics</p>
<p>of reincarnation, once you grasp the fundamental principle,</p>
<p>then it lifts the constriction of time, and it allows us to begin to think</p>
<p>in terms of, and appreciate and understand,</p>
<p>the larger patterns of the pulse of cause and effect overarching</p>
<p>over centuries of time. And it just elevates the whole discussion.</p>
<p>Absolutely. And I think, like-- you know, if I can be</p>
<p>blunt, like, if you have an inherent sense of a divinity</p>
<p>behind creation, then it seems logical to extend that into,</p>
<p>you know, that this concept of generosity. Because if you had a divinity and you only</p>
<p>have one life, it's very stingy, it seems. Like, it doesn't seem to have any</p>
<p>kind of pattern or reason to it. You know, it's like, for me, life is just-- spirit is just filled</p>
<p>with generosity in terms of time. And if we kind of open to the eternal</p>
<p>nature of life, then of course that would make sense, for</p>
<p>there to be a continuity of consciousness. And I think that, you know,</p>
<p>the more people open to this, the more they kind of realise it</p>
<p>has some deep root inside them. You know, I discovered that a lot because I've</p>
<p>begun to talk about it more and more. And one of the things I realised is no one</p>
<p>else really much-- other than people who are doing past-life regression</p>
<p>therapeutically, a lot of the teachers and spiritual teachers in the world</p>
<p>today avoid this subject. I mean, I don't know if they consciously</p>
<p>avoid it, but they don't talk about it. I mean, they get asked questions,</p>
<p>but then their answers are kind of generally quite short,</p>
<p>and it doesn't get picked up. So, yeah, I'm really interested</p>
<p>in something that is passed over that is so obvious, and it should be</p>
<p>in plain view for all of us. Isn't that curious? I mean,</p>
<p>I understand why my colleagues at the University who tended to be</p>
<p>you know materialists and reductionists. That I understand. But why spiritual teachers</p>
<p>wouldn't talk about it? Or wouldn't use it to sort of frame a larger and expanded horizon? Sometimes</p>
<p>I've heard people say, 'Well, it can dilute your intensity</p>
<p>of commitments for realisation in the present.' But, you know,</p>
<p>if you think you have many lifetimes and you're not going to take</p>
<p>this lifetime as seriously. But I think that argument kind of evaporates quickly</p>
<p>once you look at it carefully. I think it deepens the textures of the</p>
<p>situations in which we find ourselves in. And let me just give you one example. Some of the research,</p>
<p>Michael Newton's research, for example, in his book 'Journeys of the Soul' and</p>
<p>'Destiny of Souls', he and other past life therapists have found evidence</p>
<p>that we choose our incarnation. Now, I think in some ways many people don't, they may kind of go very</p>
<p>haphazardly and take what's available, but as you get mature,</p>
<p>you choose your incarnation carefully. Now, if we choose our incarnation carefully,</p>
<p>when there was a time when we knew more than we know now, and we could see more</p>
<p>than we could see now, if we chose the life that we're living</p>
<p>now, with all of its ups and downs and challenges and opportunities,</p>
<p>then doesn't that change how we might relate to those very circumstances</p>
<p>in which we find ourselves? You know, not to go chasing</p>
<p>all sorts of hidden mission-- you know, hidden meanings,</p>
<p>but to basically temper the quality of the self-responsibility that we use</p>
<p>in how we engage the people that we're with, the circumstances</p>
<p>that we find ourselves in. Yeah.</p>
<p>And doesn't it make you also-- I mean, for me, it makes me feel more like</p>
<p>a kind of eternal, cosmic adventurer. So, you know, it enrichens</p>
<p>this time I'm in now. It actually, in</p>
<p>many ways it focuses me a lot more into the present, because I'm not worrying</p>
<p>about dying, if you know what I mean. It changes that. And it's not just a concept. You know, have to go-- you know, this is my understanding, through my teaching,</p>
<p>is you have to contemplate something very deeply like this, for it to start</p>
<p>to kind of take root in you. And then as it takes root in you, it brings out of your-- literally,</p>
<p>I feel the truth of it is in our DNA. It's, like, in us. So once that gets triggered,</p>
<p>that kind of awakening of the memory, it-- there's a sort of certainty and a stability that grows inside us,</p>
<p>that enables us to handle whatever challenges come to us in a really</p>
<p>much more powerful way, because we're rooted in this kind</p>
<p>of eternal acceptance of this. You know, you hear</p>
<p>it all the time, on people on the radio. I heard last week, like, someone just</p>
<p>saying, 'Well, you've only got one life. So you've got to, you know, really make</p>
<p>the most of it.' Which is a great thing to say, but it's also, you</p>
<p>have only got one life. It's just, I</p>
<p>keep coming back to, that's really a tight kind of reality from whichever belief</p>
<p>system you're operating out of. Cuts the legs right out from under you. Because correlating with that is usually</p>
<p>the ideas of: you exist and the universe is being driven by blind chance,</p>
<p>it's just random mutation, there's no existential significance</p>
<p>to the circumstances in which you find yourself in, so you only get one shot,</p>
<p>make the best of it, but then when you die, it's gone,</p>
<p>you're gone anyway, so who cares? And that's just such a demeaning and counterintuitive</p>
<p>philosophy of life. Because I think when we look at the beauties of nature,</p>
<p>when we look at the night sky, when we see the pictures from the Hubble</p>
<p>telescope of the magnificent patterns in the deep cosmos, when we look around us</p>
<p>at Earth and look at the depth of the emergence of life and the emergence</p>
<p>of self-awareness on the planet over time, all these projects take place</p>
<p>over enormous sweeps of time. And we are the first generation to really</p>
<p>appreciate how much time the universe has had to be evolving</p>
<p>into the form that it is. Now, if the universe and everything it's</p>
<p>doing takes enormous amounts of time and we only have one life,</p>
<p>then existentially, we're cut off. We're not-- we don't participate</p>
<p>in that massive project. But if we do part-- if we live multiple lifetimes, there's a good</p>
<p>news - bad news situation. You know, the bad news is, you know, well, it's hard work in this lifetime, and we'd</p>
<p>like to have it over with when we die. But if we keep coming back, you know,</p>
<p>there's a larger project afoot. You know, it's not a simple grade,</p>
<p>like we thought it was before. It's a whole university education. The good news is you're right. It drops away, the fear</p>
<p>of death drops away. I mean, it just drops away. The good news is it allows us to envision a deeper-- to feel into the deeper</p>
<p>currents of life and the deeper projects. And it allows us to begin to think</p>
<p>in terms of longer term projects. And I think this is one of the things you</p>
<p>see when people take to heart this idea, even without specific knowledge</p>
<p>of their former lives. I mean, that's interesting.</p>
<p>And that can be helpful. But even without that,</p>
<p>when you really let that in, and you look around you and you realise that every</p>
<p>person you're seeing has been here before and will be here again, it just allows</p>
<p>you to engage life with so much more meaning and intensity of the process. You know,</p>
<p>what we are good at are things we have practised in the past,</p>
<p>things that we are just getting started on are things will get</p>
<p>better at in the future. And we can think we have that much time. We can think in terms</p>
<p>of that larger landscape. Yeah and of course, you know, we're not-- you know, there are many great thinkers and philosophers</p>
<p>and sages who have come to the same conclusion about rebirth. And</p>
<p>notably among them in the West, because we can talk a little</p>
<p>bit about the Eastern views. It's pretty common in the East. But Jung is someone who obviously springs,</p>
<p>like, straight up into the centre fray, because he's a bit</p>
<p>more contemporary. And, you know, he's been this pillar of modern</p>
<p>psychology, in the way in which we now understand the unconscious, and</p>
<p>the collective unconscious, and mythology, and all these other transformational</p>
<p>kind of consciousness views. But he tended to hide his</p>
<p>belief in reincarnation. You know, he came to it kind of late</p>
<p>in life, and he began to hide it because he had pushed the boundaries so much</p>
<p>he was concerned about the backlash. But it's there in his work. And I think that's what</p>
<p>happens with a lot of people. I think they go 'Well, I'm not sure I want to go into that area'</p>
<p>because it's got a stigma attached to it. And it really has, hasn't it? Because the moment you say the word reincarnation,</p>
<p>you've got like a-- there's a whole kind of battery of sceptics coming at you.</p>
<p>Whether they're coming from Christianity or whether they're coming from, you know,</p>
<p>materialist science. You know, it's like you really put your</p>
<p>head above the parapet. For years, for decades, I was taking students into the</p>
<p>literature on reincarnation. And it's like you just-- once you put all that aside and you just look at the cases,</p>
<p>you just look the evidence. I mean, I found 95 percent of my students were able to overcome all kinds</p>
<p>of resistances, both secular and religious resistance, because they're trained</p>
<p>in our culture to follow the evidence. Once they saw the evidence and how</p>
<p>consistent it was, and how it appeared in so many contexts,</p>
<p>spontaneous memories, evoked memories. Theyjust-- they accepted it. Once they accepted it, it was a life</p>
<p>-changing event in many of their lives. Do you have any favourite stories that you remember of those recurrences,</p>
<p>because it's not-- I have so many. The one I opened the book with 'Life</p>
<p>Cycles', the one I start in the opening pages, is a case of a young</p>
<p>girl named Romy Crees. And Romy was born</p>
<p>to Catholic parents in Iowa. So it's like, it's okay if they</p>
<p>want to reincarnate in India. That's their business. But everybody knows Iowan Catholics</p>
<p>do not reincarnate. But she had spontaneous memories of having been a man, Joe Williams,</p>
<p>in a previous life. She remembers being married. She remembers three children,</p>
<p>having three children, their names. She remembered dying in a motorcycle accident, and she had</p>
<p>a phobia of motorcycles. And long story short, researchers got</p>
<p>to her eventually and brought her to the town where she had remembered</p>
<p>living as Joe Williams. And she was able to remember--</p>
<p>identify the mother of Joe Williams. She insisted that they pick up blue</p>
<p>flowers on the way to the house because she said, Those are the flowers that she</p>
<p>likes, and that turned out to be true. She was able to identify from pictures who the people were in Joe Williams's</p>
<p>life, the players of their life. And she developed a deep emotional bond</p>
<p>to Williams's mother, who was alive. And his wife named Sheila. He had been married. She had been married to-- Joe</p>
<p>had been married to Sheila. They were--did have three children. Sheila and Joe were killed</p>
<p>in a motorcycle accident. So this has-- goes on, and on, and</p>
<p>on. I've read hundreds of these cases. And there's so many of them, yeah. So many. These children remember very</p>
<p>intimate details of family history. They remember-- they know the architecture</p>
<p>inside homes that they've never been in. They can walk around a town that they've never been in and they</p>
<p>know their way around. They remember the personalities</p>
<p>from the previous person's life. And they remember arguments</p>
<p>that they had with neighbours, incidents that came up in-- Like the time</p>
<p>a child, when they were having a birthday party for their child - that a neighbour's</p>
<p>dog bit one of the children in the party. Very, very-- things that are</p>
<p>-- just don't make the public news. Little details.</p>
<p>It's the little details, isn't it? There's one I've read that I loved. I can't remember exactly. But I remember a reincarnated</p>
<p>memory of-- in a Muslim family. And they took the little girl, I think it</p>
<p>was a little girl, into the family. And the women were the veiled,</p>
<p>completely veiled. And she identified from looking at them,</p>
<p>from seeing their body language, without seeing their faces or</p>
<p>anything, she could name them. And that was like, wow,</p>
<p>that's how deep this kind of detail goes. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah it's fun to explore those things. And I-- you know,</p>
<p>I recommend to people that you just take a look at some of the evidence,</p>
<p>because it's very-- I find it very affirming. You know, sort of like, it's</p>
<p>difficult to refute that level of detail. And I don't know, you can come up with-- I'm sure a good cynic can</p>
<p>come up with all kinds of-- Well, here's one for the cynics. This is one of Ian Stevenson's cases. They brought this boy back into the life</p>
<p>circumstances of the previous personality. And the wife of the previous personality</p>
<p>said, 'Okay, if you're my husband, where did you put the will? After you</p>
<p>died, we looked all over for the will. We couldn't find it.' The little boy walks over to a floorboard in the kitchen,</p>
<p>picks up a board, reaches down and underneath</p>
<p>the floor and pulls up the will. Isn't that something? How many of those cases do you read before you begin to understand,</p>
<p>this is just happening. It's just part of the rhythm of life.</p>
<p>Totally. It is extraordinary. And also it has-- there's a whole load of documentation about marks on the body,</p>
<p>isn't there? You know people that have marks on the body</p>
<p>that relate to previous events. Or you know-- I don't think we need to go down that route, but it's another whole</p>
<p>area of documentation. That was Ian Stevenson's last work. And if you do want to go down that area,</p>
<p>you can read his two volume, thousand page book</p>
<p>on reincarnation and biology, which he studies 187 cases</p>
<p>with medical documentation. Really rigorous, isn't it?</p>
<p>Rigorous, very, very rigorous. And what we find is that the death wounds, the wounds associated with death</p>
<p>in the previous personality show up as birthmarks or scars</p>
<p>in the subsequent personality. But this is suggesting not only do our -- does our mind influence subsequent</p>
<p>mind, but even our body, our mind's experience in the body can</p>
<p>influence the formation of tissue in our subsequent body. And that of</p>
<p>course just deepens the story. Absolutely.</p>
<p>And that's why I wanted to bring it up, because that's what leads</p>
<p>into the therapeutic work, doesn't it? Because, if you open to this idea then-- I mean I'm just thinking of all the people</p>
<p>out there who have difficulties, maybe in their health,</p>
<p>or maybe in their relationships, or maybe addictions,</p>
<p>or you know whatever we're facing in life, or just things that they've-- complexes</p>
<p>that they find really hard to overcome. And if we understand that those things may have a root in a previous lifetime</p>
<p>and that was something unfinished or incomplete, then it can open up</p>
<p>a whole therapeutic journey for us. And that's what this whole therapeutic</p>
<p>community has evolved, out of this. The past life therapy community, basically, there are any number</p>
<p>of therapists who've said something to the effect of this:</p>
<p>If you put someone into a relaxed, inward-focused state,</p>
<p>a hypnotic state but people have a lot of misunderstandings of what hypnosis--</p>
<p>but just relaxed inward-focused state, and you invite them to go to the source</p>
<p>of the problem that your-- they've come to therapy to address,</p>
<p>about 35-40 percent of them will go back to something in their present life. It'll</p>
<p>come back to something that happened in their childhood or</p>
<p>something in their infancy. But a significant 50-60 percent of people will go back to something that's</p>
<p>rooted in a previous lifetime. And when they consciously remember that previous</p>
<p>lifetime, and they consciously re-appropriate the trauma that they</p>
<p>weren't able to fully internalise and address in that lifetime,</p>
<p>particularly death could-- circumstances surrounding their death,</p>
<p>when they are able to consciously remember and assimilate it into their present</p>
<p>consciousness, then consistently, over and over again,</p>
<p>underlying psychological problems and even physical problems begin to loosen</p>
<p>their grip on us and untie the knots. So [inaudible] a greater depth. Because they have these roots deep in the</p>
<p>collective unconscious, you know, and we're going into the collective unconscious to find them</p>
<p>and pull them out. So that's-- Well, let's be a little careful here because</p>
<p>collective unconscious, in a Jungian kind of usage refers</p>
<p>to the unconscious of the entire species. So let's maybe call a soul consciousness, which is the collective unconscious</p>
<p>of the individual through time. I got a good question for you, which is, I have a really dear friend, and he is a</p>
<p>kind of startling intellect. He's in his late seventies now and really,</p>
<p>really intelligent, very spiritual man. And yet he has a difficulty</p>
<p>with reincarnation. And we have wonderful discussions around</p>
<p>it, in the past, and his kind of-- his very sophisticated spiritual</p>
<p>intellect, you know, where it goes is-- and I think others may</p>
<p>come from this direction as well, that's why I'm saying it, is that,</p>
<p>you know, you really want, you know, you want to believe it. Everyone wants to believe</p>
<p>in the continuity of our existence. And yet the great Advaita teachers or whatever, they would talk about the surrender</p>
<p>of the individual ego into the higher-- you know into the-- back</p>
<p>into the ocean of being. And that's something that you have</p>
<p>to undergo in order to attain liberation. And so there is this very strong spiritual kind of-- I think we've referred</p>
<p>to it as 'up and out' kind of cosmology,</p>
<p>where you know there-- we are here to escape this, this cycle,</p>
<p>this samsaric cycle. And that-- you know, so that we</p>
<p>can attain this liberation. And we attain it within this lifetime, in a body, or we may attain it,</p>
<p>you know, afterwards. So that's another whole</p>
<p>kind of interesting area there, isn't it? Yeah, simply because there are cultures</p>
<p>who have believed in reincarnation for thousands of years, and have developed</p>
<p>a certain understanding of it in their culture, doesn't mean</p>
<p>that they've got it right. And I think that reincarnation is one of those ideas that</p>
<p>simply, once we begin to see the evidence, then it begins to deepen a line of enquiry.</p>
<p>Which I-- for me personally, I think is-- I've revised dramatically</p>
<p>the understanding I had of reincarnation borrowed from Eastern traditions,</p>
<p>Eastern cultures. And one of the traditions has to do with this larger question:</p>
<p>Where does reincarnation go? Where is it taking us? What's the endgame of reincarnation? And you're right. All the cultures, all the religions of the Axial age - it</p>
<p>came into existence three to 5000 years ago - all of them teach of a cosmological</p>
<p>journey that's an up-and-out cosmology. So there is a sense</p>
<p>that we're trapped here. This is not as good as spiritual reality. We want to develop either in one lifetime, if it's a Christian salvation,</p>
<p>salvation by grace, you know, or multiple lifetimes to achieve</p>
<p>samsara-- excuse me, acheive moksha. Which is escape from samsara,</p>
<p>escape from the physical world. We achieve some type of enlightenment condition, which is the passport that</p>
<p>allows us to leave and not come back. And all of these traditions are</p>
<p>basically about escape. And that leaves unanswered the fundamental question - what is the purpose</p>
<p>of physical existence in the first place? And now that we have a deeper understanding of how many billions</p>
<p>of years of genius have gone into the manifestation of the physical</p>
<p>world - it's not a very satisfactory conclusion to think that just within five-- we only became conscious of these</p>
<p>deeper dimensions about 5000 years ago. As soon as we become self-conscious</p>
<p>of the level of consciousness which we share with all other</p>
<p>beings and all existence. As soon as we become aware of that and can</p>
<p>live our life from that centre, then the purpose of existence is</p>
<p>to escape the entire physical world? And I don't think that's really true. And it's a little bit rooted in</p>
<p>that kind of slightly self-denial philosophy, isn't it? That, you know,</p>
<p>that also is many thousands of years old. Yeah. I think that basically all the Axial religions got two things</p>
<p>fundamentally wrong. They've got many things right,</p>
<p>but they got two things wrong. They got nature wrong. They don't really have an adequate</p>
<p>theology or understanding of nature. And they got women wrong. And the two are connected because</p>
<p>women are closely connected to nature. And they're patriarchally-oriented</p>
<p>and they're escapist-oriented. And I think it makes-- as</p>
<p>an historian, I understand it. I think about four or 5000 years ago, through various psycho-technologies:</p>
<p>either yoga, or meditation, or psychedelic substances,</p>
<p>we began to have a deeper experience of the mother universe, of this universe</p>
<p>that surrounds the physical universe. Once you have experiential contact with that universe, it is so blissful, it</p>
<p>is so ecstatic-soaked that you cannot help-- and you recognise</p>
<p>that that's where we're from. You cannot help believe</p>
<p>that that's where we belong. This is not where we belong,</p>
<p>that's where we belong. And they develop a theology of return. So the Saviour comes to take us home. The enlightened being comes</p>
<p>to liberate us back into our home. But that still leaves the question,</p>
<p>what is the purpose of creation? And I think what we're beginning</p>
<p>to understand now, as our experience of this mother universe</p>
<p>is deepened over time, and our understanding of the physical</p>
<p>universe has deepened over time, is that we're not here to achieve</p>
<p>escape velocity and leave. We're here to incarnate more, and more, and more of spiritual reality and capacity</p>
<p>inside our physical being, so that we can truly live and create heaven</p>
<p>on Earth, to wake up and stay. And not just to wake up as an individual, but to wake up as an entire</p>
<p>species and stay. Now that-- you can't leave that. I mean we're going to discuss</p>
<p>that more aren't we. We're going to come back to that, yeah. But that's a huge window to open up. It's this-- you know, and you've</p>
<p>touched on a lot of themes there, particularly,</p>
<p>you know, the thing about the feminine, the physical body. You know, that's what I think I interpret partly what you're saying as well is</p>
<p>that those religions didn't really understand the physical body,</p>
<p>as you said, nature. Didn't value it. Because there's vast beauty</p>
<p>in this physicality. And it's perhaps-- what we're exploring</p>
<p>is perhaps it's here to be spiritualised. Perhaps it's here-- you know perhaps that's why we're here,</p>
<p>to bring that ecstatic realisation, deeper, and deeper, and</p>
<p>deeper into the form. Because, you know, if we see that that's our highest purpose,</p>
<p>we no longer want to leave. That's-- then our role is,</p>
<p>through subsequent incarnations, to bring more and more</p>
<p>of that light down into the Earth. And then we're also taking full</p>
<p>responsibility for the body and the Earth. You know which is something</p>
<p>we also haven't done very well. Yeah, absolutely. And if that first-- sounds at first disappointing, where we would say, 'Oh,</p>
<p>no, I want heaven, please. Thank you very much. I don't want, you know, a</p>
<p>transformed body here. Because here is still too difficult.' I think</p>
<p>we may be underestimating how-- but we may be underestimating what is</p>
<p>possible. And just what it would really feel like to live a truly fully</p>
<p>-spiritualised, enlightened existence. And here I think we can look at some</p>
<p>of the God-soaked masters of history. Who are truly living in the</p>
<p>God-soaked condition, or the, you know, a primordial condition</p>
<p>that is radically open to the vast mind of the universe, inside their body,</p>
<p>inside time and space. And what we're seeing from these Mahasiddhas, these great beings, is that</p>
<p>they can do what we would call miracles. Because there is so much spiritual power</p>
<p>concentrated in their presence, that the-- it is as if the laws of</p>
<p>nature operate differently around them. And they're showing us a prototype of what</p>
<p>each of us is in the process of becoming. And, therefore, if we imagine what it</p>
<p>would be like to have an entire species kind of living in that kind</p>
<p>of presence then, what a planet! Yeah and our physics is also pushing</p>
<p>us in that direction, isn't it? To the understandings that we are</p>
<p>entangled with nature, with the universe. And that-- and my old teachings is</p>
<p>based on this notion that in our DNA are contained these sleeping, dormant codes,</p>
<p>these Siddhis, as I call them, 64 Siddhis. And like you were you're</p>
<p>talking about, they're an activation inside us that is waiting for its moment so that we can</p>
<p>enter more fully into the next phase of our evolution, of the magical</p>
<p>universe, the quantum universe. You know, where our thoughts and our</p>
<p>feelings and our sensations are actually travelling kind of outside</p>
<p>our physical body. You know, they're entangled with nature. So nature then responds with us, to us, which perhaps it already does</p>
<p>at a level that we're not aware of. So it's just about opening up those</p>
<p>pathways, you know, those literal pathways in our being, into that next</p>
<p>phase of our evolution. We are already plugged into nature, very,</p>
<p>very deep levels down to the quantum level in the unified field. We're plugged</p>
<p>into our ecosystems and the subtle, intimate feedback. We're plugged into each</p>
<p>other, our minds wash back and forth. We're already there. But when we can become conscious of those</p>
<p>connections, when we can sort of lift off the obstructive shadows</p>
<p>that are carry-overs from other, sadder times,</p>
<p>then that connection becomes -- begins to rise, and it empowers</p>
<p>a conscious participation. And it makes what was</p>
<p>unconscious, conscious. And then existence becomes more enlivened,</p>
<p>I think, and enlivened with the synchronicities</p>
<p>that sort of indicate the broader intelligence that's a-- you know,</p>
<p>that's alive in life around us. Yeah. Yeah I'm sure that you know-- I'd love it if we could bring our conversation also</p>
<p>into sort of-- into people's lives a little bit, so that they can consider</p>
<p>their relationships and-- you know from this perspective, and how that might</p>
<p>change one's attitudes or views towards difficult relationships,</p>
<p>or towards, you know, what's the afflictions that come up in us</p>
<p>and that we have to handle in our everyday life. It really changes</p>
<p>all of that, doesn't it? Because then you look at life and it's actually a process of the opening</p>
<p>of the heart, which the teachers have always said. It's like every relationship,</p>
<p>it's purpose is to show us some grace. And I call this, this Law of Unseen Grace. You know, where every relationship that</p>
<p>shows up is offering us some-- you know particularly the difficult ones, is offering us some</p>
<p>incredible teaching, some virtue that we haven't yet polished. Whether it's forgiveness, or whether it's some, you know, clarity,</p>
<p>or whether it's-- you know, whatever it is, it's just some form of love</p>
<p>that we are here to learn from those relationships, because they have--</p>
<p>they come as part of our teaching-karma. You know, I always see it like, the</p>
<p>ancients called it-- this life a Lila. And I always see these-- a game,</p>
<p>a drama or a theatre. And, it's almost like, before you come in, you're given this little envelope,</p>
<p>and in there, you open up the envelope and in there is like,</p>
<p>'Okay, here's your script and here are-- ' and there's going</p>
<p>to be some things that show up. And these are the things you're going to learn this-- you know, you've</p>
<p>chosen it at some level. And so that changes the way that we</p>
<p>kind of see it-- behave, doesn't it? Yeah.</p>
<p>I think so. I'm sure if you had personal experience of that in your life, in your</p>
<p>emotional life, I mean that's-- Yeah.</p>
<p>And one little-- one more step. It's not simply the envelope</p>
<p>that was given you. But you were given three envelopes and you chose the one</p>
<p>that you felt was most suited for your evolution at this particular</p>
<p>point in history. And so it's your choice</p>
<p>to engage these challenges. And yeah-- and when we engage our life in that way,</p>
<p>it's taking full responsibility for the circumstances</p>
<p>in which we find ourselves in. It allows us to engage the challenges</p>
<p>with more patience, and with more dedication,</p>
<p>and with more of the long term. Because we know we're not-- if this is something that if we don't deal with it</p>
<p>now, it's not going to go away. It's just going to come</p>
<p>back in another form. So let's get it done now. Let's deal with it now. And it also allows you to build on things, because I think</p>
<p>our understanding of reincarnation is being very informed by the therapists</p>
<p>working heroically in past-life therapy. But if you only pay attention to those cases, it can tend to create</p>
<p>an understanding of reincarnation that is tilted towards failures</p>
<p>coming forward that we-- Traumas. Traumas, yeah. But just like the school system around us</p>
<p>has many faults, but most of the kids learn and most</p>
<p>of the kids pass every year. And I think most people rise to the karma,</p>
<p>the challenge of their life. And that means every lifetime we're not simply dealing with leftover</p>
<p>issues from the past. We're building on assets, we're spending assets, and investing in greater</p>
<p>fruition in the future. And so it helps us handle</p>
<p>the challenging circumstances. But it also helps us embrace the positive circumstances of our life,</p>
<p>the hidden talent which comes forward unannounced, the partnership which emerges</p>
<p>that we can feel such a deep kinship with this person, that we can go</p>
<p>forward and do something new with. Yeah. And you kind of triggered a memory of mine</p>
<p>about-- from Sri Aurobindo, you know, who spoke incredibly clearly</p>
<p>with his penetrating mind about the complexity of karma,</p>
<p>and how we-- you know, because we probably need to sort of probably discuss</p>
<p>karma a little bit, and how we misunderstand it so easily</p>
<p>by trying to oversimplify it. And, actually, when you look at the universe with all its</p>
<p>multiple dimensions and the quantum field, and there's these force fields</p>
<p>operating at different levels. But there's this karmic force that's equalising and balancing, or</p>
<p>that has a tendency towards balance, we could say, and it's-- and allowing us</p>
<p>to go through this educational process. But everything at different levels is influenced by these strands</p>
<p>of the karmic force. And that karmic force seems to have-- it's like the idea I said about unseen grace,</p>
<p>if you are able to fully embrace it in your life, then you get a grace</p>
<p>through going-- through unwrapping it. But you've got to kind of have the courage face it fully, and really take it</p>
<p>in and let it-- you know, whatever the suffering is,</p>
<p>transform it, transmute it. So it doesn't-- transmutation of karma play a huge part in this</p>
<p>reincarnative theology. If we just look around us. It's the web of cause and effect. Everything is cause and effect. We live in a continuous web of cause and effect. The air we breathe,</p>
<p>the weather patterns, our biology, what we ate, the purity of what we ate,</p>
<p>everything is this flow of cause and effect, the universe, the movement</p>
<p>of the planets, the solar system. We live in a continuous web of cause and effect. And</p>
<p>here we're simply focusing on that portion of the web of cause and effect,</p>
<p>which influences the human-- the development of the soul,</p>
<p>influences our human psychophysical development, which is a subset</p>
<p>of this much larger cause and effect. And, in that context, I think we've had a tendency, I think, to</p>
<p>narrow our discussion of Karma. Usually, many of the teachers will talk about karma, and they're only talking</p>
<p>about that portion of the karma, which immediately impinges upon our</p>
<p>spiritual maturity. Where they were making progress, becoming a more</p>
<p>spiritually mature person. But a lot of karma, probably the bulk of</p>
<p>karma, is just amoral cause and effect. You have a habit, you practise something, it becomes a skill, that skill</p>
<p>carries over into another life. You have an automobile accident,</p>
<p>you develop a trauma of a particular circumstance, that carries</p>
<p>over into another life. It's not necessarily</p>
<p>about your spiritual development. It's just cause and effect. Yeah, circumstantial.</p>
<p>Yeah. And so when-- as you open up to the conditioning,</p>
<p>that's kind of etching itself in your life, and you lift it out,</p>
<p>engage it, lift it out. Then that-- the well-spring</p>
<p>of your life becomes freer. It becomes clearer. And you're not stepping out of the web of cause and effect,</p>
<p>but you're stepping into a greater freedom within the web-work of cause</p>
<p>and effect that surrounds you. You have greater capacity to make</p>
<p>increasingly free choices. Greater capacity to choose. Ask yourself, 'Well, what do I want? What would I like to have?'</p>
<p>Instead of a compulsion of, you know, grabbing. You know, it's tempting, isn't it? For some people to kind of say,</p>
<p>'Well, karma and reincarnation,' then there's this sort of like, 'Well,</p>
<p>that person over there was born disabled. Does that mean they've done something</p>
<p>terrible in their last life?' And there's that whole</p>
<p>real sort of oversimplification-- Over, yeah.</p>
<p>Of a very complex kind of arena where -- you know, we don't-- unless you can</p>
<p>plug right into the soul-quality inside that person, inside that being,</p>
<p>you don't really know what-- you know, they could be that hidden</p>
<p>Saint that has deliberately taken on that incredibly challenging role,</p>
<p>to polish one particular virtue, you know, or skill, over the period of one lifetime. And equally I guess, like,</p>
<p>very short incarnations. That's-- I don't think you and I talked</p>
<p>about those, but I'd love to hear what you -- you know, like a child that comes</p>
<p>in for a very short time and then leaves. That also has implications for</p>
<p>the healing of the whole, doesn't it? Because why does a child come in for a short time,</p>
<p>or a baby is born very-- for a very short period of time and then</p>
<p>there's-- leaves this grief behind it. But then there's this feeling that it's</p>
<p>also still part of your life. Yeah. Let's explore that, I mean we haven't-- we</p>
<p>can go and-- We haven't talked about that, yeah. You know it's a-- we can recognise</p>
<p>the principle of cause and effect. We can recognise the principle</p>
<p>of karma-vipaka, cause and effect. But then we can get-- so many</p>
<p>teachers I think sometimes get -- or all of us, we think we</p>
<p>can determine cause and effect. We think we can understand it when really we're just touching the wrapping</p>
<p>on the package. We're just really touching the surface,</p>
<p>and the safest position I think really is recognise that we're looking</p>
<p>at a deep, deep mystery here. And you're-- it would be foolish to try to judge anybody's karma that's</p>
<p>just a-- that's a wasted exercise. Better to stick with the karma that you</p>
<p>can penetrate within your own life. And you're right, because we don't know,</p>
<p>we really don't know what's happening when we see cause and effect</p>
<p>operating around us. When you-- I would tell my students, when you see great suffering,</p>
<p>you're either seeing a sinner or a Saint. And you can never know which it is,</p>
<p>so best not to make any judgments at all. And I think there are many hidden Saints, many more hidden Saints who are</p>
<p>taking on a lot of cause and effect, either from their own larger soul stream,</p>
<p>or from even a collective soul stream. So they're actually focusing in their body, in their psyche,</p>
<p>what we might call negative karma, negative cause and effect,</p>
<p>for the uplift of the whole. And that type of generosity</p>
<p>and compassion, we see it around us all the time in good parents,</p>
<p>and good mothers, and good fathers. They would be-- do anything</p>
<p>for their children. And I think souls</p>
<p>at that deeper level do that too. So we can't judge. We really just</p>
<p>couldn't judge, it's a waste of effort. No. I read this book. I think I told you about this book, and anyone-- it's a recommendation called</p>
<p>'Sand Talk', and it's by an Aboriginal from Australia, or part</p>
<p>-Aboriginal, and really intelligent man. And he tells the story of when he went to talk to one of the elders about,</p>
<p>you know, the problems of, you know, the indigenous people,</p>
<p>particularly the men who had kind of just got-- gone down the role</p>
<p>of alcoholic, the way of alcoholism. And were eating really terrible food, and, like, were overweight and obese,</p>
<p>and these terrible problems. And he was, like, really concerned about them, and the old elder just said,</p>
<p>'Yeah, they're the warriors. You know, they are taking on the karmic,</p>
<p>you know they are warrior spirits in our tribe, in our lineage. And they're holding</p>
<p>this kind of negativity in their bodies. And one day they will become-- they will move</p>
<p>from warrior to healer. And that's the path. That's the kind of evolutionary pathway.' But it was a beautiful,</p>
<p>it really, like, it really stuck with this young man as he was</p>
<p>exploring like, 'Wow,' that's a really kind of powerful, empowering</p>
<p>way to see someone dealing with, like, a cultural problem. You know or a societal,</p>
<p>you know, difficulty that's more collective,</p>
<p>you know, that we see a lot. You know, collective</p>
<p>karma is a-- you know, we're touching on here as well. Yeah, it's a very, very deep-- those deep</p>
<p>currents that run underneath, that requires us to open to a much deeper,</p>
<p>expanded spiritual story. And because we often think of reincarnation</p>
<p>and karma in a very individualistic, atomistic fashion where we're-- you know,</p>
<p>the individual soul is evolving themselves over the skilful use of choice</p>
<p>in the context of karma. And if we start to sink into a larger</p>
<p>understanding, a deeper understanding, then we recognise that each individual</p>
<p>is a fractal point within a unified field. And that there's a-- these deep currents</p>
<p>that are running within the unconscious of humanity, or the</p>
<p>soul-field of humanity, and that we are all players</p>
<p>on a larger evolutionary dynamic. Then it just opens up a deeper</p>
<p>understanding of what's taking place here. And I know that we've sort of tagged this for one of our topics for our</p>
<p>second discussion, but it's-- yeah. Well we'll plant the seed now. When you go into that kind of world view,</p>
<p>the perfection of the choreography of what you're explaining is just</p>
<p>mind blowing, isn't it? It's mind blowing in terms</p>
<p>of the interconnectivity of soul groups, and these fractals,</p>
<p>and these patternings of humans. And this is why one of the great insights</p>
<p>that I got from your uni-- 'Mind of the Universe' book,</p>
<p>because you describe this really well. It's a paradox, I think. And maybe it's one of the last things we can just discuss here today because it's</p>
<p>so important, I find, and it's the paradox of being an individual soul and yet</p>
<p>being everything at the same time. So how does that paradox-- how</p>
<p>do we-- how does that hold up? You described it beautifully</p>
<p>in your book as, I think you said, 'the soul was open on all sides'. I think that was the expression you used,</p>
<p>which I really liked, open on all sides. It's so, like, part of the ocean</p>
<p>and yet still a focalised drop. 'Time and awareness', also, you named it. Yeah it seems common-sensical that you can't be both apart</p>
<p>and the whole at the same time. Those are mutual, exclusive categories. And even, you know, great spiritual</p>
<p>teachers - the Vedantic tradition in Hinduism and other spiritual systems</p>
<p>have said, 'The goal of life is to abandon your individuality</p>
<ul>
<li>dissolve that and allow yourself to be absorbed into the totality</li>
</ul>
<p>and know the bliss of absorption.' So that means all the individual</p>
<p>capacity which we are developing over all these incarnations in this</p>
<p>view ends in extinction. And it's kind of wasted. And I think it's wasted. And I think that's-- it's</p>
<p>an inadequate world view. And what has emerged in my spiritual path</p>
<p>and in my psychedelic path is a very different kind of world view,</p>
<p>that I think we share. And that is that we are moving into higher and higher,</p>
<p>more sophisticated forms of individuality. That individuality is one</p>
<p>of the great gift of creation. It's something that the divine</p>
<p>wants to encourage in its creation. And-- but at early stages of individuality, we experience our individuality cut off</p>
<p>from the larger texture of surrounds. So it's us against them,</p>
<p>or us and the whole. But when individuality matures into a richer expression,</p>
<p>into what I would call the birth of the diamond soul,</p>
<p>then there is both a sense of being a specific defined individuality emerging</p>
<p>out of the specific historical lineage. And yet at the same time, profoundly open</p>
<p>to the larger patterns of existence, open to each other and compassionate</p>
<p>heart, open to other human beings with whom we have such deep</p>
<p>histories with, and open to-- in a sense that the intelligence</p>
<p>of the universe, open to the perceptions and the influence</p>
<p>of ideas that flow into us. And this communion with the universe. Which-- and I actually believe</p>
<p>that you have to have developed a very, very strong individuality to withstand</p>
<p>the intensity of the communion that's available to us when we enter into</p>
<p>communion with the one, with the whole. It is as if, if we didn't-- if we weren't really, really diamond hard and focused and clear,</p>
<p>when we encountered the love of the universe for us,</p>
<p>it would just shatter us. We have to be strong in order to actually participate in the deeper</p>
<p>levels of communion. And I think you know that-- that's such</p>
<p>an empowering vision, so empowering. And it's also a-- you know, I think it opens this</p>
<p>question of our notion of enlightenment, our notion of divinity,</p>
<p>we have to kind of go on expanding that, because it's just</p>
<p>a notion that we've inherited. And even though it's been useful to get us to where we are,</p>
<p>we have to just go on expanding it. And, for me, what</p>
<p>is kind of missing more in the current, you know, modalities is creativity. That whole idea of it coming to an end and then going out into the wonderful</p>
<p>absorption of the whole, you know, by maintaining the individuality at the same time, what you are maintaining</p>
<p>is creativity, creativity itself. Because then you are like a shard</p>
<p>of the divine creative essence. And it's like you said in your book,</p>
<p>'Go out and create my children.' You know, and if there were</p>
<p>a divinity, let's just say, and it wanted to have children, then the thing it would want for its</p>
<p>children is to be free, right? And to go out and create,</p>
<p>and to become gods within God. That's the vision I hold, that we become</p>
<p>creator gods within the wider God. Yes. Lovely expression!</p>
<p>You know, small 'g' in a big 'G'. Gods within God, yeah. The creative spark</p>
<p>within the fire of creation. Yes. I agree with that.</p>
<p>I share that. And it changes everything. It changes how we greet the children who are born into our families, because</p>
<p>we know that they're not coming from us. They're coming to us. It changes how we see old people and how</p>
<p>we see little people, because young people are not necessarily</p>
<p>young in terms of their soul-age. Old people are not necessarily</p>
<p>old in terms of their soul-age. It just opens up a much larger tapestry, and it gives us</p>
<p>permission to recognise the deep aspirations that we have towards</p>
<p>greatness, towards great creativity, towards the great love,</p>
<p>towards great spiritual fulfilment. Things that we may or may not finish</p>
<p>and get through in this lifetime. But we can move toward them. It's much more, in some respect, sophisticated spirituality,</p>
<p>isn't it? It's more nuanced. It requires a subtler</p>
<p>kind of understanding intellectually - I would say intellectually but through a</p>
<p>subtler intelligence to understand it. It's not this sort of, you know,</p>
<p>here's a law of karma. It governs everything. You know, bang! It's not that simple. It's like Aurobindo says, 'There are layers and layers</p>
<p>of understanding and subtlety and nuance.' It's like a-- I'm a lover of tea,</p>
<p>you know, fine tea. And when you find something like that, and you can be anything, you can be</p>
<p>a chess player, and you find the subtlest nuances in the thing you're</p>
<p>really understanding. The layers, and layers, and layers</p>
<p>as you become more attuned to it. And I think that's what we are. We are becoming more, and more tuned, the more evolved that individual soul-essence</p>
<p>becomes. Then the more subtle we can-- the more we can</p>
<p>understand, you know, these nuances. And then we're kind of-- I don't know</p>
<p>-- that we're really inspired by the-- empowered, as well,</p>
<p>by the creative current. I mean, maybe we can leave this to the next one,</p>
<p>but people always talk about past lives. And my part of my teaching is like,</p>
<p>I'm interested in future-lives as well. And because when you expand your sense of time broadly enough, you know, really,</p>
<p>like, really don't hold back anything. You don't need to just look backwards. You can also remember forwards, because there's this feeling of memory</p>
<p>has to go back. But memory, also, for me,</p>
<p>is like, it travels forwards. And that's what we call revelation. So revelations can come backwards and</p>
<p>forwards through time into this essence. And this essence can be hugely expanded by those revelations,</p>
<p>and more focused than ever in the present, you know,</p>
<p>in the beauty of the present moment. So, yeah, I think that's</p>
<p>the thought I'd like to end on. But is there any, like-- do you</p>
<p>want to close this off? That's a really good thought</p>
<p>and a good spot to end on. To me, the principle of accumulation is one of the fundamental principles I bring</p>
<p>to understanding what's happening in creation,</p>
<p>that the universe is accumulating. It's learning. It's a self-learning system. And so we are constantly learning. We can't help but learn. Even if we do a mediocre job in our lifetime, we're still</p>
<p>learning in that lifetime. And if we do a better job, we're learning. And as we learn, we activate. In one sense, I think we are learning</p>
<p>to be geniuses in every area of life. A genius at chess, a genius at relationships, a genius</p>
<p>in all the different areas of life. And it's as if each lifetime is a petal</p>
<p>in a flower, the soul is the flower. And their-- if you just-- I meditate sometimes on a flower</p>
<p>and imagine each hundred-year-lifetime is a pistil, and a stamen,</p>
<p>and a petal in this magnificent flower. And that's, you know-- to</p>
<p>be a genius at life, to really to be completely unfolded, and</p>
<p>taking advantage of the opportunity that we've been given to grow</p>
<p>and become more than we've been. And, again,</p>
<p>so many-- even though many cultures have understood reincarnation, I</p>
<p>don't think they've grasped it fully. They haven't really seen the</p>
<p>full potential of the concept. They've really seen it within an early</p>
<p>limitation of it. And on the future,</p>
<p>we're going to talk about time more, I know, as we go on, but let me</p>
<p>just leave with the thought that Robert Monroe, the great out-of-body</p>
<p>researcher and the founder of the Monroe Institute</p>
<p>of Applied Sciences, his book 'Far Journeys' / 'Ultimate</p>
<p>Journey', he said he reached a point in his explorations out-of-body,</p>
<p>where he discovered he realised that you don't necessarily have to incarnate</p>
<p>in the next century. That incarnation isn't</p>
<p>necessarily historically linear. You could have former lives that were</p>
<p>actually lived in future time. So that, isn't that-- that just,</p>
<p>like, 'Oh man,' that really-- I'm going to have to unpick</p>
<p>that one a little bit. Yeah, that really challenges things. In addition to intuiting the future which is not yet,</p>
<p>and bringing the not yet into the now, I wonder sometimes whether some of us have sampled that future time, and are</p>
<p>inculcating the awareness in the now. That's what I would call a current</p>
<p>of involution as opposed to evolution. There is a spiritual force coming down, and there is</p>
<p>an evolution-- evolving force going up, if you want to do it up and down,</p>
<p>but, you know, it's like a funnel. Yeah,</p>
<p>Sri Aurobindo. I love you quoting Sri Aurobindo because he's one of my heroes</p>
<p>too, and he says all that clearly. And I agree.</p>
<p>Yeah. Great.</p>
<p>Well, what a wonderful beginning Chris. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Yeah, I look forward to where we go next. Yeah, me too, yeah. Take care. Take care Richard.</p></body></html>

      <p>author and psychedelic exploit Chris Bosch once again see documented the insights from 73 high dose LSD sessions conducted over the course of 20 years during upon his training as a philosopher of religion and following protocols established by stanislav grof chris went on a life-changing journey to explore his mind what he discovered drew mminton deep communion with cosmic consciousness Chris Bosh is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and religious studies a Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years chris is also adjunct faculty at California Institute of integral studies and a fellow at the Institute of noetic Sciences an award-winning teacher Chris work Chris's work explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness especially psychedelic states chris has written four books life's cycles a study of reincarnation and light of contemporary consciousness research dark night early dawn a pioneering work and cyclic philosophy and collective consciousness and the living classroom an exploration of teaching and collective fields of consciousness in his new book LSD and the mind of the universe which I must say is absolutely brilliant and seems to be getting really good reception with everyone I know that's that's reading it it is a dream poem of as you said the the deeper states that LSD gives us access to it was a quite an adventure of quite a long and interesting journey how long did it take you to write because there's obviously years of nights and well yeah I had years of notes and all the in the 20 years that I did the work and then I digested that material for more years and then I I condensed my sessions took notes and condensed them and got prepared and once I actually started writing it took five years okay this was a long project I think it really highlights the importance of some type of integration you being a writer obviously that's your modality of integration others it's our fathers it's music but yeah it really highlights the importance of finding a way of making sense of these experiences after the facts and I remember you know reading in the book that you would take the time to write as soon as possible after such an experience and to use the music that you had played during the sessions as a trigger as a mimetic device to or mmm-morning device yeah - yeah those emotions which can often get lost in the cloud of the intensity of this yeah let me just mention something about the method just give a context because that was an important aid in solving a problem the challenging with work doing the work the way that I did what I did was to work after three medium dos sessions always following Stan Grof protocol so I was always totally isolated always working with the sitter always working with eyeshades and a music totally internalized sessions after three preliminary sessions I did all the rest of the sessions seventy three sessions total high-dose sessions so I was working it essentially I aimed at 600 micrograms so between 500 and 600 micrograms so when you're working with dose is that high and you're going is deep in cereal sessions over many years Recall becomes a serious issue because you're just pushing the boundaries of consciousness so deeply so I found that to record the sessions it was important to record them within 24 hours and recording them often had be writing at the very edges of my comprehension because I was trying to describe experiences that were deeply mysterious to me at the time so I found it was a help if I listen to the music that was played in the session in exactly the order in which was played and I would play music over and over again while I was trying to record the session after the day after and then when I was done with that section I'd go on to the next piece of music all the way through well that really you know because the day after a session you're kind of hoarse around the edges but your verbal functions are back so you're in one foot in one foot out and I found by listening to the music I could get into a state where I called it's standing at the edge of the well where I could basically get back in the edge of it and enough that I could get it down on paper yeah it's still a Scylla liminal space yes I remember I remember writing that some of the things you've written down during the station that might have been like reality is which at the time can be so profound and meaningful and you read him begging you of course it is it's always yeah sifting through that stuff to give you things that can really be applied in general general I I didn't try to make notes or record anything during the session itself because I was so far removed that you know I just wasn't even in touch with my own body let alone with anything going on in the room interesting because instead something I'm thinking a bit about recently is recording stations in the moment particularly with by Vimeo DMZ and Toad medicine because people seem to be channeling stuff things are coming through languages and mm-hmm boys Asians that are quite simply out of this world mm-hmm there is almost no way of recollecting afterwards and so there does to be some merit and recording and the moments to carry out things that might come through when your vessel is empty and then maybe it may vary by substance and agenda the the quirks the tricky part about the five améo experience is how fast it is it's short and it's incredibly fast and the LSD experience is very very long it's it's an eight-hour window so it each of them hos distinct challenges for recall and integration as it is June a clickable across all all psychics and medicines I think they all have their own unique challenges the following graphs protocol once I guess the key equation to begin with is what made you decide to do such large doses given that thanks do you know what and it's part of going yeah well you know in stands early work he clearly differentiates between psycholytic or low dose therapy and psychedelic high dose therapy and the protocol for psychedelic therapy was they developed this in Spring Grove hospital and they were trying to trigger a near-death episode experience with patients who were terminally ill so and it was limited to three sessions I thought well if you could go into high-dose session space three times you could do it more times if you could do it safely three times you could do it safely multiple times and I guess in the beginning I did high-dose session simply because it was hard to find time to do sessions in a dual career marriage and soon there were children involved just together in both of our schedules to get a day where we could give the entire day over to this work and so I thought I was still thinking in terms of a personal model of therapeutic engagement so all the eastern sources that I had you know I'm professor of religious studies teachers from religion psychology of religion and these Eastern sources basically said your karma is ultimately finite over even with many lifetimes your karma is finite and I thought that I could just work through mine faster by working with high doses I knew the sessions would be hard but I thought if I could just stay grounded and stay focused and confronting the shadow I could just work through my shadow asked her that way eventually that that whole protocol was shattered when I began to realize that what was happening in my sessions went far beyond anything that concerned only my personal psyche and my personal karma my personal soul and then after that point sorry that when we at the point of the ocean of suffering that you experienced where yeah was what honestly had to read that that examines of the entire collective human pain throughout all of history yeah yeah it is hard to read I had to really give some careful thought of how much to expose that because I know it's challenging for readers to go into that material but just to finish out other topic even once I let go of that personal model I found that I developed I liked where the high dose work took me and it took me farther than I imagined and I developed a taste for it now I don't recommend this protocol I really don't I would do it differently if I were doing it over again today I would be much gentler on myself I would balance high dose work with low dose work I would violence LSD with psilocybin ayahuasca more organic psychedelics but at the time I mean this was really I started in 79 so I did this work between 79 and 99 when I was 30 to 50 years old so at the time well I just I ended up pushing myself harder than I would recommend other people to push themselves it's really not necessary I also miss the growth in the book too which is good now yeah yeah I thought that the goal was to get somewhere you know to get to some end point that would be enlightenment or oneness with God or the primal void and I came to realize that that was a naive expectation late I mean 50 sessions in I had experience which convinced me that the universe is infinite and the divine is infinite well it's not a matter of getting to the end or some ultimate state it's a matter of opening ourselves as deeply as we can to the intelligence of the universe or to the intelligence of the divine letting as much of it into us as possible and stabilizing it as deeply as possible so you would have known that at least on a theoretical level from Eastern studies that environments you know isn't the destination it's a journey Jada's at my sounds mm-hmm so you would have gone to into the stations with that at least and mind is a conceptual mm-hmm yeah but I found even even the Eastern models that I was familiar with and working with did not encapsulate or did not profile the full scale of the experiences that opened in this journey because I found that yes you can work through multiple layers of the bardo the inter the after death States you can go into extra samsaric reality into spiritual dimensions beyond the Bardo but whereas Buddhism particularly which is kind of the the Eastern traditions that I was most familiar with and most comfortable with even that tradition sort of stops at that point and says it invokes the grand silence you know when the Buddha was asked the ultimate questions he invoked the grand silence he wouldn't describe it and I found that there were realities that would open at that dimension that were just well Shoji on that grand silence is correlated with ineffability which is often thrown about and the psychedelic world particularly in relation to these large doses and writing the concept of ineffable in the boat yeah well as I say in the book I think ineffability is overrated yes it's a category I mean it really comes from William James in discussing discard one of the qualities of mystical experiences ineffability and I of course ultimately our rational mind and our verbal mind fall silence when confronting the infinite but I I work very very hard to put language to things and I believe in pushing language as far as humanly possible repeatedly before surrendering to the ineffable so because if we if we prioritize ineffability as one of the primary features of mystical experience it almost is this is as if we're saying the divine wants to be not known in my experience is that the divine wants to be known and so ineffability I think often is it's a symptom of hitting our experiential limits but if we it when we break into a new level of consciousness we can't bring all of it back there are gaps in my notes and we just can't bring it all back but I found that if you go back to that same level of consciousness again and again and again experiences that were undigestible or unrecognizable or ineffable in the beginning become comprehensible with repetition and with experience so to me and if you can't say where you went this is a little harsh but if you can't say where you went you probably just got lost and it reminds me of Makena is saying about bringing back a middle sized fish no you bring something back for the community you know yeah nothing in the realms of night extraordinary consciousness you need back something useful otherwise what's it for at least you can might go we get back in articulator and express it and particularly for me that's creative and even seem to have a real security about them that you can create something beautiful the painting or a sculpture that others can see appreciate that's one of the Satori gifts to be able to articulate this like daily experience and in creative man and writing certainly falls into that category yes yeah I found it just takes time I mean I've really had to sit with my experience for years and years to understand in fact it's a general rule of thumb I would never talk about an experience on until five years after I'd had it because it just takes a lot of time to fully digest and to understand in fact I had the narrative man had recorded my experiences all the way through but I was still learning things about the journey in the process of writing the entire journey down yeah when you start to write things down other things fall in it so I can create a space for those perhaps otherwise forgotten aspects to drop back in and there's even aspects of this Amazonian shamanic tradition that say you shouldn't speak like sharing circles are not a thing simply because you by sharing your experience the next morning it dilutes it yeah I had to really in Buddhism also one does not speak about one spiritual experiences except to one's teacher and I had to sit with that for a long time because Buddhism is a you know an important tradition for me as all the traditional traditions are but particularly Buddhism and I really had to ponder whether I should even be talking about these experiences but in the end my experience was that the universe wanted me to share what it was that she our it had allowed me to experience I didn't I didn't program my experiences I didn't choose what I experienced something else was entirely in control of my experiences through the entire journey and at the end you know the universe made it clear that she said you didn't give yourself those experiences we gave you those experiences those experience Mercer never meant for you by yourself they were always meant for you to share with others and I think we it's basically no one person's experiences are really important but when all of our experiences are shared together in the circle then we begin to have a deeper understanding of this mysterious universe we're exploring yeah and can build a cultural picture that yeah as a context for it yeah just you go back what you said earlier about a few words to do it game differently that you would use different plants almost like and you know different compounds almost like building a house and use different tools for different parts of the construction know do you work with other plants now or did you end your experiences at this 73 photos positions if they thought much personal patience yeah no I still use medicines from time to time them much less than I used to I mean somewhat it's a young man's game a young person's game I'm 70 years old now so if I haven't learned anything right now yeah yeah so you know after I stopped my work the LSD work in 99 and after that from time to time I would do light sessions or I would do psilocybin sessions in a few times ayahuasca sessions or salvia divinorum so I you know broaden my experience by working with those substances but the LSD work was in a category unto itself and and I found one of the things I found was that my body my system was storing energy over time so when I was doing multiple sessions my system was storing energy of those sessions and then using that stored energy periodically to trigger breakthroughs into new levels of consciousness so that I I were to even take a massive dose of LSD today I would not be able to get back to where I was working regularly when I finished my work in 99 it would take years for me to develop the the energy the power to be able to access those deeper dimensions of the universe my understanding over time developed was every step into a deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher energy a higher energetic sate really stood out there long yeah yeah yeah yeah and if this takes a long time to develop the power to access these very very highly energized states of consciousness mmm and I think that some working with with integration particularly with biome you know I noticed there's a lot people can be quite depersonalized disassociated after a very high dose position and one of the things we advisors embodiment as to bring that energy back into the body and to ground the through the earth you know you know not to go and do meditation which is going to get you more into the ethereal realms to bring it back into the earthly realm almost to discharge it's like your body becomes a capacitor for for this energy yeah it's been an empty vessel to to accept it yeah you're right I think it was a good good point to jump into the three other two phases you spoke about how they're cleansing and the ecstatic phase yeah basically working the way I did I found that my sessions basically had two phases though at the beginning of every phase there was some type of intense cleansing or purification process and if you surrender to that if I surrender to that completely that would eventually come hit a peak threshold and then there would be some type of death rebirth process and then the rest of the session was sent in an ecstatic state in some type of transcendent experience of some form or another and that process kept repeating itself over and over through the years you know you think I wonder the nature of the compound itself it's just the way I see work so there's a turnaround point halfway at those doses no I don't think so I think we're looking at it's one of the dynamics of consciousness that when you are opening to deeper levels of consciousness these deeper levels of consciousness require a just to enter them triggers a purification a spontaneous purification of your of your system purification of your thoughts of your emotions purification of your body and so just when you're when you're entering into these very very intense very very pure states of consciousness you just start a spontaneous detoxification process and there's so many concepts and belief systems and emotional complexes that we all carry that have to be taken apart have to be undone and if we're going to experience the universe that deeper level of cynicism ayahuasca the purges is very much associated with ayahuasca but as you point out it it's applicable to all psychotic medicines in which you need to remove the blockages in your own system be they so logical emotional energetic before you can own happen and be open to those and so you don't regulate three factors from those two phases to refresh me well which particular ones are you're plugging into there so there's the expanding and ecstatic face with a sliding line between three functions of the larger Hall which was influenced by three factors that related to H planetary sitting yeah and and then first the the depth of the ecstatic portion of the session would be was influenced by several factors as I came to understand it one of them was the depth of cleansing that had taken place in the first part of the session so usually the deeper the cleansing the deeper the ecstatic revelation ecstatic entry the second one was the depth of cleansing that had taken place in all of the sessions up to that point in time so naturally I say in the book you expect to deeper experience fifty sessions into a journey then on the first couple of sessions into a journey and the third has to do with this energy quality the quality of the the massive amounts of energy that's involved so when you work in serial sessions and I was doing on average about five sessions a year so I worked for four years I stopped for six years and then I worked for ten years and on average I was doing about five a year so when you're working systematically like that you're taking your body and your mind into those states it you build up this energetic momentum it's like an athlete in training you know the more you train you build up this this energy which then carries you through new performance levels and I think that happens with the universe to its it carries you into deeper levels of consciousness I found that I because these sessions were so intense and they were so demanding psychologically and demanding physically I really had to prepare myself for days before every session physically Yoga was chiropractic wise making my body was carefully aligned and then spiritually dietarily spiritually I would there were certain practices that I would do before session and other practices that I would do to integrate the session afterwards so yeah because it's just so extremely intense I was interesting to use the gym breathe there as well not only deep breaths like wind like a bandwidth just now just I'm located woodsy that way yeah well I in certain specific experiences the the breath has isn't is a metaphor that describes the ways in which we connect with humanity we connect with other persons we connect with nature we can enter into states of consciousness or extremely wide so to speak depth is something different depth is entering into contact with deeper levels of reality other systems of reality other beings archetype of reality void the pure void cosmic void types of reality those are different different categories of experience hmm okay there might be a good point to talk about archetypes hmm well let me just kind of lay out some of the sequences the the categories and when I when I got to the end of the journey well I went through what I experiences a series of punctuated death and rebirth experiences so I would break into a new level of consciousness I would then stabilize at that level over multiple sessions and I'd become more familiar with that level and I'd get to understand it more and become more cognitively how it works and energetically would be purified by the process of engaging that level of consciousness and then over time if I kept pushing I would come to a threshold and I would go through another death process and that would drive me into yet another level of reality and it would start all over again having to stabilize my consciousness at that level having to learn how to manage the the factors at level so when I got to the end of the journey and I was looking back I asked myself well how many levels of consciousness did I enter how many fundamental core platforms did I go through and I basically boiled them down to five so there was a level of work at the personal level of consciousness and then there was a level of work at the collective level of collective mind which is where the you know the ocean of suffering work and where the purification was really aimed at the purification of the collective psyche more than the personal psyche and after that there was the archetypal dimension of conscience is entering into archetypal consciousness and then entering into oneness our causal consciousness and then entering finally into what I called the diamond luminosity which is what Buddhism was called dharmakaya a clear light of absolute reality so for me after I went through death and rebirth at a personal level and then after I went through that took about two years and then after two years of work at the collective level working at the in the purification part working in the ocean of suffering work and then experiencing successive deeper initiations into the universe in the chapter that I call initiation in the universe then I was spun into archetypal reality my experience was when I entered archetypal reality I had the extraordinary sensation that I was entering a level of reality that was more real than time and space was it was more real than our lives here was and it it took me a long time you know several sessions to stabilize and to be able to enter that level of real and the nature of death that was required to enter that reality was different than ego death I had to literally die as a human being in order to enter archetypal reality so I found that there was a level of identity that we all have as human beings it's our it's our humaneness it's our human identity that's deeper than our personal identity and the human identity had to die in order to function at a level of consciousness that allowed me to have access to levels of reality beyond human consciousness beyond the collective psyche began there and entering into archetypal reality and there I basically I only spent about a year and a half at that level I mean which is not much time that's just a tip of the iceberg in a way but I experienced out of two levels of archetypal reality one which you might think of as a more of a platonic level I encountered beings phenomena that were vast I mean they were just huge I could not wrap my mind around them I mean I just they were just staggering that they are that they were the forces of nature that were responsible for creating time and space and for orchestrating the events that were taking place in time and space and then did a lower level of consciousness at what I would call a a union level of consciousness I entered into repeated experiences of experiencing the the psyche of the human species or the the literally the collective unconscious how how the system works that the human species lives as a single entity psychologically even physically that our minds are cells within our our collective mind and our bodies are cells within the collective body of humanity I learned that our healing of our individual diseases contributes to a healing of those conditions within the body of humanity as a whole so it was just over and over again being taken into the dynamics of wholeness the wholeness of our species and I think these these experiences which are always there it was like I was being educated one after another first stabilizing at this level going to another level going to another level and I think these experiences were teaching me what I needed to know in order to receive the visions that came later on where humanity is going the birth of the future human the crisis that were coming to in history what that's all about right you know I think what that really shows too is the fractal nature of a little bit of reality the different levels being parts of the whole and it's interesting you mention the entities is something that we tend to associate with DMT more than anything even though we know from those experiences that yes you have to die and it has to be death of the self in order to open up to those those larger rounds I just wanted to acknowledge things I just noticed in my notes um Kalindi EE were you aware of his work I'm sorry say again we were you aware of Kalindi EE numeric wasn't when he was a large advocate for 30 grams of dried mushrooms Plus and he was injuring some very very deep realms of psilocybin he passed for his moon last week I just hurt my niacin and sociologically before I before I forgot no I'm afraid now did you have a teacher during all of this do you know practice a spiritual teacher are well no I consider the universe my only teacher see one of the things that maybe is a little unusual about my experiences compared to other people I've talked to is that I didn't have a lot of contact with individual beings which are so common in the dmt experience and I over time I've really pondered why that was the case and basically I kept being dissolved into levels of being and then being dissolved into deeper levels of being and kind of opening up into vast expanses of consciousness and vast dimensions of and learning how the universe works but not in a way which engaged involved engaging individual beings who live on those levels and about the closest I could come to encountering beings as such like that is when I described archetype of reality but these these realities were so large I the best my mind could do to image them was to image them as galaxies I saw them as galaxies billions and billions of light-years wide they were so formed but in general I mean I have had contact with beings with psilocybin or with ayahuasca things like that but the LSD work just kept dissolving me into deeper and deeper into being itself so that there was always I would encounter an intelligence and an intelligence would guide me and orchestrate and teach me and talk to me and it was an ever deepening cascading deepening of this intelligence but I I never had the sense of encountering are experiencing discrete intelligences so to me the universe is a is an infinite potential and I experienced a dialogue or rapport or dissolving into deeper and deeper and deeper layers of this infinite ocean so I consider I mean I consider the universe my teacher and the universe was always there articulately at the other end but the nature of the intelligence that I was encountering kept changing kept deepening as it went as it took me deeper so it's I think there's a little daring lots about LSD itself in relation to the other compounds I think that there is a kind of resonance between the form of the substance of compounds or plants and the experience to me iced tea has always been a very human centric experience from you know the the therapeutic levels of the individual self and the cleansing right through to our place and the the largest cosmos we can imagine but but as you noted it's not about beings from other realms or other realities or other dimensions it seems to be very grounded in the human psyche and what its infinitely capable of and I don't know I would love to get your thoughts on this whether there has anything to do with the synthetic nature of it being you know discovered by Hoffmann in a laboratory as opposed to occur in the deep jungles or burning bush yeah well you know people a lot of people have a lot of convictions around the difference between synthetic psychedelics inorganic relics yeah and I don't really have a big investment in that distinction I don't have enough data points to really draw a lot of conclusions but I would do have this observation substances the longer humanity has worked with the substance I think there are energetic fields like Rupert Sheldrake's more for genetic fields that develop around a substance so when people have the experience of encountering the ayahuasca deity or the psilocybin deity I cannot but think that in some ways the substance the experience we had with psilocybin or with ayahuasca which humanity has been using for thousands of thousands of years that there's a certain way in which all of humanity's experiences with this substance create a feel surrounding this chemical so when I take this chemical it's not just putting a chemical into my body in some sense I am opening myself to the field if he managed his experience with this substance LSD is a basically a new substance it's a you know it's only a few decades old and 60s and 70s is nothing compared to the length of time that human beings have been using ayahuasca so I have always experienced LSD to be a very clean substance in that respect without a lot of cultural baggage around it using it the way that I did and to me it just it just shatters me it dissolves my consciousness over and over and over again and deeper and deeper levels and takes me into territory which felt kind of from an evolutionary perspective it felt fresh it there were places that I went that did not feel like there were many footprints on them from other human beings and I don't have that experience when I worked with psilocybin or with ayahuasca where the those territory filled more frequently traveled so to speak well that's interesting that you also know the experience of perceiving the universe is feminine yeah for a couple of reasons two reasons that I talked about in the book the first reason is simply because of the tremendous love that the experience of the universe triggered in me and just awoke within me and the deep heartfelt opening and the the depth of of passion that I felt for the universe that was taking me in that love which for me had a feminine quality to it but the other reason was about because of the specific cosmology that emerged in my sessions and this cosmology surprised me it wasn't one that I had internalized or taken in for many of the sources that I had read and the cosmology basically there was an experience a series of experiences that took me back to the beginning of creation back before the Big Bang and I experienced the universe as basically emerging out of this primal oneness which you know the the oneness becomes the two yin-yang and the experience was that out of that to one of those consciousness stayed outside of time and space and stayed intact and the other consciousness began a journey of manifesting time and space and manifesting everything that has evolved in time and space since the Big Bang and so the consciousness that stayed outside in the entire evolution area creation project felt more to me that more quote masculine and the consciousness which created felt more feminine so that it felt congruent with me - in - I had I just had repeatedly the experience of the universe itself as more feminine than masculine and I mean I'd just has that quality to me so the great mother lineage is very strong in me I've always understood myself to be deeply connected to the great mother lineage as when I consider and many cultures around the world as you and I know yes yes being the great mother yeah yeah I consider my work always in service of the great mother yeah as I noted earlier I got to I'm just up to the point of deep time and you boom yeah perhaps you could give us a little insight into the nature of deep time yeah and well early on in my work when I entered into the ocean of suffering during the cleansing part is really really intense collective cleansing when I would come through each session I would be spun into a reality that was so foreign to me that in the beginning I I came back from the my eleventh session and I couldn't remember it I mean I mean I couldn't remember where I had gone took me months to begin to fully remember it and what had happened is I entered what I later came to call deep time for a year in seventh a total of seven sessions I experienced my life as a completed whole start to finish all the days of my life is a simultaneously present now and I experienced the totality of my life beginning to end that required that was so hard for my mind to hold on to because my mind is trained to operate within linear conditions where time flows one moment at a time but to experience all of the moments of my life as a simultaneous present it took literally took me an entire year to learn how to stabilize consciousness at that condition I kept going back and back and back into the same condition so the universe was teaching me how to be conscious at that condition in that condition later I began to enter more radical dimensions of time I entered not personal deep time I entered evolutionary deep time I had experiences of there was an eternity it wasn't timelessness that's a different experience it was different swathes of time it was I would different patterns within time on a scale of a hundred thousand years are within a scale of a million years either simultaneously present or in an accelerated fashion so I could sometimes I would experience centuries going by in seconds but I was experiencing life in terms of the rising and falling of way of some generations just generations coming and going generations after generations in order to understand or to be taught what was happening underneath the evolutionary dance so I just experience so many variations on time that I came to call it deep time different there deep time is entering into a different modality of time consciousness I I do think that there in the universe there are multiple envelopes of time multiple modalities of time linear time is how the world behaves inside times face but as you move to the edges of space you move to the edges of time and there between linear time and timelessness where you're outside of time altogether in that intermediate domain there multiple modalities of time and you can learn to stabilize consciousness at those levels of time and it seemed that the universe wanted to teach me certain things and the only way it could teach me certain things was to teach me how to to stay conscious in these unusual temporal modalities in fact the the last of the what I consider the great visions the last of the great visions took place in the 70th session and it was one of the most extreme strip-down that I went through in any of my sessions and it moved me into the most radical experience of deep time in all of my sessions in fact after this vision the universe basically wrapped it up the next three sessions that kind of wrapped up our work together this was the dominant vision and it took me far far into the deep future into humanity's evolutionary future yeah yes I was gonna ask you what that that window of deep time into the evolution of the human species what what insights that gave you about our future direction yeah well starting at around the twenty third session and repeating itself in a punctuated way over the years the universe kept on taking me into giving me teachings about the human story it was basically giving me the outline of you what you might call the master story and I apologize for the arrogance of that concept I don't mean it as such but it just kept taking me over and over again showing me certain things about humanity it kept emphasizing that we were coming to a crescendo in our evolutionary journey we were coming to a turning point a true before and after point and we're after thousands and hundreds of thousands of years of struggling and of course with reincarnation I believe in reincarnation my first book was on reincarnation I've had lots of experiences around reincarnation so when I talk about humanity evolving for a hundred thousand years I'm this within a reincarnation alfredo genetic but a reincarnation development it kept emphasizing that humanity was growing coming to a turning point in its larger evolutionary story and it was a turning point that was so decisive that we would mark history in terms of the before and after of this point and then in the 55th session it it took me it it kept showing me that there was a a profound opening that was in the process of emerging in the human heart a profound change in the human psyche that was taking place in history but it didn't show me how it was going to accomplish this it could it never showed me how until the 55th session and at that session it took me deep into the future deep into deep time and it took me into the death and rebirth of our species it literally gave me an experience not as Chris page but by this time the boundaries of Chris base had been shattered so many times in so many ways it took me into how the species as a whole was going to experience this death and rebirth so that just as individuals go through death and rebirth and a mystic goes through the dark night of the soul and then the birth and the spiritual reality the entire human species was going to go through a death and rebirth process and it it gave me that experience where we it just did we went through a series this is a process that takes generations to actualize but a process where we it got so bad where there was a falling apart a loss of control a an unraveling of the assumptions that we make in life and wood just broke us down just like in a psychedelic session when you die and are reborn the entire species was going through a loss of control a breakdown and just when it looked like we would all be dead just when it looked like we were coming to an extinction event the worst of it passed and we began to emerge and pick ourselves up and go forward and when we emerged a different humanity was in its place something happened in this death rebirth process in this collective death rebirth process so we were changed profoundly a tremendous Oh opening of the heart an opening of the mind so that the humans that were coming out of the other end this was a ship that took place in the depths of the collective psyche it wasn't taking place at the surface of the individual psyche this is a pivot at the core of the collective unconscious and when this pivot takes place all other heat all subsequent human beings will be born within the contracts or the matrix of this changed collective psyche and it really was literally I think an Enlightenment of our entire species death and rebirth and a spiritual opening of our entire species later I came to understand this in terms of what I call the birth of the diamond Sol my understanding of reincarnation is when we die our consciousness expands into deep spiritual reality and when we're born we get small we become male/female this that you know and then when we excite we could dig when we're born we get small it's like going to colleges but when you go to college you choose specific courses for the semester that's your semesters work then at the end of the semester you go on spring break summer time then you get back small Yin so you just over and over over and over we get big we get small we get big and we get small and if we keep this up for a few hundred thousand years sooner or later the large consciousness which is the consciousness of the soul the consciousness that holds all of our experiences for all of our lifetimes that consciousness which we'd naturally return to when we die in the Bardo condition that consciousness I think awakens inside time and space and this is what I call the birth of the diamond soul we literally wake up to our entire identity and our entire history inside time and space so that we're no longer even tenth to think that our present body and the little bitty consciousness of ego is our true identity the soul wakes up on earth and I think that's what's happening for the entire human race the crises that were experiencing that and we're moving into with global systems crisis and the global ecological crisis we're we're experiencing the ending of a world that was built by the ego in the ego as a magnificent like a magnificent phenomenon but ultimately it's it's cut off from each other it's cut off from itself it's cut off from the other beings the culture that we're living in is a culture that was built by the ego and in order to solve the problems which we are confronting in this generation in this century we have to transcend ego at consciousness we we can't solve these problems at the level of ego at consciousness and I think there's a tremendous evolutionary drive for us to give to wake up to our soul to that soul reality and literally give birth to stole consciousness inside time and space and if we can imagine what it would be like to have an entire species that is awake to their sole reality and now we're talking about a turning point yeah in history and that's what I think is happening I think we are entering a process of labor and labor is a you know a gestation lasts a long time labor is fast and short very very intense very very painful day humanity has been just dating developing this capacity of soul for thousands and thousands and thousands of years I think we are entering labor now this tremendous unraveling this tremendous pain of history that we are entering and will continue to enter for decades still is not an end on apocalypse it's not an end of existence an end of life but it's giving birth to the future human and I think the future human is the diamond soul yes apocalypses revelation it's to lift the violin and to reveal the hidden the unseen than you so you get the feeling that this time is now that this rebirth takes place I mean when we look out at what's going on at the moment it certainly feels like a dramatic catharsis is taking place and you know may they go it's like they're forces of freedom and control are dominating the battle and we can either go in two directions you know you know increasing you know control and totalitarianism or increasing freedom and autonomy and sovereignty and it's interesting because I wonder how much that is a sort of a grand narrative collective story in the spiritual world that because I hear it a lot from many different circles they you know we are birthing into the new age into the new man and and yeah and that would be absolutely beautiful if that was the occasion and he is the case that yes the painful birth that we need to go through in order to transition into a better more functional more balanced species yeah so you know so yeah let me do that right on there well there's a chapter in the book called the birth of the future human and I discussed this in the chapter called the Great Awakening in dark night early dawn this book that I wrote in in 2000 and I go into a deeper in LSE in the mind of the universe and the birth the future human and I was comfortable going into this territory because I'm not comfortable with what some would call his think of as historical speculation and I had begun this work really thinking in terms I was doing this work for my individual healing my individual transformation my individual enlightenment and that just got blown away you know within a few years and everything everything the work the purification the accessing the information the knowledge everything seemed to be in service of the species as a whole that's it's like that's what the divine is really interested in right now not that our species is special in the universe but and but the scale of what the divine is focused in on this planet is species wide it's not so much individual species wide and so this was repeated so many times and so strongly that the entire gist of my 20 year journey ended up being focused on this collective story of death and rebirth so I mean I have deep convictions about I think we've entered the dark night of our collective soul we've entered the dark night which is a period of purification we basically are confronting in a very accelerated manner the sins of the past we would say the sins of our fathers except we were our fathers we are our mothers you know so reincarnation wise we're confronting our history we're confronting the choices that we've made in the consequences of those choices and we are purifying ourselves of the toxins left over by those choices in order to open ourselves up into new dimensions of our being because when we when we open to our soul it opens it has a too immediate effects an enormous expansion of compassion because we we have relationship mean we haven't met each before right you and I are new to each other but how many times has your soul in my soul you know it's different times in history made contact and the people that we have cut our friends and our enemies and we have such a deep deep history on this planet so when when you wake up as a soul in a sense you wake up to that history and it has the effect of unleashing an enormous compassion for not only human beings but all being for all life-forms and then there is when you wake up to that kind of depth it also opens up a deeper experience of communion with cosmic intelligence because it's like the ego is operating under a cloud of obstruction but when the soul awakens then it's easier to enter into conscious rapport with the consciousness of the universe itself so there is literally an awakening to trends to transcended consciousness as well as awakening to tremendous breadth of consciousness that's where I think we're heading yeah and I think you or your um your description the ocean of suffering of experiencing the pain of every woman that at every that it ever existed exemplifies that that when you experience empathetically emotionally with all the beans that you have been in this model of reincarnation then that bike scene has to lead to something larger it has to you know resolve into a higher level so when did you when did you write dark night early dawn in relation to to this ball game I wrote dark at early dawn I wrote it in 95 96 I stopped my work in 99 when I had already entered the diamond luminosity years the last five years of my work were centered on what I call the time at the Manasa T work but I deliberately when I wrote dark and early dawn I deliberately restricted myself for the most part to analyzing only the sessions that emerged in the first half of my journey I did not discuss what was happening in the second half I needed more time to digest them so in Elysee in the mind of the universe I go back to the very beginning the whole structure of the book just start in the first session taken all the way through every chapter deals with a certain number of sessions just do it layer by layer this is where it started this is where it went this is where it ended so dark night early dawn was written basically about three-quarters of the way through the journey itself okay that's interesting because I had not read it and so I asked what about seeing him was on write to just throw some questions now about that book which which he had read and no he asked him a few actually um one that stands out to me here is um as a teacher of comparative religion your take on the problem of theodicy the the problem of reconciling a magnificent intelligence with the radical examples of evil in history in prison day is there is allusion to the destructive phenotype within human minds the the poem of suffering and or some people would say the problem of evil I don't use that category because that's just a theological interpretation of the experience of suffering and pain you know I think Rama Christian was right Ramakrishna said if you want to understand God you must be willing to look suffering in the face because suffering doesn't come from any secondary source it's not a demonic you know agency that you have to you have to look deeply into the logic of the universe and the logic of creation if you want to understand how to reconcile the intelligence of the universe and the compassion of the universe with the fact that existence hurts so much there's so much pain and suffering here and I think the key is understanding that creation or evolution or the manifestation of life we are very it's incomplete we're not finished we are we're building something and and the what we are building is something which is evolving and developing over billions and billions of years so the universe says we find it now and as we measured in the last ten thousand years say it's just a drop in the bucket compared to the billions of years that preceded it and the billions of years that come after it so it's clearly there's a great deal of pain and suffering in life as we experience in its current form but we are evolving and developing and becoming more consciousness we're learning from our choices we're getting more and more control over our bodies in our mind and we're going to keep this up not for another couple of decades or a few more hundred years or even a few thousand years we're going for millions and millions and billions and billions of years so to me suffering the the scale of suffering has to be understood or the the logic of suffering has to be understood not necessarily in terms of just what has been accomplished up to now but we have to understand that we are in a process we are in developmental process and it's an incomplete process and so it's kind of like when you're building a house and you just have the stud walls up and you have the trusses up but you don't have the roof on and the rain comes and it gets wet because there's no roof because you haven't built the roof yet well humanity hasn't achieved levels of capacity that would allow us to stop the suffering and it's and it's not because we're bad and it's not because we're being forced or manipulated by dark and demonic forces it's just a radically incomplete process we're trying to continue the process as fast as we can now do you believe within this model of yin and yang of their being perfect balance and duel forces throughout the universe that the suffering is balanced equally by please and good in the world that for every you know starving child experiencing the pain of hunger there is a person experiencing the beauty of a sunset do you think it exists in that kind of balance I don't think so I don't think so because that would mean if in a long-term wise if we were ever going to continue or deepen our joy we would be deepening and continuing our suffering and I don't think that's where we're going necessarily I think we are you know I asked my classes sometimes when I was teaching if I draw a line on the board and the evolutionary line and so I would ask how far are we on the evolutionary line are we like 90% along this line well and if you were 90% along the line then we have a certain set of conclusions that would seem to follow when we look at life and try to understand it but what if we're only one percent on this line what if everything that we've developed is really just a little bitty bitty bit of this entire process then that opens up the picture enormous Lee we're up until just a few decades ago a few hundred years ago yeah it opens up oh we used to think the universe was 6,000 years old because we added up all the agents yeah now we understand billions and billions of years old just since this first Big Bang and we don't know whether they had been bangs before if it's an expanding and contracting universe it may have been there may have been other universes that feed into the intelligence of this manifestation of this universe so the challenge here is to is to engage and comprehend the scale of the project that we are involved in that are to put it a different way if you want to speak within Devine terms or is to understand the scale of the agenda of the divine it's like we're literally just children we only became self conscious a few thousand years ago we only beneath the level of our individual consciousness to discover the dimensions of our mind which are universal well maybe four or five thousand years ago we're just beginning to wake up on this planet and this planet has been four-and-a-half billion years in the making 13.7 billion years in the Gau galactic scale of things and we're just waking up we're just getting started here and so it's not surprising from that perspective and of course suffering is the great great challenge I mean as you say the children who are dying the children who are suffering from hunger the injustice is that that surround us completely I'm not making light of any of those things in saying this we have to address those things we have to expand and continue to work on those things but philosophically we have to thought of understand that we're just beginning to wake up to the scale of the universe that gave birth to us and is continuing to give birth to us from that perspective we have a lot of work to do but we have a lot of hope I really do think we're becoming a species of Christ a species of Buddhas a species of the Prophet we are becoming an entirely higher order of species over time and this is going to be what we're doing is extraordinarily important this time in history but very very hard work but when we go through this process when we give birth to the future human like a mother who gives birth to a child when she holds her child she doesn't forget to pain but she knows that the pain was worth it in order to deliver this child and when we give birth to the future human we will look back at all of the suffering of all of history and we will say it was worth it for where we are and where we're going so so if I'm here at the balanced rebalancing and pain and joy as laid out on this scale of deep time which which I recall you you're referring to bhakti in relation to that concept of you know loving devotion and you know you know leaving all beings of pain and sufferings yeah yin yang yin yang is as a an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality which then divides into the ten thousand things becomes the ten thousand things the complexity of the evolving of life but I don't think I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity good/bad male/female things like this but the bhakti is a different issue and this was a surprise to me but you know in Hinduism therefore systems of spiritual work for yoga's this Yana yoga the yoga of meditation karma yoga the yoga of action blanking on part of the bhakti is the is the yoga of emotion it's loving God it's becoming awakened through love I had always been attracted to more the mental forms a spiritual practice of all the various yoga's and Hinduism I was least attracted to bhakti the emotions the cultivation of emotional relationship with the divine and yet I found in the psychedelic work bhakti was activated bhakti was very powerfully activated so that I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection to the universe and experience of the universe so that it just it became a love relationship and that's why for me I mean everybody has to do their own vocabulary for the ultimate reality but my vocabulary for ultimate reality I call the absolute my beloved the beloved just because if that's the bhakti quality yeah I just my heart yeah I've noticed that with with five him you know when when everything is stripped away and there is that zero point singularity that everything is fused into one point the only thing left is love the only thing that can exist or the only thing at least to exist is this Universal love and it's it's quite interesting I mean I guess from a neuro reductionist perspective you can say that it's because your serotonin receptors of being completely flooded yeah love is the quality of the the experiential quality of awareness oneness and love are two different sides of the same coin because when you dissolve into oneness then instantly love is the experience that the universe has for itself there is no division in oneness so oneness is all-embracing so we might experience this as compassion our love but the logic of love is the logic of oneness everything short of oneness is fragmented okay so would you agree with this perspective that I see a lot less like you like community there the universe creates separation in order to experience itself in order to experience the you know the joy and the pain because one has a night experience itself alone yeah it's you know that it really presses the question I mean when we're asking the question why existence why is there anything went when there was the primal void when let's say to use God language when the divine was and complete in perfect equanimity within itself why did it manifest the universe knowing what would be involved knowing all the pain and suffering that was involved what was that about and one of the proposals is well this is a way of the divine knowing itself this is a way of learning itself personally I've always I've never found that very persuasive I mean I understand it and I think this is a truth to it but to me to make creation an exercise in self-knowledge I think that that never had never was very satisfying to me another aspect of it I think is that creation is a way for the divine to share its being so all of us from my cosmology all of us are sparks of light that emerge out of the primal light so all of us are aspects of the divine little bitty pieces broken off out of the the primal one and those little bitty pieces grow and grow and grow and grow and as they grow and grow they're actualizing their innate potential they're actualizing their divinity and in the end it is as if you have a one light which is growing billions and billions of light out of its own one light so it's its sharing of its being a cascading of the sharing of its being which I'm sure is an inadequate model by itself when I've asked the universe simile and and and the full of the universe being this diamond with infinite facets each fashioning an individual's human you know showing the piece of life that is part of the whole yeah yeah and we always of course always have to remind ourselves that what is he merged up to this point in time is just the tip of the iceberg it's just getting started so we have to kind of imagine our a million years from now which is nothing in evolutionary time but a million years from now what we might be envisioning the answer to this question to be what is the purpose of creation why is why is this happening a million years from now we're going to understand it and have a much deeper answer to that question and a million years after that we're going to have a deeper answer that question so I just there's a certain way in which I caution closure on these questions I'd rather be agnostic somewhat open-ended I do think it has to do with self knowledge self expression I think it has to do with sharing nature open up opportunities for life to breed life life to grow life from we seems very much seeking the moment we seen a lot of people fall into the trap of certitude of knowing there's some grand design behind it all whether it be you know in cinah sticker bales but and this time monsoons and people seem to be really struggling with with that and looking for answers that that resolved some kind of you know provide us energy good luck yeah exactly ya know when we dissolve into the universe when we just die and die and die and dissolve into the universe we tap into this so all so many of us tap into this condition where we experience the intended nosov it we we experience the the meaningfulness of existence and we walk away come away with it saying there is a plan there is a purpose there is a project here but then when we try to describe exactly what is the plan what is the purpose I think we very quickly reached the limits and and it's the limits are simply the limits that are built into our evolutionary condition of this moment for this species in this planet in this evolutionary period I mean we literally I don't think we have a brain big enough to begin to comprehend masu scale yeah so a certain we can feel it we confirm it we get asserted but closure is it's the one thing to decide about nature now L sort of drive to find the answers and pin them down you know it's it's you know rather futile perhaps that is what gets us into so much trouble no certainly one of the things you mentioned in dark night early dawn homeowner Atticus yeah and and the whites producing me antigens as you know a condition for the evolution of humanity genius well the concept of home owner Atticus is simply a way of putting language and and if different people have different ways of languaging homeless beer Alice the future human the diamond soul this is just different ways of articulating what I think is a very very widespread collective intuition perception and that is that that humanity is growing into something new that there is an evolutionary development so we go from Homo habilis homo what not Homo sapiens and there's something after what we are now there's something coming and we generate different words for it but the and certainly this is so strong in psychedelic experience that we are an unfinished species that we are developmental species and we're and we're not just getting we're not just getting smarter or more compassionate in incremental ways I think there are major turning points where like the rules change when we go through these thresholds we are coming into a bifurcation point in history we either make it across this threshold or probably go extinct I personally believe that we will make it across this threshold we will make this jump and when we make this jump however long it takes us thousands of years hundreds whatever however long it takes us that's not going to be the end point that's just going to be the new platform and we will eventually reach the end of that platform and we're gonna make a jump into yet another because that's the scale of what we're engaged in of what we're involved in so how do you Eddie see psychedelics as a catalyst and and this moment obviously is a huge push for them to be used only within the medicalised model as therapeutic tools with trauma and then there's you know the proposal of modern-day mystery schools which I personally think is greatly under under focused yeah where do you see them it's like he likes playing a role in this well I understand the in the psychedelic community the very strong emphasis on demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of psychedelics yeah I think it's really important that we that we not blow this opportunity we have we kind of blew it in 60s you know it blew up in our faces we lost the right to use these things we had to go underground to use them and it's really important that we have this new opportunity that we document things that we demonstrate their effectiveness and right now their effectiveness is being demonstrated in their therapeutic potential but if we do this if we keep going it's only going to be a matter of time before mainstream thinkers begin to understand that the why is it that psychedelics are so therapeutically effective because they open up a communion with the deeper with deeper dimensions of mind and in the early stages this encounter with the deeper dimensions of our own on our consciousness unconsciousness is very cleansing it's very healing it's very therapeutically efficacious can be demonstrated but if we but that's just the tip of the iceberg we go deeper we go deeper we go deeper it opens off our relationship to each other it opens up our relationship to the planet other life-forms it opens up a relationship to spiritual reality personally I was trained as a philosopher of religion it's always been the philosophical import of psychedelics which is interested in me I'm not a clinician I'm not a therapist I've always interested in the philosophical or cosmological opportunities and I think in that perspective we're coming to a critical moment in history and it's not enough just to heal us at this moment in history we have to heal not simply the personal unconscious so that's important it's very important but we have to heal the soul we have to heal the fundamental human condition we have and that means recovering an understanding of what we are who we are where we are what existence is about and I think psychedelics are coming at a you know the rediscovery of psychedelics in western industrial cultures because indigenous cultures have had them you know a long time but in this culture where we have lost contact with the deeper levels of our own psyche we've lost contact with the consciousness of the earth we've lost contact with the consciousness of the creator of galaxies psychedelics have this opportunity to awaken us quickly draw us into an awareness of this deeper dimension at exactly the time when we need it because we can't get through this period of history with the limited understanding of ourselves that have grown out of 19th century science this materialist mechanistic reductionistic understanding which is just a it's an absolutely devastating worldview to try to live in you know that you that existence comes into that we come into existence by accident it's all random it has there's no meaning to it there's no meaning to our individual challenges there's no meaning to history that is an absolutely devastating worldview and it leads to the kind of planet that we have developed now where we just basically try to eat it all alive and get as many experiences and as much of experience as we can possibly because when we die it's all over and it was all an exercise in futility anyway well psychedelics and help us understand that that's not true it's a very different agenda it's almost like they had the the perfect tools for the human condition at this point in time I really are and yeah it feels like you know there is a grander scheme playing out with their own essence and how do you think we get so I get Alex or what do you think is a good pragmatic way to get psychedelics and field of philosophy more well I think the therapists have to do their work you know they have that that's what's really going to open the door they have to do their work they have to study the physiology of psychedelics they have to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelics but the mystery school aspect the philosophical aspect that's there I think that the key to opening to this deeper dimension in mainstream society if you're working at the fringes of society the edges of society we're already open to the mystery school use of psychedelics but for mainstream culture to begin to open to this dimension of psychedelic work I think the therapists have to lead the way into it once we see that that's being demonstrated then I think society will be more open to the more exotic qualities of psychedelics but we have a lot of maturing to do there I mean we have so many psychedelics which unleash so many different experiences it's an overwhelmingly complex maze if you go from five Meo to salvia divinorum psilocybin and Iowa so many different experiences it takes a huge expansion of our cosmology to understand even to begin to understand how all of these experiences can coexist within a meaningful framework of a deeper understanding of existence even just to begin that understanding we have to be highly motivated and I think the therapists are the ones that are opening that door for us I think you quite understand is that these are these are plants that have for whatever reason evolved human neurotransmitters and that the plants being much older than us and the evolutionary scale of things almost trying to you know teach us yeah a simpler way of being one of a bit of description but to look back throughout you know historical lineage and perhaps examine where we went wrong yeah yeah where we went wrong again is we don't blame a first grader for being first being six years old you know it's just like you know they didn't do anything wrong they're just six years old you know and humanity you know we made mistakes we've done dumbass things we've done this and that the other terrible things but in a larger sense we're just young inexperienced not understanding and because we didn't all understand we make mistakes you know in Eastern traditions I say the core problem the core problem is not that we're evil the core problem is that were ignorant we literally don't know and because we don't know we'd make bad choices and because we make bad choices those have bad consequences but the more we understand and they so we can make them say yeah I like the analogy okay yeah I like the analogy of don't judge a tree because it grew a little bit this way because it didn't get enough light from the other side it just is it's just you know we accept but much more usually than we do with people yeah yeah yeah exciting times we live in I want to ask I know we're coming to sort of towards the end of the discussion that I want to mention something at the end the last chapter of my book is called coming off the mountain and I basically discussed what happened when I stopped my sessions in the years after I stopped the sessions and I just want to mention that because I think we're it's getting easier and easier with the substances that are available to us to break through consciousness to break into intimacy with the universe to break into transcendence you know to excess information my experience was when I stopped my sessions in the years had followed I thought that since I had been given so many gifts and since I had been had so many mystical experiences and so many experiences of intimacy with the being of existence and dissolving into you know the primordial light of existence I thought it would be easy to stop my sessions and just step away and I would be able to be nourished by those experiences and what I found was that in the end there was such a deep existential longing to return to those dimensions of existence and I might I knew that I had to stop for reasons I explained in the book I had to stop this work I came to a point where it just I knew I needed to stop and slow things down and I knew when I stopped that I would never go back into such intimacy with the divine during my lifetime it would only happen with that I would return to such depth of place and I found myself slowly entering a conditioned world I was just waiting to die I was you know taking care of my children teaching my classes doing the things that I do but in my heart of hearts I was just waiting for this life to be over so that I could return to the full intimacy of the divine and in time I began to realize this this is not right this is not the way this work is supposed to end and I had been so careful to integrate every session to integrate all of my work as I went and not get ahead of myself that I it wasn't clear to me what where I had gone wrong my life was screaming failure to integrate but it wasn't clear how I where I had failed to integrate because I paid so much attention to integration and I learned that integrating a session is different than integrating an entire journey and my journey had taken me so deeply into transcendence that I had thought of lost my footing in the world of eminence it's all the divine the physical world is the divine but I had entered so deeply into the transcendent divine that I had become I I was unlost my footing inside the imminent divine and it took years it took me about ten years to get really grounded back in space-time reality so that I could live the remainder of my years with in the joy of space-time reality and I mention this because I think many people as we have more experience of transcendence we'd naturally want to go there or let they are come in here more completely I think it's really important to address the issue of integration while we're going into these states to integrate integrate integrate and integrating a journey is different than integrating individual sessions it's a it's a really delicate process and so I mentioned my own mistakes in order to encourage other people not to make those mistakes right and thank you for mentioning that that's that's quite potent and after this goes to ear the Australian psyche like society's running a large integration workshop you know and has the same before with people having difficulty integrating say such a feat experience like five and you know their embodiment that eminence that experience of the time in everyday life and and the small things and being in nature you know eating clean and just looking after the presence rather than constantly seeking this transcendent experiences yo-yo - that's a beautifully permanent way to surround the interview half there's a couple of quotes that really jumped out at me from the book and I think one that fits quite well here too is you said it's all too easy to think that because we have had a deep and profound experience we have become deep and profound s elves this is a fools delusion I think I may never yeah drop that right yeah yeah the greatest danger I think of working with psychedelics as psychic inflation and we can we can over value the temporary experiences and undervalue and undervalue the stable platforms of our day-to-day consciousness it's in Maslow's terms we can overestimate the value of our peak experiences and underestimate the value of Plateau experiences so we can have a very very profound spiritual experience on Saturday and still be an [ __ ] on Monday yeah yeah it's it's certainly visible within you know some aspects of this community yeah we're we're

      <p>hello and welcome to conscious living my name is Mark Karan and today I'm coming here live from the beautiful I am awake Foundation Center where they do Consciousness research and a lot of really interesting work in the field of spirituality medicines Consciousness and transformation I was blessed to be invited and uh I'm actually broadcasting live from here today uh in this episode of conscious living radio where it's going to be another spear plant medicine focused program and I'm happy to invite my good friend and partner of the conference Steven Gray and uh Stephen always a pleasure to have you here we're going to be airing our program uh today on 100.5 cfro FM in Vancouver Co-op radio we're happy to have been running that program for over 15 years now locally and Stephen you've been a guest many times and really a co-host in many programs so thank you for joining me in what's I'm sure going to be a really really great conversation uh with our guests today absolutely well Stephen I I guess you know you're a man of many words today so why don't you introduce Our Guest you've done it many times that's for sure yeah happy to um well that's partly because uh um I have a big heart uh feeling toward Chris but also an immense amount of respect for him as a person and for the work that he's done on behalf of the rest of us um in elucidating central issues of our time so um Chris um uh I could ask you um for a very brief synopsis of uh that 20-year Journey but maybe you'd allow me to stumble through it then you can sit back and smile and see if I got it right um so um uh welcome to the people who are alive and those who are going to join us later uh uh Chris beige the story I know about Chris is that uh he is now a retired professor of religion and philosophy or relig studies and philosophy from Ohio State University and Youngstown Ohio and early in his career uh he uh well he he was always interested in uh mysticism and deep spiritual exploration and he came upon the work of the legendary um excuse me psych psychiatrist stanislav gr who pioneered a protocol for working with um high doses of LSD in particular and Chris undertook what amounted to to what turned out to be a 20-year journey of 73 high does LSD sessions uh following the Stan gra protocol those were sessions using 500 to 600 micrograms of LSD which for any of you who are not familiar with that kind of calculation that's a high dose um and um uh part that protocol involves um at home or in a you know safe quiet space uh with uh headphones on and a carefully curated playlist um excuse me eye shades to keep block out the light so that inter Visions are not obstructed or mitigated and a um uh a qualified sitter the person that he had in this case is a therapist was a therapist and so knew what she was doing with the situation and the following day um so he generally did this on a Saturday um and then the following day again uh following the gra protocol he spent basically the whole day as far as I recall um with those headphones on again to kind of twigger memories of what was playing on the music when he had certain kinds of experiences and visions and then meticulously transcribing all that so Chris is the author of several books including a book that I long before I ever met him um uh from 20 years ago or so called Dark Knight early Dawn which was really a really impressive book I really liked it um standout book I still have it in my shelves back here um the living classroom which I have not read um and hope to because there's a new edition coming out I believe right Chris yep yeah and uh the um incredible LSD in the mind of the universe subtitled diamonds from Heaven which many people have read now so um excuse me uh I just want to add a little bit more about um how I understand what happened in that 20year Journey mind you this would be like an all day description uh if it were to do justice to what happened but um the the very very short version is and again please correct the nuances of this if I didn't quite remember it correctly Chris um in each one of those 73 Journeys the first two hours was as you described it in the book I believe Chris at one point um sometimes exquisitly painful um as you had to go through uh the difficult process which uh most most of us probably would never want to go through actually um of ego dissolution and Beyond in a sense Beyond ego personal ego uh dissolution but letting go of any kind of identity even as a human as I recall um and then what happened and again please correct my language if I haven't got it quite right Chris but as I recall and in my language you broke out into what you have called in various ways um but one way is uh the vast intelligences of the universe and and believe me folks I this is no exaggeration the kind of material that Chris you might say downloaded or brought back is absolutely stunning and absolutely relevant to what's going on on the planet um one of the things that's most in my mind anyway important and absolutely Central about uh the things that Chris downloaded as it were um is that um especially in the I I believe the latter third or so of the 20 years he started to get increasingly clear and I would say or interpret it as confident messages that we are uh well he had already heard I guess that we'd been we are going through as a species a a death and rebirth trajectory or process um that has been coming toward us for perhaps hundreds of thousand years or whatever um uh and excuse me but the confidence that I just mentioned uh implied that in the later years as I recall Chris um these voices or this intelligence started indicating um a greater likelihood that we would indeed somehow get through this um and and uh that we would come out into um what you might call a natural state of being on this planet uh you've labeled it the birth of the future human um so uh there are so many questions we could ask you about that uh but but let me ask you a two-part question to start with first of all uh correct me on anything that I didn't quite get right and secondly um I've been thinking a lot about this um off and on it's Central to you know my life and where my mind wants to go and so one thing that I'm wondering about is um you have I think you first said you thought it this process might take hundreds of years before something you know the the light might shine again so to speak but I think it was in a either an email or a phone conversation in the last few months you said you might have had to correct that to say thousands of years or more than a thousand years um so I'm trying to keep this simple and turn it over to you um uh but uh the context of that question that I'm going to put to you is that um one of the things that I and I think Mark also was really tuned into and probably you is that there's an incredible amount of energy going on right now on the planet to try to recorrect that uh dis spiritual disconnection um uh so you know I guess the question is is it really going to be a complete you know emptying and dying off over the next decades or might there be a Crossfade where um things start to um uh lighten up or you know the light starts to shine in more um to counterbalance that um dissolution so to speak species dissolution over the next decades for example pardon me one more little thing because you know this you're the person who turned Dwayne Elgen on to me for my book How psychedelics can help save the world and he laid out a sort of a possible scenario over the next six or seven decades that might result in what he called the birth of a mature planetary civilization so how are you seeing all that now timelines and all that yeah first Stephen thank you buddy for that very nice and warm introduction I really appreciate our friendship and I appreciate the what you what you're doing with the conference and Mark you too this is a great conference it's my favorite psychedelic conference to participate in and I always find it such a rich rich setting in audience and soup uh to ask and answer to address these types of questions so to focus specific speically in the question you ask I would strengthen the Visionary component it was really less like messages downloading as deep and profound immersion into trans temporal States Of Consciousness going into what I call Deep time letting go moving outside linear time and also uh these these Visions started coming into me when I was a good 12 14 years into my process so a lot of things that happened before then ego death entering into this Collective suffering of entering into what I think is um some dimension of the collective unconscious of humanity which stores all of its pain and suffering that Humanity has experienced just as an individual stores their individual trauma going through that and going into um archetyp of reality and when I was in archetyp of reality beginning this work I began to be download a series of visionary encounters which kept on showing me the same basic story that Humanity was coming to a pivot point in its evolutionary Journey that this was that we're like a the karmic screams of History we entering a canyon we were about to go through a revolutionary pivot that would be Retros we would see it in time as a before and after transformational event of an event that was so powerful it was going to literally trigger a shift in the collective psyche of humanity so that all beings born after this shift had taken place would be operating out of a different inner landscape a different Collective psychic landscape uh and this was R I just was completely unprepared for this because I had begun this work thinking that this was about personal transformation and then thinking it was about maybe personal Awakening Spiritual Awakening but then I enter these profound Collective territories and then I began to have these Visionary downloads about where the Divi where the creative intelligence of the universe or where the Divine intelligence was taking Humanity where all this was going and so there's these these deep experiences of uh extraordinary Spiritual Awakening taking place at a collective level extreme transformation an a deep intelligence working inside nature inside history underneath us all bringing us about and then but it didn't show me how this was ever going to take place it didn't show me the how of it and then in 1995 which look how long ago this is almost 30 years ago uh I went through a very deep experience in which I was dissolved well beyond egoic identity dissolved into the human species became one with the Human family and in that condition experienced a the death and Rebirth of humanity a profound unraveling a loss of control uh it was a Global Systems crisis that seemed to be triggered by a cascading series of Eco crises uh it was it was excruciating to experience and it kept building an intensity and I experienced this not as a human being not as an individual human being but I experienc this as the species and then it seemed to be getting deeper and deeper we were all forced into survival mode uh and just when it was at its worst the peak passed and the dangers began to recede and we began to pick ourselves up and to put the pieces back together and when we did we were changed we found that something had been Unleashed in us something had been tapped into something had been broken open at the very deep level of our being so that when we began to build after this crisis all of our work all of our being all of our relationships were filled with new insights new values new understandings of the human project and there was a creative contagion that were the work of individuals and collectives fed back into each other that was just spiraling us into very quickly in a into a new condition I think now now that's the basic outline and that's clear uh but like Black Elk in the visions that he received as a young boy about the future of his people the my Visions did not come with dates and it did not come with a lot of detail uh there were in a lot of attention paid to the mechanisms involved but not to the specific pattern of causation other than this escalating Global Eco crisis also it did not come with dates so I don't really have a sense of uh well of from the Visionary perspective when this will happen how long it will last so in order to fill in all that information I have to turn to the scientist in terms of their calculations for the depth and the speed with which the Eco crisis is moving uh I turn to people like d Elgen who has been processing all this information for decades and I've come to First I've been surprised that the crisis is coming out as as fast as it has I thought we had more time but it's coming out as fast it's coming out as hard we're still in the early stages and I think Dwayne is right the next 50 years are going to be absolutely pivotal in terms of the intensity of the ecological forces that will be bearing down on us that we'll have to be responding to I don't think we have a thousand years if if we don't address this I don't think I I think of this as kind of and again I don't say this as a psychonaut or as a Visionary I say this just as a person trying to understand historical information I think this thing may take three or four generations and if we don't make the pivot within that time frame we may lose the planet I think the 21st century is the critical Century that is going to bring us to our knees and force us to make choices that we're not willing to make now for a variety of different reasons yeah um and then and I think this is going to be such a deep pivot it's going to be result in a a shift in what I might call the plate tectonics of the collective psyche the shift at the very very core of our being and in in other ways I I think this represents a culmination of a reincarnational process which has been building for thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of years I think we've been gestating the next iteration of the human condition for all this time we've been reincarnating learning learning exploring growing becoming more gestation is long labor is short and intense life-threatening I think we've been in gestation for a long time and we are entering into labor which is it's going to to be a volatile and very dangerous period And I think we will give birth to this new human this future human many people have these are having this Vision they call it different things homo spiritualis homon noeticus uh but basically there is this common intuition that something new is coming up underneath us it's coming into expression underneath us and it's being driven by the same intelligence that drove the creation of galaxies the creation of the planet the emergence of life on the planet the emergence of conscious Awareness on the planet this is being driven from deep inside the process now I think that we classically say there are no certain outcomes everybody has to exert full and complete exertion for us to get through this like labor it's potentially life-threatening and mothers die in labor children die and labor all the time I understand that and I really endorse that and at the same time the entire trajectory of my psychedelic experience particularly those in the last five years or so took me so deep into the future with such realistic perception and gave me experiences of what this future human will be like and those touches of the future of humanity just bring me to my knees they're so extraordinarily beautiful uh it's it's our deepest dreams come true and I experienced this pivot as something which was yet to be accomplished but also had already been accomplished so that from Deep time I experien this as an actuality that had taken place and yet for my linear time it's an actuality which is yet to be take place uh and so in my heart I don't doubt that Humanity will make it through this transition my concern is how many of our children how many of the world's children will have to die before we come to our spiritual senses so that definitely leaves it open for as you say incredible exertion which is something that's really important to people like Mark and I very important oh yeah let me mention in that context one other thing one of the things that this series Visionary series showed me is that as we enter deeper into crisis the whole uh foundation of the psyche and our culture will be shifting into what uh chaos theoreticians would call non nonlinear systems there'd be so much energy so much uh engagement to high energy engagement that we would be shifting out of a linear Dynamic of history into a nonlinear and in nonlinear we know something about how nonlinear systems behave and some of the characteristics and one of the important characteristics is in a nonlinear condition systems are particularly susceptible to small influences small pert perturbations and that means as we go into this crisis the actions of individuals will have proportionately greater impact than they would have had at earlier more quiet periods of History so the individual becomes a a more Dynamic player moving forward than individuals have been in the past that's an incredibly important message for people go ahead Mark I see your mouth [Laughter] moving well you did partly um answer what I was thinking a little bit uh Chris because you know there's so much you said there and then my question is is what can we do as individuals as groups as collective society and you know it's hard enough to organize important stuff in the world uh for for a lot of people how do you suggest that we move forward um from an starting as me to we to the many what what do you think is a good approach for that yeah you know I think they're probably people who are better qualified and more skilled at filling in that particular P piece of how can we respond I mean I know Dwayne Elgen is really good at that other people are really focused on how can we uh move forward dynamically creatively uh in this process uh and so I'd rather not I know Barbara Marx hubard was great remember on her wheel and all the different professions I think it's going to take all of us to get through this it'll take all the scientists all the Educators all the politicians all the artists it's going to take every one of us and all the skills that we bring to our various livelihoods to move into this what I would offer is the metaphysical perspective that comes from reincarnation research and without going into the data supporting this but the basic vision is when we incarnate we choose our incarnation we choose the time and place and circumstances of our birth and therefore it's it's an axom of my thought that all the human beings on the planet right now knew what they were getting into when they chose to Incarnate in this Century under these very demanding circumstances and they chose to Incarnate with a specific kind of karmic agenda with a specific sense of how to contribute so I think each one of us need needs all we need to do is look deeply look under our feet to look at where we are who we are how we are positioned and the question is not really I think how do we find the right thing to do I think the deeper question is will we have the courage where do we find the courage to do what we discover that we can do absolutely the essence of this pivot is a pivot into Oneness an Awakening of Oneness underneath our feet which will completely change technology how we apply Technology International conflict social relationships organizational Society uh that fundamental Awakening in the human heart the healing of the human heart and Awakening Awakening into a true deep Vivid mystical experience of the fundamental Oneness of all life and that means uh that's an inclusive vision and so as we move toward that time in history and back into ecological balance of course a Oneness that includes all living species on the planet the more we become the the human being that is trying that the earth needs right now that culture needs right now the more we accelerate the transformation of this this transformational change in our own role in it we must become the future being that earth needs and as we do we enter into synergistic relationship with other beings who are also working to become what the planet needs right now yeah beautiful that's not very no specifics there are other people who are better with the specifics yeah right well I I I agree with you you know I mean in the sense that we don't know what people need to do and if I may dare a bit of a provisional answer about that um I've got Mark interested in this term that I got from Steven Herod buer which I believe he translated from William Blake which is follow the golden thread and um so um you know obviously I mean I think we all know as a it's almost a platitude in some ways that the uh the the inner work is the foundation for moving out into the outer work and that one would hope that if the inner work is being done properly effectively then uh you can follow the golden thread or as they sometimes say let go and let God and then it's like that's I think another um Central component of this revision that we're dealing with is we're moving hopefully or we need to move from sort of uh head-based calculation of how to move through the world to heart-based or intuitive based you know through that and then I just add one more thing before tossing it back to you if I may Chris um one of our other speakers Mary Sanders just sent me the title of her talk for the spirit plant medus conference conference for this year and it's reimagining Collective care as a path to Liberation and seems to me that's another Central component of it you know you talk about us moving toward Oneness so the recognition of the power of uh connection and shared vision and shared prayer you might even say shared manifestation uh seems to me Central to uh this movement forward yeah I think so I just wanted to add one more thing if I could gentlemen um because Stephen you said something about you know you mentioned the head and you mentioned the heart and I think it's because we have so much wisdom and knowledge you know education type knowledge um that it's when we lead that with our heart is so much more powerful because you know we can just repeat what we hear what we read what we learn but it's a in my experience you know in terms of what I share I know when I'm in my head and I'm in my heart and the difference that it makes in Rapport and relating and same as when somebody's presenting or you're working with someone you know the difference between that and it kind of reminds me of a a quote that I always loved hearing that made a lot of sense was the longest journey you'll ever take is the one between your head and your heart yeah now I would add the third piece and that is the body the body's wisdom and of course this is the context within head and heart meat uh and of course one of the reasons we're in so much trouble in terms of the planet is uh we just our theologies and philosophies had tended up to aimed us away from the body away from physical embodiment away from the earth uh and ignoring the messages that we've been getting from the earth and so the an opening of the heart at at that level an opening of the mind at a level and an opening of our body to our body as a cell in the body of the planet so lots of levels going on all at the same time yeah yeah very interesting yeah and to add to that if I may because the body of course is the connector between spirit and and and the planet with the importance of of food and what we put in our body so you know our conference called Spirit plant medicine all plants have Spirit whether it be broccoli cannabis iboga mushrooms whatever it is and the importance I think for us to get back to clean nutritious food that isn't contaminated in the same way lets our body work in a much better way and when we acknowledge the plants the spirit of the plants whether it be a psychedelic medicine or something psychoactive to something that's just um something to nurture our body for nutrition and health and vitamins and all the things that we need in a good way makes that connection even more powerful and I feel that you know in so many ways when we look at the mass population of you know let's just say North America you know the quality of our store-bought food is you know really we all need to become aware of so no more beer and pizza Mark no well everything in moderation I have to believe you know it's it's like you know every now and again you have to have a zag or not but you understand what I'm saying it's just yeah what you put in is of course no that's a really important one I think um you know Chris you might have things to say about that but I'd like to try leading you in another direction if I may just before I know Mark's going to want to turn it to questions soon um you know you've spoken uh obviously about the birth of the future human um and um um there's a um there's a kind of um humorous uh saying from the famous baseball uh Catcher And pitcher from the Yankees from way back when Yogi Bara who was prone to these sort of malapropisms that ended up kind of making sense anyway and one of them was something like um if you don't know where you're going you might end up somewhere else so uh it's a sort of like a two-part question is like and I don't even know if you can answer this um I don't want I know you don't want to step beyond the BS bounds of your knowledge but uh what you know we've talked about this before how would you describe what the awakened human looks like um in terms of how they move in the world and so on and what might be the kinds of signs of Awakening that people might look for and it's on this principle if you don't know where you're going kind of idea right like I think it is helpful and correct me anyone if I'm wrong but to have some kind of signpost is what is the natural human being looking like what is the birth of the future human or with the future human looking like yeah well I think our spiritual Traditions have been giving us uh insights into uh what's emerging I think all of the great Saints and Sages and and that were responsible for establishing or starting seeding the religions of the axial age one of the things that Drew us to them Drew Humanity to them is because we could feel a deep resonance with them and they were kind of the prototypes archetypal prototypes of what we were becoming and they invited us to become what they had become uh and in that way I think in the Buddhas and the prophets and the Christ and and the great Saints of all the deepest spiritual traditions we can see the prototypes of of what's coming so um and I the difference is I think that some people have said and I agree that the age of individual Enlightenment is over now it's Collective Enlightenment or death you know it's it's a collective game so the the the dynamic that's so unusual is uh the inti that nature seems at least in my experience Visionary experience nature seems intent on awakening the entire species to really and and the entire species is going to go through what individual Mystics have gone through in their individual Awakening the individual Mystic Goes Through The Dark Night of the Soul a period of intense purification offloading past Karma past negativity or behavior behavior on route to entering into a clear uh state of awareness which we would call Spiritual Awakening or Enlightenment or something along those lines I think Humanity as a whole is going is going through or will be going through is beginning to go through a collective dark KN of the Soul a pro a period of profound purification of confronting what we might think of as the sins of our fathers which are our sins because we are our own fathers in this way but going through a tremendous kind of purification process uh in order to clear out our basement so to speak in order to make us more receptive to uh increasing energies entering us at this from the spiritual Dimension at this time in history now another way of putting this and it ran through my sessions is I think the future human I think we're coming to a pivot point in our reincarnational story we've been reincarnating we we we die we expand to Soul we incarnate we contract into ego we expand the soul we contract into ego and we just keep this up thousands and thousands and thousands of years and we're learning and we're growing and sometimes we step back and mostly we step forward but we keep on learning and growing and Enlightenment is the Eastern Traditions have tended to see Enlightenment this culminating in Enlightenment but if we really look at what that means and uh and often they think they've tended to place it in a context you become enlightened and then you can leave uh you leave time and space you leave some Sor who wants to be in in time and space when you can be in the Bliss of Eternity but I think that's a shortsighted understanding of what's taking place now that we have a better understand understanding of how big the universe is how old it is and how complex it is it doesn't really make much sense to think that after all these hundreds of thousands of years of evolving Humanity the point of individuated Consciousness and about just 5,000 years ago Humanity begins to sink down at that depth layer where they begin to tap into that dimension of their own mind which is one with the mind of all living things uh just at that point 5,000 years afterward we've developed writing then when we achieve Spiritual Awakening then we leave we just leave it all behind I don't think that's what's happening I think now we're beginning to have a deeper understanding and that is we've been reincarnating reincarnating reincarnating and I think we are at a time when all of our former lives are beginning to come together they're they're beginning to come to us and as they come together they bring forward of course all their unfinished business which becomes our unfinished business business and this is happening collectively and when this process reaches critical stage at least it it this is how it unfolded in my session so I just I asked the listeners Indulgence there was a time when all my former lives started coming into me fast and furious and they they were fusing and I've done a lot of past life therapy work so I'm familiar with a lot of them but they were just coming in coming in and then they seemed to fuse they hit a critical mass and when they hit a critical mass there was an explosion of diamond light out of my chest and it catapulted me into a state of consciousness where I was an individual but an individual Beyond any frame of reference that I had ever imagined before and I think what I was being shown or taken into was what happens to an individual when they reach this turning point in their evolution AR Journey where all of our former lives come together Infuse and a new identity is born and this identity I think is the identity of the soul but it's not the soul that we encounter after we die it is that but it's the soul in a human incarnation in the earth in the body and this is what I call the birth of the diamond soul that is I think the future human will be a human being where the operating identity will not be any individual private identity not a 100 year old identity but it'll be a 100,000 year old identity we will have a sense of ourselves a living conscious memory of ourselves as a being that's been living in and out of time for thousands and thousands of years and a as and a being who is just large larger has has a deeper sense of themselves a deeper sense of relationships with other human beings because if they remember their former lives they remember their relationships that they're they were all involved in and as we have been male female uh wouldve been every race imaginable every religion imaginable and all of these differences are coming together and fusing to produce an individuality that holds all of that as an integrated harmonious Singularity okay that I think is is the best take I have on the future human and I can tell you that when I was taken at the toward the end of my Journeys into the deep time and was given the grace of experiencing the this new archetype this future human it just it moved me to tears it was so beautiful I mean picture a Humanity completely healed of all the wounds of History completely healed of all the divisions that we've etched in history a Humanity with an open expansive Compassionate Heart Like The Best of the Saints through history a Humanity with their Consciousness open into deep communion with the creative intelligence of the universe with fewer interfering BAU Echoes shadows in the in the way and a human being who is deeply committed to being in the body not trying to get out of time and space but living increasingly strong focused intentional life an integration of spirit and matter inside their physical existence wow that's that's kind of theit that's what has been coming into me that's what I have to offer that was absolutely beautiful Chris you know um I I think I'm G to um play this back to myself with headphones on just before bedtime for a beautiful bedtime story um and before are beautiful story we really are it is extraordinary Hard Times ahead but deep Deep Beauty coming us we need that kind of encouragement uh Chris this is such a gift that you offer to people you know um uh it puts me in mind of something um Bishop Desmond Tutu once said that is um the problem with most people is they don't believe in the possibility of possibility we need people to take heart uh we need people to believe that what they do as you say matters more than ever right yeah anyway I'm guessing um Mark you'd like to open it up to some questions yeah and just a second I just wanted to add to that because I believe that you know as human beings we can do so much more than that we think we can do do we have such an ability to push through to persevere to you know I don't mean work hard as in you know crazy but we can do more than we think we can do and it's by pushing that limit by pushing ourselves is you know how we build the muscles you don't go to the gym build muscle you know light and few reps you've got to push through the the pain and you know the challenging the things that are making it big and I think it's something that you know in some cases and I can speak for myself personally that we sometimes get a little soft you know and to remember that we have the ability to be able to have that strength to push through so before we we we go to to um questions I have one question that some people may be thinking I don't know if anybody will ask and I know I've asked this question of you before Chris um but you youve done such an amazing work on 72 high does Journeys and as a professor of religious studies most people would think that's not what a professor of religious studies would be doing because you know the stigma of what LSD might be seen as yeah what made you what inspired you to choose that direction or that path for this deep dive philosophical work work and what would you say to anybody who after hearing what you've done and experienced is there anything that you would say to them in terms of um you know some Sage advice starting at the end my advice is please don't do it please don't do it the way I did it I was young and foolish I know I understand much more now than I did then I would advise a different protocol but how I got into this is a simple story I came out of graduate school kind of an atheistically inclined agnostic in philosophy of religion but i' had a long lifelong passionate desire to ask the big questions and to seek the big answers I mean I really wanted to understand how life Works what's going on what's why is life filled with so much suffering what's is there an intelligence inside the universe expressing itself I really wanted to answer those questions if I could and right after I finished graduate school I met the work of Stan gr and his book Realms of the human unconscious changed my life and very quickly was followed in 1980 by his manual LSD Psychotherapy and I just I knew I wanted I wanted to do this work I needed to do this work I don't like breaking the law but I would I went underground basically in part of the transitional underground generation that did this work and I started doing the high dose work first as a matter of efficiency that is I was still thinking it was a personal model and uh I knew the sessions would be more intense but it would turn up more of the the my psyche and I would if I could manage the intensity I would clean up my [ __ ] faster and I'd get to Enlightenment faster turns out all my assumptions were wrong is not about personal and and when you work with high high doses you activate a larger piece of the fabric of existence and your what may begin as your individual transformational process becomes part and parcel of Humanity's larger AR Collective transformational process uh but then when when I began to understand some of this three or four years into the process I found that I had developed a taste for working with high doses I was a my Constitution was wired such that I seem to have the ability to get very large and spacious and very importantly I had the ability to contract safely at the end and this is you know not everybody you know a lot of people shouldn't work with psychedelics at all and a lot of people should not work with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD so this is you know and I would do it differently even if you have a natural AP itude even if you have the capacity even if you have the strong social setting that supports you in this work I would be much gentler I would be a gent take a gentler weigh in I'd work with more lower doses I would balance the occasional high dose with integrating lower doses I'd work with not only LSD but i' balance it with working with psilocybin or iasa uh the the vegetative psychedelics uh so there's just a lot of things I I would do differently yeah but but um uh you know you can't answer this question of course because it's the road not taken but you know just speculatively would you have been able to um bring back such deep and Powerful information had you not put yourself through this fire uh it it it I found that it takes a lot of work work and a lot of discipline uh in order when you go very deep in the universe and you transcend so many levels of time and space and identity and species identity and into archetypal and Beyond archetypal reality you're breaking into so many layers of new territory that uh it's very hard to stay conscious at those levels and often will people will only bring back pieces but if you work consistently and with discipline you can learn how to stay conscious at those levels and you can bring back more and more but it's a discipline it's it really for me it's a philosophical discipline to really not only engage and break into new territory but to bring the experiences back and and get them down in writing or art or music different people in different modalities but to bring them inside one's being to learn to live by the insights that they give you uh so I I may not have gone out as far as I ended up going out uh but I also learned that going out is not everything that I thought it was going to be in the early stages I thought that the farther out you went the more profound the impact would have and allow you to hold and change your life and you'd become an enlightened being and um and so depth was related to if you did it right was related to stabilizing the impact of these deep immersions what I learned is that it's a much more complicated process than I had initially thought the process of retaining and holding on to those experiences is much bigger than simply remembering them uh to integrate a journey is different than integrating individual sessions uh and I found that the Tas task of integrating such a radical Journey it will take me lifetimes I think to integrate where I went and and I I don't think I could ever integrate them in that sense of being able to hold them enter them uh live from them uh during my current lifetime this just the universe is too big and it took me in too deeply uh to sort of hold it well I thank you deeply uh for having done that work for us anyway I know you didn't start out to do it for Quote us but it turned out that way turned out that way yeah I I like the comment on efficiency so uh we have a comment here in the chat Melanie white says thank you Chris she loved the book LSD in the mind of the universe and thank you for sharing your insights with us tonight uh and I think that'd be a great segue um for those of you watching online maybe just the live streams after the factor or even live right now we have a studio audience here in our Zoom where we're going to take some questions we do have a question here from Jacob uh Michael if you can bring Jacob in we'll unmute him and uh we'll hear what he has to ask welcome to the program Jacob thanks for for joining us and asking a question yeah thank you uh it's going to be my first Spirit PL medicine conference this year so very exciting to kind of join you beforehand um I was deeply struck by the book Christopher and it articulated a process that I seem to find myself in some of the early stages of um not to presuppose that it would go in the same direction but um certainly I'd never encountered anybody who had been dropping into those itive levels um and yeah much much more to say about the richness of of the work but the the question I wanted to put to you is really um whether you'd really encountered like how does this process and journey for you relate to christology or did you have kind of Christ Avatar experiences and how does that kind of map onto the process for you yeah interesting question Jacob um there have been two religious Traditions or spiritual Traditions that have had the largest influence on my life the first was Christianity and the second is Buddhism and I also taught world religions for decades and so I I spent semester after semester going around the planet in my mind with my students doing a hou you know Houston Smith kind of Journey in and out of the world religions and I they just all became they became passionate lovers for me and each one of them taught me so much and while I started in a sense within the Christian framework uh I also began to understand over time that Christ is the the fruition of a spiritual impulse in the Middle East that parallels in certain seminal ways way the fruition of the spiritual impulse in India the fruition in Africa the fruition in uh in South America that I began to see larger patterns so for me if christology is the study of the Christ archetype for me that archetype is bigger than Jesus but it kind of It's a larger Dynamic of profound Prof Awakening of the human heart profound Awakening of the of of the mind of the Spirit uh so I just kind of I live and breathe in in kind of the Universalist Waters which on the one hand recognizes the distinctness of each of the lineages but also uh recognize the the overlapping Common Ground now uh I you know I didn't have a lot of experiences of of Avatar kind of beings or Angelic beings or even Spirit guides uh I didn't have um you know the machine elves encountered that people sometimes do with DMT and I didn't have a lot of experience of individuated beings in my journey and I know that a lot of people do and so I don't question that there the universe is filled with beings that we often encounter in psychedelic sessions my sense is that the nature of the work I did my sense is that maybe this is a hypothesis you have to be a being to experience beings you have to be a self to experience sells in the universe and if your work grinds you fine just grinds you repeatedly into dust then when that dust goes out into the universe it sort of takes you into the fabric of life rather than putting you into individual dialogue with individual pieces of life even deeply spiritual large pieces of life so it I was drawn into archetypal Dynamics archetypal Dimensions I was drawn into and I always was in there was a Consciousness guiding my sessions I always felt in the hands of of some a massive Consciousness but this Consciousness never appeared to me in any kind of concrete physicalist type of form I felt it as a presence it guided me deeper and deeper and deeper it it was open-ended and infinite but it didn't distill itself into particular forms so was that you see how that kind of gets complicated around christology one hand it affirms the Deep essence of it and on the other hand it uh it doesn't get concretized into our historically specific Expressions you see yeah was there a visual component to these Journeys uh very strong visual components uh not hallucinatory I mean I could pull off my eye shades in the middle of the journey and I was not hallucinating but very very deep visual components yes uh but I never saw the intelligence that I was experiencing so intimately I mean this intelligence would draw me into it would Purify Me and beat me up and crush me and and destroy me again and again and then when I'd gone through the the purification process it would receive me and take me and educate me and take me through things over and over again until it was sure that I understood what it wanted me to to know and then it would take me on deeper but it never adopted a form that I could identify as such well thank much could I do a brief brief followup question sure nobody else has their hands up so go for it cool um your work also resonated a lot for me with that of Pier Tad jadan and I wondered if your like to what how did how do you feel his work kind of mapping with your sense of this kind of as an epocal birth period um yeah just assuming you're familiar with his his writings and isn't it striking the overlap uh I mean really the profound insights that he had to humanity coming to a turning point and the News sphere and uh you know he was trained as a geologist and so he had this large his historical landscape uh and with his deep natural spirituality uh and his deep Christian faith he saw so much uh and I I think there is an overlap uh and I had read you know shardan uh in graduate school and I had read many spiritual teachers and and many but uh I don't think they I mean just a sort of anticipate a question that some readers might have I don't think it shaped my experience of what actually happened in the session uh it it helped me understand and interpret what happened in the sessions but the sessions had their own generative power which seemed to be drawing from a different kind of source but that sardan saw as much as he sell all on his own in his you know non-amplified capacity just awesome just awesome yeah well thank you so much for the question Jacob and if anybody else has uh any questions for Chris now is the time if you want to raise your digital can turn turn your camera on we'd be happy to take your question looks like we're good or you can raise your physical hand oh there we go Jackie H are you good there we go we'll ask you to unmute here awesome hi Chris hi Jackie I one um so this is maybe like you would said in terms of like the movement of the planet and all the urgency and what direction we move into that there are people better suited maybe to fill in the details but I'm thinking about like what are the things that might be happening now in terms of accelerating shifts in Consciousness um like are there things is are psychedelics part of that you know Steph's book can psychedelics help change the world um how do we stabilize those things and I'm I'm thinking about like I know there are groups of meditators deep meditators for example who are working with lowd do 5 Meo as a kind of uh Ally for achieving nature of mind uh meditation or a kind of idea that somehow these excursions can help us restructure so that we can contain more or have more capacity for these shifts in Consciousness um um so I'm just curious your thoughts on that like not that I know of course you can't Advocate that everybody go do psychedelics but just what your thoughts are like if you had a workshop what would you train people to do well first I just want a big yes to everything you're saying uh I think we're all hardwired into the collective psyche I mean it's we are truly embedded our individual life is a cell within the life of our species physically at a physical biological level and also at a at a mental level spiritual level so everything we do registers in the collective psyche and the collective psyche shapes everything that we do I mean it it creates the structures in the territory uh so in an extreme example is I think when I die I take my psychedelic experiences with me but I also think that the spe species mind will keeps it too because I I was a human being when I had these experiences so they become part of the human family of experience and therefore they continue to even if I never reincarnate it again these experiences would be alive within the human family and this is true for all of us everything we're doing continues to live so the the harm that we bring into life registers in the Human family the healing that we bring into life the insights that we bring the care and compassion that we bring all kind of Infuse the network of life that is the Human family and and Beyond the Human family so yeah I think that when we work uh as the spiritual Traditions tell us there is no such thing as private spiritual practice so you know the first thing you do in in Buddhist tradition when you do a practice is you cultivate bodh or the desire to save or to in to help all sentient beings and the last thing you do at the end of the practice is you distribute the Merit to all levels of being all six levels of the BAU to all levels so you're constantly the the the Trap that we can get caught in is to think that it's all about some personal Enlightenment or personal exercise and the spiritual Traditions are telling us just the opposite it's not about you dummy it's it's all of us you know it's all all of us so open your heart open your mind let the pain in bring the healing out uh and when we do that I think we can just trust that everything we're doing is being conserved and used by the other beings who are alive at this point in time in fact that's one of the things I'm going to be talking about at the conference because in my life I was an academic I had to keep all this work completely hidden I never let my students knew know what I was doing I was always you know that was a private part of my life but I found that my students began to be activated by my psychedelic work and they there was a certain transparency opening between their mind and my mind and I began to understand it was as if my students were showing me that what I had experienced about the nature of Consciousness that ultimately it's all one integrated consciousness it was as if what was happening in my classroom was demonstrating that this is true and eventually it forced me to to learn an entirely new way of teaching that was respectful of these Quantum fields that were emerging in our work together so there is no such thing as private practice there is no such thing you know we're all in this together we're arm in- arm everything we do serves uh everyone in the process beautiful yeah thank you thank you for that question Jackie was coming in from Philadelphia it's really great to see people coming in from different parts of the world we have uh another one person joining us from Salisbury UK uh different parts of Al well here's Albuquerque New Mexico one things albu technology all right Michael K Michael K has a question I'll unmute you here Michael there we go oh you're muted you're not at your you'll have to there you go you'll have to click the request there you are hello everyone hello yeah I'm calling from uh lake Lake Geneva Wisconsin and uh Chris I wanted to focus on your experience in the collective of the human species yeah and relating that to uh individual efforts today and you mentioned that you carry hope for the future you you were that we will come through this birth process but could you expand a little bit more on the relationship between the individual and Collective and do with what you just said uh in the final comments on the last question do you think that the right inspiration from the right individual will spread much faster in the future into the collective Consciousness with acceptance far faster than it has been in the past yeah Welly if we if we just look at what's going on around us right now you know America is in a a presidential election and we see a deeply divided country and we couldn't have candidates more Polar Opposites than the than the candidates we have and such deep um polarization of political of the political spectrum and we see this in so many different areas of discourse so it is ex we're in very turbulent choppy uncertain times uh and I it's not just uh the truth that catalyzes connections with greater truth but also lying catalyzes lying you know and Darkness catalyzes Darkness so the collective this dynamic between the individual and the collective is not simply a sunny side of the street Dynamic it also applies to the darker side of the street and we see this in in shamanic culture CES where they are dealing not just with healing but they're also dealing with dark Forces and um managing them or controlling them I think however that Carl Young is right that uh nature tilts towards growth I think it tilts towards us becoming more than we are larger than we are wiser than we are more intelligent than we are nature tilt towards growth and I think that if nature is trying to bring about this pivot towards this higher form of Consciousness emerging even though we are experiencing tremendous upheaval from the at the collective level politically socially uh culturally I think the deeper movement is towards higher better truer clearer uh better good more good and so I think that um if nature favors growth that individuals who have made the transition in their own being that humanity is trying to make collectively I think of those individuals as becoming kind of seed Catalyst their very presence helps catalyze what's trying to emerge out underneath our feet at a collective level so do think that individuals have tremendous power to influence not just physically not just by physical contact but all the spiritual Traditions have recognized that there is a a subtler form of influence that radiates around people when they do deep spiritual practice that's why the Chinese traditions always valued having a contemplative practicing in their Community outside of town the Christian monasteries and naries have always understood that their work their spiritual practice had had a beneficent influence on the surrounding communities so I think that's going to be increasing as we move forward beautiful great question thank you for for that Michael and I I think unless anybody else raises their hand in the next you know half a second or so um we'll we'll start wrapping up our program and Chris I first I want to just thank you for you know the work that you do and let you know how much I appreciate you I've got to know you over the past number of years as you've uh been a great supporter of the spe plant medicine conference and your graciousness your wisdom your energy and that of your beautiful wife Christina as well you know it's just it's so yeah beautiful to be in your presence and to hear your words and and bring take that in so I just want to let you know how grateful I am for for you and the work that you do and I'm gonna have to pay you later when you get up here Chris because you know at the beginning you said it's one of the best psychedelic conferences ever so thank you for that um which leads into a segue that that I just wanted to share with people that you know if you're here in the zoom room and you're watching and you're thinking about coming to the conference or you're not sure or you're watching online one of the things that we do is bring in this virtual aspect so that we can be um live in person maybe not in person but we have a virtual community where you can connect with each other you can have questions and answers with the speakers uh in the room as well we bring in Chris was one of our surprise guests last year who came in um and and talked to some folks in the room and you know just have that different way of connecting and being able to participate cuz not everybody uh we understand can come and join us physically there's always limitations and time frames but if you can join us in person we'd love to see you there and we love to see you uh in the virtual room and the bonus of the virtual stuff too is you get replays and you can come back into the membership and you can catch up on it instead of just getting that one hit from the room in in a physical presence so thank you so much for for your work Chris I really appreciate the support of you and and your beautiful wife uh with her conference and I I got a shirt for you because I know the ones you like ah good yeah I've worn the other ones so much they're getting worn out so a new shirt is good you know you're not the only one as a funny side note but it's true I was at the Unicorn music festival for those who don't know and John Stockton is he's a beautiful soul and he's a lawyer from the days of cannabis and everything else and I had seen him for a while and he comes up to our our our tent and stuff at the at the conference and he's wearing the same shirt the the Green Tree shirt and like you said Chris it was all worn out he loved it it was one of his favorite shirts so he had to set them up with another one just a funny story as a as a sidebar for for that um but if there's anything that you want to add Stephen or Chris before we uh wrap it up that would be great well um uh excuse me um I'm assuming you'll say a little bit more about ways that people can join the conference Mark um but also um uh I have a particular question for a friend of mine who lives in Switzerland and wanted to uh catch this interview um but it'll be 2 am there right now or when it's started and so uh how can he see this later because um and the other thing I want to say to anyone who's still with us now um plus anyone who sees this later is uh if you if you heard the things that Chris say said today along with perhaps other information that he has shared this is absolutely important for our planet right now to hear these things that Chris is saying absolutely Central and um at the very least I mean you know the Basic Ground of that in a sense is the encouragement and sort of uplifting that's going to be needed as we go through these you know increasingly challenging times on the material Level I mean there's going to be no doubt you know what's already happened and will increase further is deeper levels of anxiety and depression and confusion and tendencies to grasp onto um you know unreasonable hopes such as you know what's going on in the Maga movement for example etc etc so I my my dream My Hope Is that thousands and thousands of people will watch this interview and so starting with my friend Craig in Switzerland how can he tune into it Mark well what a great question Stephen thanks for asking it's really simple first off uh for anybody who signed up we're going to send out an an email um with the link direct link but you can check out our spirit plant medicine uh YouTube channel it's streaming there live as we speak uh you can check out our Facebook page uh as well it's streaming live there as we speak and so they're always there for replays after the fact and if you're inspired or moved by what you're hearing please please share it with your friends share it far and wide and that helps the algorithms as well in the social media platforms to um you know start showing it more and more so it's really important that if there's something here that moved you please you know find those and share them uh far and wi so it's easy to find and we'll send out some email reminders so and I would like to put in one final pitch for people to attend the conference because of the again the kinds of things that Chris has been sharing is that we are moving into to a collective journey and um quite honestly this is not really a sales pitch I don't see it that way it's a it's a it's a call to a gathering um I've been I've been tending to think of the conference as an empowerment Hub now that uh we can support and Empower and encourage each other by meeting whether it be you know they can only make it virtually um or even better of course in person um it's it's it's part of the collective Journey that we're working with here yeah yeah if I can jump in and just put another heartfelt plug for the conference because I mean truly I just love going to the conference it's an intimate conference uh it's not like God bless Maps you know but it's not like the 13,000 me mega conferences this is a a group of dedicated practitioners working with many therapeutic modalities with many substances as opportunities for uh conversations and a lot of new things get open there I release diamonds LSD in the mind of the universe in 2019 I think it was right we got it early released there uh and now at this conference I'm going to be releasing as part of my presentation the new edition of the living classroom which is the first time that I'm able to really tell the story of the role of psychedelics that psychedelic played in the the ideas that I wrote about in the original version of 2000 in of the living classroom in 2008 where I thought it was best to keep psychedelics out of the story so there's just there's new material that comes forward new ideas and there's just nothing like the contagious quality of being in the room with like-minded people and the interactions and exchanges that take place it's just it's just really a wonderful Wonder ful place to be hey Chris have you been talking to um Colin at all about getting that book in time for the conference yes uh oh good I think we're going to have it in time it's going to be an Advan release uh I don't know whether we'll have the paperback I don't think the paperback is going to be out and so that means it's going to be a bit pricey uh because it'll be the hard back you know and it's Sunni press State University of New York Press and uh but yeah we will have copies there I wish we were going to have the paperback but that won't be out for another year hey Mark maybe we could um offer um a slight special discount ticket price if they uh purchase the book at the same time well that that's a good one I'm not sure how I would uh rip that out of my mind right now I want to warn you it it's a pricey I don't remember exactly what it is but it's it's aimed at libraries you know the the hard always is yeah who's theer we'll definitely share it share it out there far and wide for those interested um as as well through our community and you know it's thank you for your kind words Chris and it is the the let me just get the marbles out of my mouth it's not really a conference we just call it a conference it's a ceremony and then we kind of put a conference inside of it right so um the it certainly is is a communitybased gathering and you know I'm blessed to be here today at the I am awake foundation and this is a story about um Chris and JY and the work that they're doing in Consciousness research and exploration and they met at the spe plant medicine conference in 2019 and their work Grew From there so they've been doing this beautiful work for five years we've met so many people who have met and you know created relationships and you know doing business and working together and just connecting that that we've seen is is a great connecting opportunity and even if you're not in person you still have that ability uh in the virtual world as well because you have the ability to connect and chat like-minded people so if you're interested by all means please join us there's many ways to do so and we'd love to see you there whether virtually uh and of course in person there's always room so uh that being said I just want to thank you again Chris for the work you do I look forward to seeing you and Christina again in in the very near future and Stephen thank you as well for being my partner and co-host and everything that we do together it's always always a pleasure and I also want to give a big shout out to Michael Krauss who is behind the scenes he's uh just a beautiful soul who does a lot of great work with UniFi the world peace movement and and many many different things regarding spirituality there he is there Michael thank you for your support always as we do these programs so we can do can can I I can't raise my hand because of the technology behind it um well you've got you've got all the power really man so I know I know I know and and I just wanted to deeply deeply express my gratitude to you specifically Chris um for your wisdom for your knowledge and having done the work for all of us and and what I really got from you and and and really feeling into your energy and you said presence earlier on is where you've arrived in that deepest deepest level of the of the gentleness of your heart and that to me that is what we need to cultivate across the planet if we want to move into that new transformation and I I I I would want to get emotional almost because I can I can feel the presence of you and and I I just deeply want to bow to you for your work for your wisdom for your knowledge and and and the beauty of your soul and and thank you thank you thank you and it what an honor to be um supporting this through the technology here in the in the background and um and also thank you Steve and and thank you Mark the the beauty that shines through you and and the commitment mhm is is unparalled so thank you for that Michael and you know as a segue Hey Stephen next this Thursday two days from now we've got a great series coming up in in the in the next month of pre-conference events and conversations this Thursday four o'clock Marco Sanchez and aaia Lewis will be joining us and they're both absolutely brilliant they were in my humble opinion no offense to any of the other speakers last year they were the two strongest and for me personally they're both brilliant and have a lot of really relevant things to say and um hey Michael if you're still listening um lucky for you Chris has gone beyond the level of spiritual realization where he's seduced by flattery and then lastly hey next Tuesday a week from today Rick doblin from M all right way to go and then I think the following Thursday after we have um soy Keen uh soy Ken um yeah actually we have to talk about that um hey about the time let's just talk about who's joining us next Thursday and we'll talk about that no part of that Mark is we might possibly have to switch that to Wednesday uh for Anya but we'll have to talk about it um okay well next week stay tuned we got lots coming just yeah check your emails and make sure you confirm that so you get everything we'll be posting that we just want to let everybody know so with that being said I just want to wrap up with a nice little closing for conscious living on Co-op radio my name is Mark Kuran joined by Steven Gray and our special guest Chris bash here on 100.5 cfro FM in Vancouver until next time take care of each other thank you he

      <p>and all of a sudden my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and I saw reality far far in the distance again it looked kind of like galaxies and out of that reality a beam of light came and hit me and it absolutely shattered me it just it was a more powerful light than even the diamond Luminosity that had become my Ultimate Reality 50 high-dose sessions in and just in that one second it completely changed my understanding of reality thank you Chris thank you for being willing to hop on with me glad to be here today Luke cool everyone this is Christopher mbaish he's a PhD and Professor uh Emeritus in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Youngstown State University where he taught for 33 years an award-winning teacher an international speaker Chris's work explores the philosophy philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of Consciousness especially psychedelic States and today we'll be primarily discussing ideas related to his book LSD and the mind of the universe uh his story of 20 years of his journey into the mind of the universe through 73 high-dose sessions of LSD welcome Chris thank you Luke it's good to be here with you awesome so um I thought I'd figure it I'd start by just sort of tracing the path that a lot of people may explore with psychedelics first being that the first encounter people may have at least now uh today is they may encounter psychedelics for for biohacking or for productivity say with like micro dosing and then once they've experienced that maybe they'll discover the therapeutic power of psychedelics and then in those therapeutic Journeys maybe they'll discover that psychedelics are powerful tools for Spiritual Awakening but there's a level even deeper than the level of Spiritual Awakening and it's a path that that you took could you tell us about that well that path I call cosmological exploration and it's a path which clearly overlaps with the healing capacity of psychedelics and the spiritual awakening capacity but it's different uh I think the spiritual awakening basically invites us to clean our Consciousness and clean our system in a way that allows us to abide more comfortably and consistently in a transparent condition transparent to what the Buddhists would call one's essential nature one's Buddha nature or other Traditions would call once divine nature cosmological exploration is different than that it really is seeking to explore the Deep structure of Consciousness and the Deep structure of the universe to basically understand at a deeper philosophical level how reality works why are things the way they are what are some of the deep structures of cosmic reality awesome and I'd love to ask you more in a bit about reality itself and and those and those layers um but could you tell us a bit more just about what the path uh the the sort of protocol you followed and what that path looked like as he went along well I was just out of graduate school back in ancient history in 1978 and I read Stan Groff's first book Realms of the human unconscious which had been published in 76 and immediately I recognized the significance of Stan's work for my discipline which is philosophy of religion I'm not a psychologist not a therapist I've never been particularly interested in the therapeutic applications as Stan has but I'm really have been interested in its philosophical applications so recognizing kind of a call I began my work which ended up lasting 20 years I did four years of very intense work I stopped for six years and then I followed that with 10 years of very intense work I chose to work with high doses of LSD and by high doses I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms this is a regimen that I don't recommend today I seriously don't recommend and if I were doing it over again I would do it differently I would be much gentler use lower Doses and a wider distribution a wider spectrum of psychedelics but I chose to work with high doses of LSD for a couple of reasons one's first LSD that was the substance that Stan had done most of his research on and I trusted that research uh and again this was 1978 so this is pre-ayahuasca pre some of the early appreciation of uh organic and shamanic traditional organic psychedelics used by shamanic traditions and I I worked with high doses because I was still thinking within a model of personal transformation our personal Spiritual Awakening and the spiritual traditions basically taught that our karma is finite and if I understood LST Psychotherapy as a process of cleaning up one's Karma so to speak you know basically unearthing problematic material from one's personal unconscious and clearing that material I thought by working with high doses I could basically clear up my karma in a fewer number of sessions essentially taking a bigger bite out of the Apple in every session turns out that that assumption was completely wrong because [Music] the assumption that that the human psyche that this process was primarily focused on human transformation was a mistake of personal transformation the collective dimensions of the psyche surface in my work very quickly on after just a couple of years and the broader ramifications of entering into communion with the Universe At Large presented itself soon thereafter um so what I basically did I worked in therapeutic protocol stands therapeutic protocol outlined in his book LSD psychotherapy which means working in total isolation with a sitter lying down eye shades headphones carefully curated playlists of Music staying internalized all day long I would work in the early morning through to evening staying internalized in the session and then making detailed records of my experiences the day after so that was the that was the protocol got it awesome and of course reading the book I uh know a little bit about uh where where that went in the end um but I'm curious so I know in another interview you mentioned that you had um uh since partaken in uh so sibden in Ayahuasca um Journeys um and at one point in the book you mentioned that one of the advantages of LSD being sort of a longer acting substance around eight hour Journeys that it kind of Buffs the diamond more in that time so to speak um uh I know there are other psychedelics that are now uh entering the potential use for people in in society um and ibogain is one substance that has a very long active time about like 24 to 48 hours um and we could contrast that with like five Meo DMT which is an active period of like 15 20 minutes something like that um would ibogaine potentially be a better Contender for that reason if not for cosmological exploration but for Spiritual Awakening and what might the protocol look like if you were to use something like 5mu DMT well first of all I've never used ibogains and so I'm not really qualified to speak to that in terms of comparing its function our values just looking at the window issue there are other issues with psychedelics every psychedelic has a mind amplifying quality but the texture or the Nuance the way it opens Consciousness the spectrum of Consciousness that it opens us into varies from psychedelic to psychedelic but just looking at the window the reason I think the window is significant and this is basically reflecting on people's experiences with DMT initially which is a relatively short-acting psychedelic and Rick Strassman in his book DMT The Spirit Molecule basically found that his his clients were not really changed very deeply by very having very significant DMT experiences and in looking at his experiences and his data comparing it to my data I think what happens is you know in order to explore the universe you're you're going you're using your small mind to explore big mind you're using your individual personal Consciousness to explore this vast field of consciousness and when you have a Long window it gets more time for the large field to interact with the smallest field and do the cleansing and purification that's needed in order to have deep experiences of this Cosmic reality if you have a only a very short acting psychedelic you don't have much time for the large Consciousness to impact and be absorbed by the smaller Consciousness which means it has less of an of an activating effect less of a transformative effect there are other variables of course in the psychopharmacology of psychedelics but just the window is I think of an interesting variation short-acting psychedelics have been like five Meo are it's a remarkable psychedelic uh it gives us quick access if you use it in high doses to very deep Cosmic realities uh but our time there is short uh um again I'm I don't have a lot of experience with 5meo and I certainly don't work with it clinically with other people I've talked with a number of therapists who work with 5meo at different levels of intensity for working with clients I know it has remarkable transformative value but I not really too comfortably comparing it's transformative potential with the transformative potential of LSD other than to make this simple relation between a Time window and opportunity for transformation got it awesome thank you yeah and one of the things that stood out about the book was how very um not exaggerated you know what I mean like it isn't you you don't necessarily go too far from The Experience itself um and maybe that's your inclination as a philosopher and academic but I really appreciate that so I really I tried to just truly it's a huge challenge of course to try to document or to present 20 years of such dramatic experiences so the choice I made was really try to keep close to the phenomenology keep close to the experiences because the experiences were to me much more valuable than anything I would say about them any interpretation I might offer just the raw experiences themselves got it so um I got a question now you don't recommend that people do what you did and reading the book initially I was feeling inspired I was seeing your courage I thought wow this is amazing maybe this is something I could explore by the end that sort of shifted um but overall psychedelic psychedelic use for Spiritual Awakening is bit like basically inevitable at this point at least for many people in society um so for someone who might use psychedelics for Spiritual Awakening not necessarily cosmological exploration what might you recommend as a protocol or structure for people who want to do like a slower psychedelic path and how might that integrate with the Slow Burn traditions well I'll make a suggestion but again I want to emphasize that I'm not a clinician I don't work I don't have a history of working with other people I basically have made a self-conscious choice not to work with other people but to be simply a solitary Explorer pushing my system hard making basically a map of the dimensions that I entered into but I don't that doesn't give me a lot of experience working with other people to answer your question but basically as I've read the literature and processed my own experience for Spiritual Awakening I would recommend uh very low doses because basically Spiritual Awakening is about dissolving the glue that holds the ego in place is dissolving the structures that keep us fixed in these repetitive patterns of thoughts and emotions uh and so you've got to kind of ferret out the ego where it lives in the world and I think this has done well with low doses of LSD um low doses of LSD combined with a sustained meditative practice once in a while doing more in order to challenge the boundaries of Consciousness but basically if the goal is spiritual awakening I think low doses of a psychedelic would be the way to go cool awesome awesome thank you for that um something that was interesting that uh I think some people do get a sense of from their own Journeys whether or not they've had just a few over time is there there seems to be a kind of uh effect of having just the right amount of experience as they needed at the time in that Journey you experienced something similar in in your Journeys in your book could you tell us about like that sense of guidance well um in all of my work I always felt myself engaging and being engaged by a larger consciousness this Consciousness did not take concrete form it never took personified form it never took concretized form and it changed are the qualities of this Consciousness changed the deeper I went so that I began to understand the way I think of it is the Consciousness that we enter into communion with in psychedelic States is an infinite Consciousness that's capable of generating any number of different types of experiences or types of awareness within us and our mind acts as a seed Catalyst a seed Crystal that catalyzes a certain set of experiences from this infinite consciousness [Music] um if you do this repetitively over repeatedly the experiences that you have and you integrate internalize and go through the various purification processes it changes your your Consciousness and therefore the Consciousness that you take into the next encounter is a different Consciousness that catalyzes a deeper set of experiences from the infinite potential of consciousness and that means that the what you experience as this guiding intelligence the this massive intelligence that you meet at different levels is in a way uh a Consciousness that arises at the intersection between your individual mind and this universal mind and as you change the intersection changes um so that from my experience the Consciousness which I felt was always guiding my sessions uh was always invisible to me but was always felt it didn't adopt concrete form or at very seldom adopt concrete form because the form would change as the experiences deepens so it you know that formless quality as I say think something innate to do with the Consciousness itself and then in going beyond the collective level of Consciousness between beyond the collective psyche and even Beyond human history when you're pushing so deep you're going Beyond Jung's category of archetypal Consciousness you're letting you're going Beyond human history altogether all of the interpretive Frameworks all the images all the concepts that we associate with our religious and spiritual history they just fall away uh basically if several thousand years or five or ten thousand years of religious history just fall away and you're moving into States Of Consciousness that go beyond any category of gods or deities or Angelic beings you're in a completely different world uh so yes always guidance um always an intelligence engaging me but formless yeah yeah amazing amazing um I have yet to get to that level in my particular Journeys but perhaps someday um and uh I'd like to ask more specifically about sort of the forms that can appear partly because I know from YouTube A lot of people are searching that I can see the analytics that entity encounters is a very popular and interesting point of conversation um and you mentioned you you explored a little bit uh more in the book um and you speak about how devotion is related to these entities um but let me ask this like a guy I was speaking to at integration Circle um in Victoria here uh not too long ago he mentioned he had a mystical experience where he encountered none other than Ganesh the elephant God of Hinduism and when people have these encounters they may ask a question that you asked in your Journeys which was you know what is the meaning of what I experienced um so what for after your Journeys how would you reflect on sort of the meaning of encountering say a particular form of a deity or something like that no first of all let me qualify I don't consider my experiences normative you know in any generalizable way you know there are so many different medicines so many different ways of using those medicines and so many different personalities that are using the medicines to engage this infinite depth of Consciousness that it would be foolish to think that any one person their experience would be a map or chart for other people's experiences so I just I begin my position is to be very interested in other people's experiences in a very non-judgmental and supportive way so whatever I say here please take it in that context when we experience realities that are Beyond us or Consciousness dimensions of Consciousness that are beyond our own and when we're tapping into those qualities that are like infinite compassion and infinite intelligence and infinite creativity these are qualities that we tend to associate historically with various deities and it's not surprising that our mind would put together the qualities of the phenomenology of the experience with the qualities of the deities which we may or may may have had experience exposure to intellectually and sometimes we counter deities that we haven't they're not part of our own personal lineage and may not have been part of our um they may not have been something even that we knew about it comes completely out of left field and yet it Bears the form of a culture's form of this deity like Ganesh or Jesus or Mary or the prophet Muhammad or something like that so my understanding of it is that when you are working or when you are engaging entities are forms that have this quality of an entity that is identifiable in our historical Traditions my sense is that we are engaging a collective thought form or a spiritual being that is wearing the clothes of a collective thought form and by a collective thought form I mean if you have millions and millions of devotees that meditate and pray and offer devotions to a particular deity form which has been identified in their scripture which is painted in their culture statuary is all of this form if you have millions and millions and millions of being over thousands of years in devotional attachment to these forms or devotional focus on these forms I think it creates a certain structure in the collective psyche a collective thought form and I don't minimize those forms I think they're extraordinarily powerful including secular thought Farms like greed power anger those you know very powerful in our system so when we encounter the deity in a or a deity in a in a particular form we are either encountering a spiritual principle which is beyond form which is wearing the form of this Collective garment or we're experiencing the collective garments straight out in itself either way the collective psyche is implicated the collective psyche is part of our experience which is all perfectly normal and perfectly well and good I think um at the same time I would hold out that it is possible to go beyond all Collective thought forms and to go beyond human history in one's experience and when one does those forms tend to fade away I know there's a lot of discussion of entities because particularly DMT and DMT derivatives often expose people to entities and I'm not suggesting that those entities aren't real or the entities don't exist but to me personally and again limitations but personally those entities reflect different levels of reality that as you go deeper those levels that that kind of granular quality of lots of individual beings tends to yield to levels of reality which are less granular fewer individual beings kind of constituting the population of those levels of reality and opening up into vast Tracks Of Consciousness which are less individual less entity-like it at least it is in my experience got it awesome totally yeah that that definitely seems to resonate um in terms of it being sort of a matter of levels um and uh after seeing sort of where you go in those levels it makes a lot more sense that at some point even though it's dissolve and becomes something different um um so uh speaking of levels um you mentioned uh that there's sort of a transition that you make and relatively quickly I think you said two years which for a young person maybe that's a lot um um and that one of the transitions that happens is a a sense of the journey sort of being about yourself to being to be about the individual to being about the collective um and you speak about uh well I'll speak about it um and uh part of that transition certain things became obvious to you um and one of those being uh the the sort of fact of of reincarnation and past lives um and I'm curious uh could you let us know sort of what the different levels were and how your experience changed as you went up or deeper into them all right those are sort of two questions rolled into one so let me take the one on reincarnation first and then bring me back if I don't come back to the first question bring me back to it got it um when I finished graduate school and was beginning my academic life two people's work changed my life one was Stan Groff and that's what we're talking about today the other person whose work changed my life with Ian Stevenson professor at the University of Virginia who is the Charles Darwin of reincarnation and he basically has generated the data he's Tracked Down the data small children who have spontaneous recall of their former lives insufficient detail uh and that we can basically exclude natural or physical explanations for how they would have these memories and he's done this in book after book after book so Stevenson convinced me that reincarnation was a fact of life and he convinced me before I was really very deeply involved in my psychedelic work but that concept was affirmed and expounded and deepened as my psychedelic worked deep and so it was already part of my intellectual Furniture but it just I began to understand it more and more deeply as we went now in terms of levels again I was working at very high dose levels so you can count it in terms of years or you can count it in terms of sessions it took me about 10 sessions to go through what Stan calls the perinatal level of Consciousness which is that level of Consciousness which is at right at the interface between personal Consciousness and transpersonal Consciousness where they overlap is this level which is at the one hand the basement of the personal psyche and the doorway into spiritual reality so that one goes through many experiences of death experiences of sometimes reliving your own birth confronting all your anxiety about whether there's anything good in reality Beyond physical existence tremendous existential pain quandary and eventually this culminates in ego death and so the eagle is shattered and you're transcended you move into levels of consciousness that go considerably beyond anything that could be explained in terms of your personal history it was at that point when I was expecting actually to be get granted um more comfortable access to spiritual reality what I found was that the entire death rebirth cycle repeated itself again but this time at a completely different level I began to have tremendous Collective experiences experiencing Collective rage Collective anguish for a long this went on for another two years and another 10 or so sessions to another 12 sessions in the beginning I thought this was simply another variation a deepening of ego death I was still thinking in terms of a personal model I thought that somehow this Collective ego death this Collective death represented a deepening of my personal death but in time it went on for so long and it lasted for it was so the content of the experiences was so inherently connect Collective that eventually I came to a different conclusion and that is the conclusion I came to is that the patient in these sessions wasn't me personally but in some way the patient had become my human family the collective species of humanity and that I was being drawn into um Collective coex systems that held the pain and suffering of human history that just as my individual psyche collects my individual trauma in coex systems the memory of our species collects its Collective trauma in these vast Collective coex systems and I call them meta matrices so that eventually what I came to understand took me a long time because this was so Paradigm breaking and it was so foreign to and it sounded so arrogant that somehow something I was doing in my sessions was somehow impacting the in the psyche of humanity I mean my God that just looks like megalomania but it's not that it's it's simply following the natural course of the deepening of the death rebirth cycle so that it it churns at the personal level and in my case then it churned at the collective level for another two years and eventually it culminated in this orgy of of uh pain and suffering of the ocean of suffering and then it spun me into archetypal reality and the collective the ocean of suffering never returned after that point it just stopped there were still very intense purification processes to come but this particular quality of collect this Collective ordeal uh stopped and I went into a whole nother cycle of death and rebirth so yeah that's basically the the driving force behind my book dark night early Dawn is basically to understand the relationship or why why these Collective experiences were showing up in my therapy when I thought I was individual therapy what were all these people doing in my therapy turns out it wasn't that at all right that's funny oh and also uh for people who don't know uh coax system uh is termed from Stan Groff and is sort of the the collection of uh biographical traumas going down to perinatal traumas around birth and then going deeper into the transpersonal in that stack of that pattern stack with a similar feeling tone is a coax so then the Medico X's interesting concept um thank you for the clarification a system of condensed experience an aggregate that's compiled of many experiences and memories and Fantasies around a particular theme around in the individual So Meta matrices suggested the same Dynamic happens at the collective level yeah got it do you uh relate that to the idea of ancestral healing or uh maybe that's different actually than sort of like family trauma interesting uh variations on a theme aren't they both of them are trans individual ancestral still is working within the lineage of the individual some type of biographical lineage right whereas I tend to focus I mean I haven't done a lot of work with ancestors in the work that I've done so I I don't want to presume to be able to speak on that area for me very we very quickly I go into the soul reality and the soul of course jumps historical lineages all over the place the soul is we've been every race we've been every culture we've been every occupation that's available through history so to me it broadens out very quickly into the human Story the Human family but other people have had an experience of working with their personal trauma ancestral trauma you know in that kind of directed linear fashion and so yeah I think there there should be some relationship between what I experience as these meta matrices of human trauma and what other people experience as ancestral trauma Gatherings at an ancestral level yeah I wonder if maybe the difference is so the sole Capital as Soul being the collection of your the experiences of your awareness across multiple paths all your past reincarnated lifetimes I wonder if maybe the it speaks to a differentiation between like biological trauma and passed down also socially passed down from parent to child maybe that's sort of where that comes from and then the Soul is like a different thing I don't know it does that resonate with you potentially it does and I think one day we will understand this much more I mean we basically are right at the edge we're collecting the phenomenology the experiences but actually interpreting this complex new complex of experiences is going to take some time yeah got it totally um right uh interesting question so you you mentioned uh species mind and coming into this ocean of suffering of collective pain um uh where do animals fit into this yeah well of course many psychedelices have very powerful experiences with uh animal species with the various totems of various species they have powerful experiences of the planet filled with the minds of these species not just the individual species but the minds of these species and Aggregates of mammalian mind and so on and so forth um that hasn't been the thrust of my experience the thrust of my experience has really been working with human consciousness but the nature of my experience of human consciousness completely opens me to the reality of animal Consciousness and all sorts of different forms I think the reason I've been focused on human consciousness for reasons not of my choosing just kind of being driven at a deeper level is that Humanity represents the greatest danger to life on this planet we are the we are the life destroyers we are the driving force of the sixth Extinction if we can heal Humanity then all the other animals all the other mammals and life forms on the planet will be safe and that has been the focus of my work seems to have been vocally focused on that human story other people have been retrieving the Consciousness story of other life forms even Rock life forms and insect life forms and animal life forms bird fish life forms absolutely important work essential work it just hasn't been my personal work got it yeah it's very interesting um and and maybe it's uh that I I read this book um uh levels of energy by David Hawkins I don't know if you're familiar with it but the basic point is he um uses a method to uh in in his framework uh identify a number to the level of Consciousness or the level of energy of a being or an object or a mineral or whatever um and he and interesting enough uh uh like a bacteria lands on the the scale somewhere they're very low three or something I don't know um and uh I don't know what might come first is the acknowledgment of the consciousness of say animals and working our way down or the acknowledgment of say Consciousness above us but it seems either way it's sort of they they yeah make the other aware something like that let's imagine that there are as as many levels of consciousness as there are quote below us simpler and simpler and simpler know moving all the way down through the evolutionary tree imagine that there are that many levels of consciousness above us and that we're not in any way the top of the chain but we're maybe somewhere in the midpoint of that chain totally and an image comes to mind of I think you mentioned the end of the book of the idea that an Ascension of us in Consciousness is sort of like a pulling down of something from a higher level and I thought oh hey how does that work for like like our our tissue cells like if they they're sort of reliant on us in some way and we're also reliant on them and there's this like bottom-up top-down relationship yeah um but um so I'd love to ask you uh speaking about levels again I think we we touched on breaking through to archetypal uh what you you the best language that you could find being archetypal um uh reality and um something you mentioned experiencing at that jump was a shift in your sense of the the realness of everyday ordinary life and ordinary States Of Consciousness I'm curious did uh did your sense of reality change continuously did it change in certain jumps or maybe just that one jump and how did your sense of reality shift my my sense of reality changed uh repeatedly at different levels when everything was said and done when I was processing all the experiences and trying to organize them in some form to present them and share them with other people I differentiated five different levels core levels of consciousness personal mind Collective mind archetypal mine causal Oneness so the causal mind and then Diamond Luminosity overlapping levels and it's somewhat arbitrary where you draw the lines but basically those divisions so that the jump from personal Consciousness into Collective reality was a significant jump into it it's like this is how reality is organized at a higher altitude right and then when that culminated and I was spun into reality into Arc what I called archetypal reality this was a Quantum step into a still deeper modality of consciousness and in this one of the Striking features was I repeatedly had the sense over this next year and a half of work that I had entered a reality that was more real then time and space and I was dealing with phenomena that were more real than my personal existence inside time and space or even time space itself and this of course touches on an ancient idea that we Trace back to Plato that there are structures he called them archetypes there are structures that in create and inform time space reality all right and he conceived these structures as Eternal ideas in the mind of an eternal unchanging ideas in the mind of an eternal deity an eternal Divine principle that's not how I experienced them I experience them as living entities as moving in time but on a completely different scale of time so an analogy that came up in my sessions if you think of the Earth spinning around real quickly and then spinning around the Sun pretty quickly but then you look at that in the context of the Galaxy which is moving incredibly slowly but vast it's always moving and inside you have the Sun moving it's it's kind of like that archetypal reality these archetypal beings to the extent that I was able to experience them clearly at all were vast living structures on a completely different order of causality in a different order of time I could not I could not wrap my mind around them I could not see them cognitively coherently I experienced this enormous living intelligences and the best my mind could do to give them some type of representation was to see them as galaxies so we've all looked at the Hubble telescopes we've all looked at these galaxies we've seen the pictures we if we really sit with them and meditate them we understand more deeply what we're looking at and these things are billions of light years across containing billions and billions of stars and so on so forth that's what my mind did just to frame this experience in some way but I could not penetrate beyond that they were just too big and too foreign to me to give them form at a lower level of archetypal reality I entered what I would call sort of a jungian level of archetype reality where I experienced repeatedly the human psyche and the human species as a single organism a single integrated organism and I experienced Networks physical and mental Networks connecting this organism uh kind of like the Neurology of this organism and I was shown repeatedly how the individual is hardwired and softwired into this Matrix of consciousness of the species mind and the species mind how it informs our individual Consciousness and how our individual Consciousness reaches out and informs and structures future species Consciousness so I I saw things like each one of us carry a holographic fractal piece of the diseases of our time of the mental diseases of the physical diseases and as we heal ourselves with these mental and physical diseases we actually contribute to the healing of the collective psyche so the collective psyche in a sense you would say it's more real than the individual psyche but I would give it maybe a little different vocabulary the individual is real the collective is real they have different kind of scales of their reality and they are mutually implicated in each other and both of these are transcended by the platonic archetypal levels of reality which are radically Beyond uh our human Collective psyche yeah perfectly understood yeah from that point on from archetypal reality and Beyond everything was about going into deeper and deeper levels of what is real in the world and we're not used to thinking of physical reality being on surface reel and that there are structures that are more deeply real but I think that quantum theory is comfortable with that string theorists are comfortable with that we should be able to be comfortable with that in psychology got it yeah I was just going to say uh perfectly understood can visualize it perfectly understand completely but there there's something really intuitive about it that that resonates um and um uh and actually people do have experiences of a sense of degree of reality sometimes um so just sticking to the reality point just for for a minute um there's I don't know if you've ever heard of this but there's this condition called depersonalization derealization disorder now as a disorder it's relatively rare but the experience of derealization is something that that I think something like upwards more than 50 of people at some point in their life experience at least a moment or something of derealization um and uh that dpdr the acronym is of course a like a DSM mental illness there's also the condition schizophrenia which has some kind of interesting relationship to Mystical visions that Carl Jung noted um and at least psychedelics themselves can induce or worsen schizophrenic symptoms and the visions that people might have and schizophrenia can overlap with sort of the Visions people might have with psychedelic stuff so there's a there's a connection there between there's some kind of connection there I'm just curious if your sense of just bouncing off those if your sense of mental illness has changed after your Journeys well that's a complicated topic isn't it and better answered by someone with psychedelic experience who is a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist who has much more training than I do in pathology and uh in our psychological makeup it has changed some uh was it Houston Smith who said a Mystic learns to swim in waters that the psychotic drowns in I think that was Joseph Campbell I believe yeah yeah so what's what we have in common is opening up into a reality that is beyond the private reality or the personal reality we open up to a larger expanse of reality which can be very destructive if you're not ready for it it can be very injurious it can be very traumatic it can be very tumultuous it can churn things up inside of you just opening up to Collective dimensions and that's why I really like all uh psychedelic therapists I emphasize the importance of accessing these dimensions and very carefully control circumstances with therapeutic support you know when you go into them and this is work that's not uh not advisable for a wide range of people I mean this is not necessarily it's not universally safe it really depends upon a lot of variables there are screening criteria which have been developed to help screen people who are good candidates for working with psychedelics and those who aren't uh nothing unusual here it's just part of the regimen um I'm less interested in trying to refine my understanding of disease and pathology other than in very broad senses understanding that people can be having legitimate access to transpersonal reality but in a way which is fractures or injures their ordinary their ability to function in the Ordinary World but I'm more interested in is differentiating those confusions those kind of lower level confusions between individual experience and these larger planes of reality from those breakthroughs where we begin to enter these larger Horizons but either because our original equipment was sufficiently strong or because our methodology is sufficiently rigorous and focused we don't experience it as traumatic we don't experience it as confusion confusing we experience it as clarifying and not the clarifying of an illusion or a delusion but truly truly metaphysically clarifying so that these become great spiritual and philosophical initiations into the deeper fabric of reality the sensation of that experience I think is very different than the kind of tumultuous confusion that can be generated uh in us in a pathological uh context got it totally yeah and yeah when you get to the collective level then it becomes something very different um so that's so thank you for that um uh you mentioned the the sort of five levels that you lay out um that there is the the personal the collective the archetypal the causal Oneness and the diamond Luminosity um and um uh just curious if you could take us up through to those levels um I know in another interview you said you hate that question because it's so challenging to talk about um I don't press you too hard we've gone into archetype or reality on the collective Dimension um and event in my experience what happened was after about a year and a half which is and 11 12 sessions not very much time I mean it really wasn't a lot of time because this is a reality archetypal reality is so vast it's so huge that I basically kind of went through it very quickly not experiencing the breadth of it but just penetrating through it pretty quickly and then entering going through yet another death and rebirth kind of dying out of the greater real into an even greater greater reel this letting go of another level of set of assumptions and entering into a year of a tremendously powerful experiences which I kind of grouped together into this category of of causal Oneness because that when you when you first enter transpersonal states of awareness or first enter spiritual levels of reality our experiences there are highly conditioned by our time space experience so that in time and space we all exist as separate individuals so when you move into spiritual reality you often tend to experience spiritual reality as composed of separate individuals but they're without a body they're just but they have that granular quality of of individual psyches or individual souls or individual entities if you go deeper into from Psychic level to subtle level of reality and using stand grass categories the units of Consciousness become larger you're still in levels of consciousness which are dualistic in the sense there's more than one of you present but the con the the entities are become increasingly large so that it becomes species Consciousness or Earth Consciousness or Angelic Realms they become just very very large so you move from a level of Consciousness that just highly conditioned by time space Consciousness into a deeper level of Consciousness Which is less conditioned by time space consciousness and then when you move into causal level reality the distinctive quality of that is that the entire universe is experienced as a single organism now the Oneness is a core core truth of course and it it manifests at many different levels I don't I don't mean to over differentiate you know these levels and and suggest that it's a it's literally climbing a ladder of Consciousness but my experience is basically unfolded in this kind of fashion when you experience the world as one it's it's not like experience intuiting the Oneness of life so that's part of it but you literally dissolve into the universe as it appears to be experiencing itself and as the universe experiences itself at that level there are no separate objects they're a separate their gradations and differentiations but all of those that are taking place within the tapestry within the Matrix of Oneness and that's what I mean by causal Oneness that I entered into a reality that I experienced as being in some ways beyond the archetype Beyond those divisions in which I experienced the world as a seamless fabric of reality and all other realities star realities Galaxy realities personal Consciousness realities Collective psyche realities all took place as organs within this larger Oneness in that context I had experiences of deep experiences of what the Buddhists call shunyata emptiness emptiness of form transparency where the experience the way it's put in Buddhist scriptures the Buddha awoke you know in his meditation and saw a self no self in himself and no self anywhere in the world so the way we usually experience the world is it's composed of separate entities and we are one of those entities but when you experience the world and the causal perspective you don't experience yourself as a separate self and you don't experience a separate self anywhere in the world now what is the world if there's no separate self in it no separate molecules no separate trees no separate life forms it is a living thriving Singularity a Oneness or a one organism so there were experiences of that there were experiences of Cosmic Love and love of course is the in a sense the emotion of Oneness when we experience love we are experiencing the emotional counterpart to the fact of Oneness uh experiences of the Void the Primal void out of which the universe arises in the Big Bang and experiences for part of me at this period was the birth of the diamond Soul which was a long lesson in where reincarnation is taking Humanity where is this singular Consciousness taking this little bitty species on this little bitty planet in this little bitty solar system that's what I mean by calls or reality the fundamental a deep deep encounter with the Oneness of life and then for me after about a year and a half at that level I went through yet another death rebirth process which is it's not ego death again it's it's not Collective ego death it's a deeper layer of of dying and being reborn and I was brought into States Of Consciousness which I experienced as being hyper hyper hyper crystal clear clear Beyond imagination just clear experiences of light but I had known light you know many times up to this point but this was an exceptionally clear form of light marked just striking out I know I'm saying the same word over and over again but that was the quality it's like my ordinary mind felt Gauzy and shadowy compared to this even Collective mind and even archetypal mind felt like Shadows compared to this which was clear Beyond imagination over the next four years I entered this state only four times so in 26 sessions I entered this reality only four times during in between those real in between those four sessions lots of episodes of cleansing lots of episodes of healing and purification purification because if you're going to maintain clear cognition at these deeper levels of consciousness you must go through a purification process that allows your entire system to acclimate to the levels of energy and the levels of reality that you're entering and so it's it's just a natural course that I've discovered that every time I entered into a deeper level of reality I was entering into a higher level of energy and so I had to go through this purification process otherwise my experience at this new level would not be clear it would not be I would not be able to remember my experiences clearly and you literally have to train yourself I know this is a little off the point but you have to train yourself to maintain cognitive coherence in these deeper levels of reality otherwise you may get glancing insights or you know short glimpses here and there short touches but your mind in order to truly stay that this reality for hours and hours at a time you have to go through this deep transformational process so for me I went into the diamond luminosity and went deeper into it for two of these four sessions and then things changed I had a particular experience and from that point on things changed I wasn't going deeper into Diamond Luminosity the diamond Luminosity was crunching itself more and more deeply into my physical body into my mental body into my psychological and emotional body and then I had one last what I consider one of the last big visions of of my entire journey and then uh it was wrapped up two more sessions the universe is kind of wrapped it up and said sayonara said see you so wow amazing and the Breath of Life expansion the contraction you see that in your journey it's everywhere um and uh one of the two thoughts one of the Striking things that I took away from the book personally was um the shift in understanding of ineffability and that different levels being hard to find language for is a matter of stabilizing and familiarity and not necessarily a complete inherent lack of understanding that so that's one takeaway and then the other one maybe even a bigger one I just opened up the page to the book here where you mention it is one small little section called Beyond The Diamond luminosity and the humor of of the the failure of language you know going from Clarity Beyond Clarity to all capitals hyper Clarity and Beyond the light of all light better than or more light than the other light going to Absolute light um and you're understanding that uh this points to there being more than just uh they're being like uh infinite number of levels potentially as as being the the takeaway from that um let me say something about that because it does it that did represent a major turning point for me so setting the stage I'm now 15 years into this journey I've gone through the ocean of suffering I've gone through ego death I've gone through archetypal reality I've gone through lots of experiences of causal of reality and then I I get dropped into this communion with this infinitely satisfying clear Diamond Luminosity what Buddhism calls uh the clear light of absolute reality so I get back into that the second time which is the 50th session second time I'm in that reality um I'm as deep into the universe as I've ever been before I couldn't ask for anything more that I was being given at the time and all of a sudden my visual field pivoted 90 degrees and I saw reality far far in the distance again it looked kind of like galaxies and out of that reality a beam of light came and hit me and it absolutely shattered me it just it was a more powerful light than even the diamond Luminosity that had become my Ultimate Reality and just in that one second it completely changed my understanding of reality in that I had adopted the belief from multiple sources that there was an end point to this work you know you want to get to the goal you do this become one with God or to be dissolve into the void the Primal void of all existence and I had become one with God in many different variations and I had entered the the Primal void but I I still had this sense that there was an end point to this journey and I was pushing so hard to get to the end point uh I don't know what was I was expecting to be waiting for me at the end point but I knew it was going to be good and what this session showed me was that it is an infinite Universe I'll never get to the end of it it's just too vast too huge and it's 50 sessions in 50 high-dose sessions in and I was shown this glimpse of a reality far far beyond anything that I would reach in this lifetime and at that point I let go completely of the idea of reaching a deeper uh or an endpoint reality and I it changed into trying to absorb the reality that I was being opened into as deeply as I could into my into my personal being so yeah that was a major turning point and that's one of the reasons I would if I were doing this over again I would be gentler with myself because one of the reasons I was pushing so hard was because I had adopted a false belief that there is an end point now I should be careful there are homecomings you you go through experiences of coming home and this is a tremendous sense of return and tremendous sense of ecstasy and joy of of homecoming but even those I don't think are they are not ultimate at least they're not in my experience they are they are markers on longer journey and that's why I would be gentle I would I would have a different orientation for what the purpose or what the value of these exercises are totally um totally um and uh I think my shift in understanding through the book too also that one paragraph changed everything for me in a similar way I thought yeah I want to reach the end point too and then that changed that um um so uh so I guess following that thread coming back down the mountain as you've gone through these experiences um you had a vision of the future and of the uh of what may be coming in the future um and uh could you tell us about what that was like what that looked like and um how uh that's evolved for you since I know since you published the book the covid pandemic happened yeah well this is not so much coming down the mountain but still climbing the mountain it actually started when I was in the end stages of the ocean of suffering work when I was in the chapter the initiation of the universe I started being given Visionary initiations into the human story and the stages of human evolution and in particular this the story that I was being initiated into was the story that Humanity was coming to a turning point in its evolutionary development it was coming to a major transformative pivot that would change the nature of Life on this planet and I just had a series of Visions over four years in the early to mid 1990s of what I call the visions of Awakening was that the that there was an historical process uh that was trying to awaken not just individuals it was trying to awaken the entire species that was the historical work at hand a transformation that was truly Collective uh a a transformation not simply of our psychological well-being or some levels of psychological truth but a transformation of the fundamental plate tectonics of the art of the collective psyche the archetypal structure of the deep psyche was in the process of undergoing a revision a transition so this for four years these Visions kept coming into me and this completely surprised me because again I was at the tail end of thinking this my work was about personal transformation and yet these Visions were consistently about Collective transformation nowhere was I shown how nature was going to pull off this transformation nature or Divine or whatever you think of it's the driving force how how are we going to undergo this profound transition that I was being shown and then in 1995 when I was in the middle of the diamond Luminosity work and I had entered the diamond Luminosity twice and it had that experience we just talked about I'd done a Year's worth of more purification and I was expecting given the rhythms of what had gone on before I was expecting to be taken back into the diamond Luminosity material again but that's not what happened what happened was first I dissolved radically into the species mind I'd gone into that territory before I had learned how to go through this process so I dissolved into the mind of our species and I I ceased to function as crispace and I began to function and somehow I know this sounds extreme but in somehow I was functioning as the species of humanity at some core level I had become a human species and then I was also I was taken deep into deep time I'd gone into deep time many times previously this took me deeper into deep time than I had gone before and basically in that session I experienced the death and Rebirth of humanity I experienced a global crisis that we were coming into and I experienced it as the species will experience it it didn't give me the details it didn't tell me when where how exactly it told me it showed me the fact of this crisis it showed me that we would make it through this crisis and it gave me certain key insights in how of the mechanisms of transformation that were involved in this crisis but basically what I experienced in this session was Humanity coming to a turning point in its history and a profound unraveling a com a deep deconstruction of reality as we had known it an undoing of all the assumptions that we were making uh it seemed as if this was a Global Systems crisis that was being driven by a series of ecological crises at the time I should say this is 25 years ago right I didn't know I knew next to nothing about the Global Systems crisis I didn't know about ecological crises I didn't you know this I was totally naive about these things but what I experienced was Humanity came to a point where we basically lost control of Our Lives we were not able to control the reality of Our Lives we basically were on an Extinction trajectory and just when it reached its peak we went through a threshold and the danger began to subside and we began to as it were pick ourselves up on the other side of this years decades-long series of crises and when we picked ourselves up and when we began to reorganize ourselves after this crisis we found that we had been profoundly and deeply and permanently changed by this crisis we had it led to we were changed at the core level of our essential psyche of our of our Collective psyche this crisis opened up our heart to one another and opened up our mind to the universe in a way that was collectively unprecedented and as we began to interact in this post-crisis reality um there was a synergistic feeding off of PA of patterns and Trends and feeding back and forth all circulating around new values new perceptions of the good new understandings of Life new understandings of ourselves new understandings of the universe new capacities that were opening within the human heart in the human mind foreign in the 70th session one that what I refer to as this last Visionary experience I was taken deeper into deep time and given one last quota on this trajectory but the the net result of all of this is that I came to see or what I was being shown was that Humanity was in the process of giving birth to us next evolutionary form to the next higher form of being a human being and if you ask what is the form of the future human what will the future human look like I think the key is understanding reincarnation this refers to another series of lessons that I was given where I was shown experientially personally and experientially where reincarnation is taking Humanity where are we going and this was different than the Eastern Traditions that I had assimilated in graduate school that that vision is you grow and you grow and you grow and you change you achieve some type of spiritual breakthrough to your individual essence you know Atman is Brahman we are Divine and when you have that spiritual breakthrough you achieve what the Hindus called Moksha Escape which means you escape samsara you no longer have to be incarnated you achieve realization you achieve enlightenment and then you enter par Nirvana you leave the physical Universe behind what was Paramount in my sessions was not that it was the vision that we grow and we grow and we change or we grow and hopefully more compassionate more understanding more Talent so on so forth but there Comes A Time well the way I understand reincarnation we die we expand to our soul Consciousness we make a choice to Incarnate we contract into egoic Consciousness we expand in the soul Consciousness come back into egoic Consciousness and we've been doing this for tens of thousands possibly hundreds of thousands of years and if we do that sooner or later Soul Consciousness wakes up inside individual historical consciousness so that my experience was I had an experience where at a critical point in one Journey all of my Farmer lives started to come back into me and I had known I had done you know past life therapy I knew a dozen or so of my former lives in detail but all of my former lives started to come back into me and at one particular point they seemed to reach a critical mass and they there was an explosion of energy and this energy fused all those individual lives into a single consciousness and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness that was individual but a form of individuality beyond anything that I had ever understood and I think that's what's happening to us on this planet we and we have been gestating the future human for thousands and thousands of years we are about to give birth to that future human in history in the century I believe gestation is long birth is very short traumatic I think that we're entering a time of History which is going to be traumatic it's going to be very painful it's going to be very difficult the way labor is difficult but I believe based only on my psychedelic experience that we do make it through and we are deeply changed in the process and we grow up we grow up into our next evolutionary form the future human and on those few occasions in my sessions when I was allowed to experience the future human they were deeply and profoundly ecstatic experiences just totally humbling and just you know just a radically transformed Humanity coming out of this process and I think that this chapter the birth of the future human in the book is the most important chapter in the book because it if it's true it concerns your children my children our grandchildren our grandchildren's grandchildren it concerns all of us what's happening at a very very deep level and it also helped me understand some of the historical currents that were taking place in this context kovid is to me it's like a little shot across the bow you know it's like a little Overture it's not the real Symphony it's just the Overture to the symphony it's just it's a taste um of how vulnerable we are to deep and profound disruption and how quickly the entire structure of our society can pivot that's what we should have should be learning from covid and our interdependence and how much we have to work together to rise to the challenge that's coming at us the challenges will be much deeper um than covid and much longer lasting and much more serious and life-threatening I think yeah thank you yeah um the vision was very powerful um and uh I didn't have the vision I can't speak to it directly but there are obviously signs of that happening um you know ecological signs and um I know there's tons of literature on systems crisis and vulnerability and we say that financially that's for sure we've seen that play out um when covet happened one of the things we saw here in Canada was just toilet paper ran out everyone was doing the rush for toilet paper a little hint at what can happen right how quickly it can happen um and uh what comes to mind is the I think it's a Chinese proverb I don't know maybe Einstein said it maybe um something it was something like you know um uh Society will be good or the world will be happy when people are willing to plant trees that will only be seen by the Next Generation so the idea that it seemed so intuitive something clicked when he said about the souls fusing together about being able to understand and see that we'll have reincarnations in the future and so we'll actually be on this planet when we die again um so something very intuitive change isn't it you know yeah American traditions of making your decisions based upon how they impact Seven Generations recognizing that we will be those Generations so the Earth we leave is the earth we inherit and it just it broadens our sense of responsibility and Gwen Ellison says this basically we have to move from being a species stuck at the Adolescent level to the mature adult level and the when you're at the mature adult level you you look at the broader impact across society and through history of the decisions and the choices that you're making and my sense is we no longer can afford to try to run this planet based on egoic consciousness the culture that we have created the history that we have lived is a history that has been created by the ego now I know the eagle gets a bad rap in spiritual traditions and I think the ego is beautiful and to me it's an it's exquisitely beautiful uh structure of Consciousness but it's fundamentally isolated it doesn't really experience the deeper fabric of our connective tissue we can no longer afford to run this planet by or have this planet run by human beings who are operating only out of an egoic level of Consciousness because that inevitably creates push-pull that creates Wars it creates upper classes and lower classes those who have and those who don't the privilege and the unprivileged we need to grow up and we need to basically grow up into our soul Consciousness knowing that now our soul we have experienced lives as all the races on the planet all the nations on the planet all the classes on the planet all of those are alive within us and making our choices out of that level of Consciousness yeah I Can Only Imagine that would be like um so I've I've got something for you Chris I've got to get it for you um because that when you uh you you share the vision the book I'll just read it you say um I saw the future humans standing up and this seems significant against the background of many seated Buddhas this being was standing upright um so uh you mentioned that uh your your form of art is writing um and and that's beautiful some people they use visual art like Carl Jung for uh visualizing their their Visions uh well one tool that we have available to us now is the tool of AI art where you can put in prompts and receive images and things so I've just emailed to you just right now I just hit send um an AI art image I generated of that image as best as I could represent it I see it yeah I see it that's beautiful that's beautiful yeah so my sense is that in history we've hit basically the meditating Buddha the meditating Buddha or any meditating being in in an awakened condition gets quiet and quiet on the outside in order to still the minds of the mind can penetrate through the layers and touch the deeper sense of reality and a standing Buddha is someone who incorporates the clarity of that sitting posture but the dynamism of standing and walking and acting and and I think that's that's where we're going it's it's not about simply a waking up it's a waking up and acting on that awakened Consciousness and bring it forward thank you for that image that's really beautiful yeah awesome yeah it's a very large scaled one so feel free to do whatever you want with it yeah um awesome so um awesome so we're shifting more so I I've there I've got some specific things I want to ask you about two and a half I'm glad that we've covered all this so far because now it contextualizes it um I'm very interested in I love that it's sort of bringing back those uh those Concepts and experiences back down to Here and Now like on Earth at this level of Consciousness and and operating here um and some of the things that we condemned with here are the reality of needing to operate in the world that we have sort of traditions from the past that we have handed down to us Edward was born in this life and we see that there are religions that we can certain paths that we can follow and there are certain deities that can be worshiped and um there are many choices in how to how to navigate this world and that's been a very strong question for me personally at least and how do I want to walk in life um now I guess maybe the first question is so how is your understanding of uh God and religion change through your Journeys and how might that relate to the lack of one ultimate level and uh medical existence that's a big question yeah that question I need to drink some water [Laughter] well you know I was a religious studies professor and I started I mean I my first vocation in life was my I wanted to be a Catholic priest I was raised in the Roman Catholic tradition and I was in the Seminary for four years and the the Catholic tradition treated me well I didn't get any trauma and it was you know it was a good Shake um but and then I did my masters I did a degree undergraduate degree in theology at Notre Dame and then I did a master's in New Testament criticism at Cambridge and then I did philosophy of religion at Brown and by the time I finished graduate school I had pretty much studied my way out of religion altogether I kind of recapitulated the transition from medieval theology in the Catholic tradition to the scriptural Revelation the scriptural revolution in protestantism to the scientific critique of religion in the modern mind and basically I finished as a pretty sophisticated agnostic with very high standards for um any possibility of conceptualizing Beyond something Beyond time and space something approximating God's dimensions so I had let go of concepts of God I I and I since I had studied not just one religious tradition but I had studied multiple religious Traditions I began to understand the common threads but also the differences in the world religions and I also studied how religions came into existence and they say that uh Dogma is like sausage you really don't want to see it made and when you really watch how Dogma is created historically it's so filled with human errors and human foibles that you just don't want to eat that kind of stuff so I had gone through that and I pretty much had scrubbed my mind of all things having to do with Theology and deities and things like that and that's that was the mind that I started the Psychedelic work and what happened was of course uh the Psychedelic work initiated me into the reality that was behind those Concepts and it took me into the spiritual reality that had given birth to these approximations through history but it took me into it on the one hand it led me to affirm the reality of the deeper intelligence that lies behind its physical existence but it did not lead me to to affirm any individual lineage of deity or teachers and even collectively the nature of my experience was to transcend even the collective religious Enterprise so that it entered it drew me into the reality a a reality of the Divine which is so far beyond our historical attempts to conceptualize the Divine in history that truly you know we say I'm spiritual not religious it's that's a Trope I know but it's kind of like that I I did not relate and I I do not relate in any devotional sense to any of the religions on the planet while I respect him enormously and I understand them and I I respect the the polishing that they can give Human Nature my psychedelic experiences took me in a world beyond that world so on the one hand I I affirm a Divine intelligence while I don't like the word divine and that's why I talk about the mind of the universe because I'd rather speak in those categories than in theological categories but that there is an extraordinary infinite intelligence and infinite compassion that gives birth to existence and that embodies that the physical universe is the body of this being of this manifest being and there might be other universes in you know our universe is not necessarily the only Universe in existence but there are other universes with all the levels and complexities that ours has so it's it's a complex answer isn't it on the one hand it affirms a spiritual reality it affirms Divine reality and I also don't feel inclined to narrow my love of this intelligence to any historical religious forms got it very tough topic 100 and um I definitely see uh the hesitation to or not hesitation the very clear sense of not wanting to start your own thing basism the Psychedelic path [Laughter] um and um so there it's interesting one hand people speak about the meaning crisis that we face in the west the scientific materialism is sort of graspled and we've completely uh uh wiped out any higher Realms from our sense of reality um and in you know the coming just challenges that we're going to face if that culminates in a in a in a global crisis as you describe or otherwise that uh we have to contend with the world and and we need to navigate in the world and um have a sense of meaning and purpose and self-understanding is part of that um leading up to this future human we have decisions and actions that we can take as individuals and not everyone can can walk the Psychedelic path to necessarily realize these things themselves um how do you see people pairing themselves or or moving forward in light of this understanding of of the Great Awakening well you're absolutely right we we are living in a time of a crisis of meaning uh because the materialism of early science not post Quantum science but of early science which still tends to dominate Humanities and the social sciences is a world that's stripped of meaning it's it's a world that has no meaning and there is nothing Beyond physical reality and physical reality is seen as evolving by pure chance so there's no existential significance your life has no meaning associated with it there is no existential significance to the challenges that you may be facing psychologically or physically are are socially it's just pure random nature is blind it's violent and I all my life I've been working with students at University campuses and that's the philosophy that they've been taught in all their other courses you know that reality to be real you have to face the meaninglessness of existence and then you push on from there that is one of the great values of psychedelics because psychedelics can pop that bubble you know it doesn't take too long to pop that bubble you know give me one weekend a month for one year and we can pretty much shatter that so at least we can see that there is a reality that's behind the physical Universe we can experience to some degree the intelligence of design that is expressing itself in the creative manifestation of time and space and and the structures in time and space uh that's a very powerful uh breakthrough I think that's one of the major contributions that psychedelics can make for us is not simply healing us of our trauma and healing us of our wounds but initiating us initiating us into this on the one hand ancient and on the other hand new worldview that the world is alive the world is saturated with intelligence and there's layers and layers and layers of intelligence and we can commune with this intelligence we can download from this intelligence we can you know enter into it just to Justice have this sense that there is a purpose to life there is an intelligence expressing itself that's one of the reasons why I think reincarnation is so important because we have hard data that reincarnation is true because you know we have those verified memories of our deep past and that tells us that gives us a deeper understanding of what the what might be driving the things that we undertake In Our Lifetime that there is a hidden purpose a hidden project folded into the details of our life circumstance this is just one of the things that comes very very clear in past life therapy by expansion when we begin to see the purpose not only in our individual lives but the purpose that's percolating inside our Collective Evolution and the purposes behind biological evolution and the emergence of Life the emergence of self-aware life and so on and so forth that gives us some grounds for beginning to Hope that there is meaning behind this crisis that we're coming into that this crisis is going to be terrible I mean it's going to be test terrible this is not we're not going to get through this easily and I believe we will survive it but we will not survive unchanged we will be deeply Changed by it and to enter into this process with this belief that somehow it's all an accident and it has no meaning it has no significance it's a terrible terrible philosophy to take into what's coming now having said that the experience of the meaningfulness of existence are the the intelligence that runs throughout all of life that doesn't mean necessarily that our first or second or third take on this intelligence is necessarily correct because there's a sense in which just to touch the the enormous scale of creation is a humbling experience and it tends to lead you to hold on to your Concepts lightly delicately because you know that your concepts are only small approximations of something which is much much larger then your mind is going to wrap itself around but just to have the experience that there is this power manifesting itself in life encourages us I think to live our life with deep Integrity To Live our life with deep purpose and to actualize the purpose of our incarnation as deeply as we can my understanding is that before we incarnate we choose our Incarnation and there's lots of research that suggests that so my sense is that every one of us every human being on the planet now chose the Incarnation that they are currently living all right and if that's the case then all we need to do is do the best we can with the Incarnation that we are living and the rest will take care of itself all right and I think that's a pretty healthy way to engage what's coming at us to do the very best we can and let the end results work themselves out beautiful and of course immediately begs the question what is the best that we can do you know um although there there's something uh immediate about we have things that immediately call us in our in our environment so there's there's definitely something else to that um okay so uh I I hear what you're saying about attaching ourselves to Concepts lightly um and at the same time uh with our our practices or spiritual practices we may have a stronger hold on those as the process maybe not attached to the meaning that we attribute to the end goal or things like that um I'd like to explore this a little bit more specifically too and one of the ways that we can that we confront the world comes to a basic principle as far as I can understand it is that where where attention goes energy flows is the idea you mentioned earlier that when we sort of worship or give praise to entities or say Collective principles that it can kind of give rise to those as images and the collective unconscious and the way I understand worship is being like a it's like a practice of of directing attention to the highest value the highest good some some aim that you have that you know whether that's Nirvana or whether that's creating the kingdom of God on Earth in Christianity or or the Gnostic image of uh separating from the earth sort of up and out image that the gnostics had um what the worship does is it helps people sort of realign their values and their actions to maintain themselves as they walk on on that spiritual path and you know certain Concepts become devalued and it sort of maintains a structure of reality with certain things having more importance than others um uh big question but how are we to Worship in in light of the the Diamond luminosity and pun intended laughs well I'll tell you how I worship I worship the universe I worship the the diversity of life on the planet I worship the manifestation of galaxies and solar systems and and star systems I worship that's what's I worship the the Manifest abundance and the unfolding complexity of life itself and I honor the hidden drivers of this reality and you know science is telling us what 95 is dark energy and dark matter 96 is and dark energy and dark matter which we've never seen and we really don't understand only four percent uh is visible in any realistic form so it's not that big a stretch to to think that the universe is growing it's an unfolding out of an extraordinarily complex and infinite reality so I honor the men of the universe as the Manifest body of this intelligence and I honor the intelligence which is manifesting as this body at the same time so to me uh you know the medieval cathedrals of Europe were created in order to you walk into them and the the idea is they lift your eye to a higher Horizon to a deeper understanding to me um spending time digesting the images that were given to us by the Hubble telescope and its successor those are spiritual experiences those are profoundly Rich spiritual meditations on on the intelligence that's manifesting itself as our universe and then for me I I reflect on my own experiences I mean I I can't manifest the experiences that I've had inside my time space body I wish I could but I can't manifest I'm in luminosity in my daily daily Consciousness but I can remember and I can meditate upon and I can bring those experiences into my mind and I can enter back into the edges of those experiences as part of as part of a deepening of my own living process right and I I'm also deeply moved by other people's experiences of this infinite intelligence so that's why I really enjoy reading other people's psychedelic experiences because I don't want to get trapped simply in my lens in my particular lens I'd like to see this infinite mystery as it's experienced by many different people because that enriches my sense of its of its complexity wow wow I think I wrote wow like 50 times in the book as I was going along um uh what comes back from me is coming back to the scientific materialism and maybe the an immediate thing that um that could happen is a softening of our concept of scientific materialism and hopefully psychedelics can play a part in that um I I do want to mention uh interesting maybe coincidence maybe it's not strong enough to be a synchronicity but for me um reading your book when you mentioned Carl Jung a few times I thought oh my God no way and then you specifically mentioned Carl Young's the red book which I'm in the middle of right now um which is crazy and then you mentioned Richard tarnis a few times and um he and then he specifically said one point he mapped out a history of the ideas of Western thought lo and behold I'm in the middle of Richard tarnis is The Passion of the western mind at the same time very interesting book and you realize just how immature well re decent let's say scientific materialism is like 300 years something a scale of tens of thousands yeah um so that was a funny um coincidence uh for me so um if we can wrap it around psychedelics are a tool not necessarily for everyone um how could we best use psychedelics for Spiritual Awakening in light of the coming uh challenges that we may face thank you well I hope we use them for more than Spiritual Awakening I think for example uh the whole movement in the Psychedelic Renaissance towards healing is really important um because for I think when I look at human beings I don't simply see a human being I tend to see souls and so when I look at children I don't see I don't see young beings they could be very very old beings in a young body and when I see old beings I don't necessarily see I mean old people I don't see old beings it could be a very young soul and an old body and so I I tend to look at the qualities of soul that are present in an Incarnation and my sense is at this particular time in history people are incarnating with lots of former lives active in their current life and they're incarnating with lots of unfinished business at the soul level alive in their life there's a sense and that means that healing is a very important contribution not only to their individual well-being but to our Collective well-being so my sense is that we are incarnating generations of pain and suffering in this generation in these generations and that by clearing this pain and suffering we are clearing out the whole system of all the garbage of our leftover from our egoic Consciousness through thousands of years of incarnations and we're opening up and creating space for this deeper infusion of cosmic Consciousness to enter into our lives so psychedelics can be a significant part of this healing so that's the one second if healing is allowed to deepen then it becomes a tool of initiation into the intelligence of the universe the intelligence that lies at the very core of our being and it it gets psychedelics and help us experience even if only temporarily the truth of our divine nature and the truth of our inclusive nature so that it really is like we are all leaves on a tree and every leaf truly is part of my being and only at the surface level does it look like we're separate leaves but as a tree we experience that we are all implicated in each other's lives and so naturally compassion arises fairness Justice com arises out of that so psychedelics can help us deepen and accelerate this process a whole separate issue is the balancing of psychedelics with spiritual practice which is non-psychedelic I mean I that's a whole separate issue I don't think psychedelics by themselves is necessarily A very wise way to proceed you need the the support and grounding and insights that have been kept alive in our spiritual Traditions our meditative traditions and contemplative Traditions that I think these two work hand in hand well with each other so I think those are maybe the most important one of the is the the accelerating of healing and the deepening of our insight into our true nature and into the nature of the universe and then if we want to push farther cosmological exploration just takes that one step farther into a a conscious opening to layers of reality that lie Beyond simply our physical senses and I think you don't have to push it as far as I did to do a little bit of cosmological exploration which can be very healthy and very supportive I think I just pushed it so far so hard it you know it just it becomes a [Music] a life defining project and there's no need for it to become a life-defining project for many people but I think psychedelics have multiple layers of benefit that they can give us at this time they can help heal us they can help us come to our spiritual senses and they can help give us a sense of the deeper mystery that we're part of got it beautiful yeah um I'd like to bring us back to just one little point I kind of skipped over uh one little thought I wanted to ask you about and just coming back to the I the the uh understanding of there being infinite levels that are higher and higher and higher or by Houston Smith's love inverse analogy deeper and deeper and deeper um how do we align ourselves with the highest if there is no highest [Laughter] oh yeah your question catches the Paradox as it catches the issue yeah you know let me let me give you a this is gonna sound a little off Target but it'll be it'll I'll focus it in I often think that um the relationship of physical reality to spiritual reality can be modeled on an Apple uh and physical reality is the skin of the Apple all right so the entire physical world and all the levels is the skin of the apple and if you if an apple starts and it's expanding you know it's like the the universe is expanding and getting bitter the skin is getting bigger but the the meat of the apple is spiritual reality and we have a tendency because we think of psychedelics as mind expanding mind opening and there is a subjective sense that the the reality that we're entering is bigger than our physical reality that tends to convey a sense that spiritual reality is bigger than physical reality but I don't think that's necessarily an Insight that generates when you go deeper and deeper that sense of expansion into deeper space changes so I'd like to give a different metaphor um if you go underneath physical reality you get into a layer of spiritual reality and if you go deeper in a deeper layer of spiritual reality you start to drive towards the center of the apple and as you drive deeper towards the center of the real the apple of course forms fall away because Farms are part of the emergence of physical reality and the light gets brighter and brighter and brighter as you drive to the center of the Apple it's because you're at the center is light and light eventually manifests the green textures of the apple skin but in the end it's light so you're asking the question now how do we Orient ourselves to the ultimate even knowing that the ultimate is beyond our intellectual grasp right and I think the key to that is recognizing that the essence of my life and the essence of your life is fundamentally the same essence we all come from the light we are all fractal embodiments of the light we are all evolving expressions of this manifesting intelligence is self-manifesting intelligence and at that very very deep level my Essence is the same as the essence of mosquitoes and ants and leaves and everything on the planet and that's why when when I go into a transcendental state that is I drop into selflessness or shunyata I experience the world as one and that's the shamans would Shout Out All My Relations all other levels of reality all of their beings are My Relations we're all kin in this planet even though we may not be able to adequately conceptualize this Essence individual Essence the Atman the Brahman we can tune to it we can know it we can let it suffuse our being we can we can let go of anything small which keeps us smaller than it and we can regularly cultivate the practice of tuning to it and that's not that is only partly an intellectual exercise it's it's deeper than an intellectual exercise it's more of a tuning exercise and that we can do even without having an adequate understanding of the final goal it's it's just like it's an enjoyment there is a sense of peace there is a sense of Harmony there is a sense of Infinite Challenge and the challenge of infinity um but there's a profound sense of alignment that comes about in our person and in our relationships the closer we draw to that reality and we can do all of that without having any solid answers to what is the nature of Ultimate Reality got it I mean not really got it but yeah I'm glimpsing it um that what comes to mind is uh the distinction between process oriented uh say spiritual practice or religion and then goal-oriented religion or spiritual practice is that useful there it can be I mean basically one way of putting that we can live in a world of nouns or we can live in a world of verbs verbs are more accurate than nouns right and that's just one of the insights that science and philosophy gets so we live in a world of process rather than a world of objects right and it's all a process a human being is a is a process which begins lives and dies you know it goes Consciousness goes evolves and completely constantly changing constantly changing neither you or I are the same at the end of our conversation as we were at the beginning we've been changed by this contact so it's all verbs it's all process yeah yeah and looking noting the time um maybe one thing one more thing on this topic I'll just bring up it's just it's just this is what it comes back to at least for me is um you know in in certain scriptures I just will pick Christianity you know Jesus says not one word will change in the scriptures until all is said and done and other ones Islam you know worship no other God but me or whatever this kind of exclusionary thing doesn't seem to just be like a cultural interpretation of it's like right there in the core of the revelation of the religion I don't know what do you make of that in two minutes I understand I understand it uh you know there was a time in our history not that long ago where religions existed basically on specific continents they were just kind of before the invention of the steam engine religions existed in a valley in a particular landscape there wasn't mass migrations of populations moving around the religion was part of a place it was tied to a place and when you bump up against other people in another place there is a conflict between how your people see the reality and how those people see reality and so the honoring the Integrity of the vision was part of the process of the people owning their identity in contrast to other people who have a different vision and a different identity but of course all of this changed with the invention of the steam engine and then with the invention of travel and then with the invention of the internet now everything's getting blended and now ever since the 19th century Scholars have been putting together these amalgams of gathering the world's wisdom together into his massive compendiums of trying to understand it all we're wrapping our mind around the entire planet in that context I think we what we recognize is that what may have been a virtue in the ancient past now can become an encumbrance it can become a limitation so now I think the greater wisdom is in understanding all of these religious Traditions simultaneously and understanding that the part the whole is greater than any of the individual parts and so that the pattern of spirituality for the planet as a whole is a larger and more interesting story than the pattern of spirituality in one particular tradition versus another Spirit another particular tradition okay so it's just a different truth that comes forward in different historical circumstances so on the one hand I recognize I recognize the sentiment that you described and I honor it as an historical sentiment but I don't feel beholden to it to me the greater challenge has been to try to understand the world's diversity of religious beliefs and spiritual beliefs and then to in my particular case to take the exploration so deep that it radically eclipses all of our Human Experience in the larger landscape that emerges in deep spiritual experience wow and just to wrap it up I'll just add I got a sense of that the first thing I ever read that led me down the super deepening the spiritual path was Joseph Campbell and his I'm writing about exactly that this Global sense of all the world's um uh Traditions yes so thank you Chris so much so much to to meditate on Luke it's been a pleasure I've thank you for the conversation thank you for giving me a lot of room uh to work and for your very thoughtful seating of questions I appreciate it thank you and I hope that uh this and other interviews will help you in digesting your own Journeys and having the community finally to share uh your experiences with so I I feel that I feel part of the same Community with you um and I'm excited to see what you put out in the future these conversations do help me and sharing is good and I hope they're useful to other people but they truly help me too because it it helps me digest all these things got it awesome thank you Chris</p>

      <p>did you connect with a being or beings or Angels or other Divine entities and and if you could share a little bit about what that realm was like in all the years when I was doing this work in all the work I did I never encountered a being a Divine being said I'm God you know this is what I am it wasn't like that it was like I would go deeper into a level of Consciousness and I would experience a communion with this Consciousness and this Consciousness would teach me it knew me it would teach me and show me things and it would crush me and then bring me forward into still deeper levels and I would go into those deeper levels and I would enter into communion with those levels and and I internalized the energy of those levels and I was with this Consciousness but it never crystallized into a specific form I always felt its Pres pres it guided my sessions I could enter into dialogue with it I could enter into communion with it it would it would dissolve me into itself but it never crystallized into a what you might call a personality of God or a person of God and it just kept getting larger and larger deeper and deeper more and more vast and I think that many of our theologies of God or our thinking about God is really based upon uh what I would call the early encounters with an infinite intelligence that that this infinite intelligence is far larger far too large to ever be concretized in the historical lineages that we recognize in the world traditions</p>

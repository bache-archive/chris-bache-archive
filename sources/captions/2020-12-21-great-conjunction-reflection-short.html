bash to share some words with us um I want to thank you very much for taking the time to do this Chris and I know it's getting later in the evening for you um excuse me and uh I imagine a lot of you uh the rest of us know Chris by now to some degree through his work um uh but if you don't I just want to suggest that uh if you have any interested in the Fate any interest at all in the fate of humanity uh you get yourself a copy of LSD in the mind of the universe his most recent book and uh it's a stunner it really is um in a beautiful and positive way so thank you for joining us grais over to you thank you Stephen am I coming through okay Mark sound okay good yeah it's a pleasure and an honor to be with the community again it's uh truly especially on this uh winter solstice and especially on this winter solstice Saturn conjunct Jupiter entering into Aquarius good sign good time hopefully a marker of changes that are coming it's been a hard year the pandemic has touched us all in one way or another and many of us are looking forward to 220 2021 that's a a time of a shift a time of change and I'm sure it will be I hope it will be so a few words spoken softly in the mode in the manner of our special ceremony tonight about our Collective transformation I've picked this picture of the Earth to start with because the Earth is going into convulsions it seems like there's no way to stop it now we can amarate it but we're going into the dark night of our Collective Soul we have set in motion a sequence of events that's taking in into to a very very turbulent convulsive period of History that's what my reading of the ecological sources tell me it's also what my Visionary experiences tell me in psychedelic work we are going into a time of ascending energy a time in which nature is reaching down and bringing up energy underneath our feet taking us taking Humanity in into an extraordinary new phase of its evolutionary Journey a time of Great Awakening A Time of great spiritual fruition a time of a change in the fundamental archetypal architecture of the collective psyche that informs all of our individual psyches as we work together but when this happens when Nature turns up the heat underneath us it triggers profound purification processes it triggers a process in which we have no choice but to confront our shadows both our individual Shadow and our Collective Shadow because our shadow is rising and it's a time in history when our shadow is rising and clearly the ecological consequences that we are inheriting in this Century are aspects of this large Collective Shadow and the ego and a civiliz ation of ego that has made the decisions that they've made with respect to the Earth and made the decisions they've made with respect to each other those are all coming out on us really hard now it's all coming forward so I want to change perspective a little bit and take us because if we really want to go deep into this Collective transformation if we want to engage it fully it's a good time to step back it's a good night to step back into a larger context but I'm going to encourage this to step even farther back to place ourselves in the context and in the presence of the creative intelligence of the universe of the Divine intelligence or the creative intelligence the great power and these Starlights behind me are not just Stars some are stars but many are galaxies with billions ions and billions of stars an unimaginable outpouring of power and genius just incredible genius unfolding and it's the same genius which birthed this universe which is birthing his time in history and it's the same genius which has placed us here to participate consciously in this Milestone period this Milestone century that we have come into we will come out of this Century profoundly different than we came into it and so I'd like to encourage you to think about who is it that's undergoing this transformation who is it that's engaging these powerful forces carrying us forward and it's not who we think we are we are not who we think we are we have by habit a custom of thinking of ourselves as basically hundredy old beings but the science of Consciousness tells us today clearly we are not 100y old beings reincarnation is a simple fact of life and knowing this when we look at ourselves we see that we are 100,000 year old beings we have enormous quantities of time folded into the person that we now are every Talent that we have every piece of Genius that we have every habit that we have even our bad habits that we have they come from somewhere they come from a deeper history and one way to imagine a human being as a reincarnated being is the samurai sword which is made from folding level upon level upon level of metal folded and hammered over each other up to 10,000 layers of metal subjected to Fierce heat and fused together to create a blade of incredible lightness and strength and Agility and I think a soul is that too we are the result this generation is the result of hundreds and thousands of lifetimes of precious Human Experience of precious learning folded in upon one another folded upon one another and are being fused and just as the planet is facing a huge crisis to become one planet one ecosystem one system that lives in a healthy manner with each other with the planet itself if that's taking place in the outer social World there is a similar process taking place in our inner world I think it's a time when all of our farmer lives are coming into us really hard we were born with many of our farmer lives active in our psyches much more than in previous generations and as we engage our shadows as we engage our individual and Collective shadows and submit ourselves to the transforming fire of deep awareness and let the Divine awareness that we all are focus on our past and purify our past of all of those things which hold us back and constrict us we then become initiated into deeper and deeper levels of intimacy with the universe with each other this genius that's behind all these stars and galaxies behind me this is our nature we open ourselves as we purify ourselves we open ourselves into the cosmic arms into the Embrace of our own history into the sacred communion which is taking us forward out of this Century I think is coming a new Humanity the future human you know I call it the birth of the diamond Soul which is simply all of our former lives coming together and fusing into a single intelligence a single Consciousness an individual awareness which is individual and yet a deeper form of individuality than we've ever seen on Earth before not just a few of us all of us the entire human species coming forward in this Crescendo of power purification destabilization reaching out reaching out and achieving something that has never been achieved in history before this is something I share with you which comes from my own psychedelic work but I don't think it's no it has anything to do with me privately I talk with people I think many of us are seeing this basic same truth in our own psychedelic sessions the indigenous people have been seeing it for Generations in their work some of the great Saints and Mystics who never touched psychedelics have seen these things coming forward this is the time of the great unraveling the pandemic unraveled us faster than we ever thought possible but it's just the Overture sure there are harder times coming if we Embrace those hard times with forn knowledge with absolute dedication not turning away from any of the hardship that's coming but engage it fully asking ourselves the question what is the highest good that I can bring to the challenges that I'm facing what can I give that's being asked to be given now I think we accelerate our own individual Evolution and in accelerating our individual Evolution we accelerate Humanity's Collective Evolution I think we're all in this for the collective right now the time of the individual Saints and saviors is gone it's it's over they've done their job they've done their work the hour now is for the children and the grandchildren and our great grandchildren the only the only calling that's worthy of ourselves is our Collective salvation our Collective transformation our Collective good to bring us back in alignment with the Deep truths with our deep soul with our deep heart as the future human emerges in history I anticipate a tremendous opening of our heart to each other as we open our heart to the divine heart which holds all of existence not just humans but all beings all of existence and as our minds open up into the deep communion it opens us up into the cosmic communion that opens us into the intaking of awareness and insights truly scientific insights that can come pouring into us when we're open and clean and clear we've passed the longest night of the year we're coming into the beginning of the rising daylight in our lives just a short cycle just a six-month cycle and then the cycle of Darkness will begin again this challenge that humanity is facing it's a huge challenge we'll make it but that itself is not the end it's just a phase it's just a phase we've been here for billions of years we're going to be here for billions of years more taking us deeper farther unimaginable ways my last thought I share with you tonight is this this journey is so long we're not going to accomplish it in this lifetime it's going to take more than one lifetime many lifetimes to stay on this journey and therefore as we open deeply to the cosmic communion one thing that should fall away quickly is our fear of death absolutely nothing to fear in death because death is in no way an ending it's simply a punctuation on the cycle and the same beautiful universe that we open up in sacred medicine space is the same universe we open up to when we fall when our bodies fall away the journey continues into cascading ecologies of light thank you for letting me share these thoughts with you on this special night thank you so much Chris</p></body></html>

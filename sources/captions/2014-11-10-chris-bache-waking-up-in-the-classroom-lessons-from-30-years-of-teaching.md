imminent experiences in class yet of when mind and body and heart and spirit come together um and I I on a personal level feel really lucky and happy that he's with us this week um I only know a little bit about your history of your life's work so I'll just let you speak that okay and this is ch \[Applause\] come on people let it \[Music\] rip feel how that changed the energy just a little bit I don't have time to \[ __ \] around anymore we don't have time to \[ __ \] around anymore there's just not time it's just only time to get down to the serious stuff so let's get down to it rick asked me to talk about teaching like I've picked up some incalculable secret Knowledge from teaching in Ohio for 30 years I don't know so I'll just tell you what I got and then you can decide whether it was a good thing but uh we're going to have fun tonight no matter what and you know I don't think you wouldn't mind if we kind of finish before 10:00 would you it's been a long day you people have been working hard and for me a talk is simply an excuse to get to the discussion right CU that's where the juice is that's really where the where the good stuff is so I'm just going to kind of lay out some bullets throw out some material to sort of focus our discussion but I'm really hoping we can move quickly enough into some discussion and if that goes really well we'll still be out of here before 10:00 all right up yeah okay is Robert here yet he's coming he's coming there he is finally among his many illustrious Publications he did he one of the ones that you may not come across too often is his beautiful introduction his prologue preface to the living classroom which is a great honor and uh he he really made me look pretty good uh very good it was just honor so this is kind of PCC certified you know and how many people have read this okay all right well I'm going to hit some bullet points on it but I'm going to put it in a larger context I'm I'm going to give you some of the backstory to it all right and I'm just going to talk a little bit about how I came to write this and uh kind of what happened during it and what's it about but this is like my second Saturn return book I mean I started teaching in 79 and this was published in 2008 that's pretty much exactly 29 years and before I was coming up on sabatical because the only time I can this is a little loud doesn't it sound a little loud maybe no okay all right right the only time I can write books is when I'm on sabatical I can write essays before but takes a lot of time to get in deep so before I came up on my last sabatical there were two books that I was thinking about a book on psychedelics and the living classroom and so I went into session space what I usually do when I have an important question and after I was done with the various things I said what should I write and it said definitely the living classroom Because by the time you write the Psychedelic book you're going to be so far out on left field that you know you're going to be beyond the mainstream pale and uh now where you are the living classroom you can do it in a mainstream fashion so I said okay and as soon as I said okay and soon as that I agreed to that and and kind of made the mental intention all sorts of wonderful things began to happen I got some grant money that allowed me to spend more time writing the book and just a lot of wonderful things happened and the living classroom has been published or there have been six excerpts or excerpts or chapters that have been published in five different anthologies it's gotten more AirPlay than any other single thing that I've written and I think it's because of Robert mcdermitt's preface no I think it's because Consciousness Collective fields of Consciousness is an idea that kind of it's bubbling up it's it's time has come we're ripe for it and so as the second Saturn return uh this is a book that the Universe wanted to be written and uh it's basically a summation of the most important things I learned about teaching from my 30 years of teaching uh at Youngstown now another little background when I had my second Saturn return and I came to Youngstown it broke my heart I really didn't want to he here I mean didn't go to seven years of graduate school in order to teach in an an open enrollment undergraduate college about 12, 13,000 students in a in a Rust Belt town in Ohio no graduate students it wasn't my ideal and I tried like anyone with a grain of sense tried desperately to leave for several years because you know when you get out of graduate school and you come to a good graduate school you have a few years when you might jump out into something and I tried jumping problem was I had also encountered Stan's work and I started my own psychedelic work in 79 a year after I started teaching my mind got very quickly radicalized I mean one year I was writing essays on towards a unified theory of metaphor two years later I'm writing essays on the emergence of perinatal symptoms in Buddhist meditations like what happened you know my department was wondering what the hell happened to him they hired a traditional analytic philosopher of religion and linguistic discourse and suddenly I'm really saying hey this guy's on to something seriously good well it wasn't happening you know I religious studies is a very conservative discipline and by the way did you appreciate our dress up for you this is just for you yeah okay it wasn't happening and so that this came to a head four years after I was there four years and there was a the only job that it had opened in 5 years open that year and they decided to go with the very traditional philosophical theological type and I thought ah \[ __ \] and you know when you teach in a at a teaching University where you're really in the classroom a lot you're teaching three courses a quarter nine courses a year plus teaching in the summer this just pounding difficult teaching and I just said okay okay I give up this is not what I wanted but it seems to be what life wants so I surrendered and I said I'm going to become the best teacher I can possibly become I'm not going to fight it I want to work with it let's see what happens let's see where it goes and it went in some very interesting places and the result of what happened basically I was able to put down in this book and onethird of this book is my students one third of it at the back third of it really it's a second book are essays that my students have written over the years and just beautiful beautiful essays and there were hidden reasons I learned later for what I was in Youngstown and I'll get to those in a bit and there were some benefits of being there because if you don't have a lot of graduate students and you don't have a lot of responsibility for that level you can do a lot of exploration you can do a lot of things so if I ever wanted to learn something I just said I'll teach a seminar on it and I was teaching a lot of courses and things that lay outside my discipline and I just kind of learned I learned a lot of things and as I went through and I was able to do a lot of innovation in the uh in our curriculum I taught a lot of what I call transpersonal studies you know near-death episode research reincarnation research out of- Body Research I taught transpersonal psychology of religion I taught lots of seminars and Stan gr's work so you know there's a certain there were some benefits there were some tradeoffs and one of the great benefits was non-traditionally aged students about 40% of our students are non-traditionally aged and that was a nice compensation for not having graduate students because they were you know they were much more seriously engaging in their studies than the 18 19 year old kind of might be but the other thing that Youngstown gave me was an opportunity for deep spiritual practice here something you know there's not much to do in Ohio it's kind of boring you know and you know watch the corn and watch the corn you know so it's just kind of a nice contemplative smooth environment if you want to do deep serious work and so I wanted I found out I wanted to do deep serious work so I started my psychedelic work right when I started my career and I did four intense years and then I stopped for six years and then I did another and 10 years after that now I love teaching I've always loved teaching I've always liked to gab but I tell you teaching open enrollment University it's Frontline teaching I mean this the kids who didn't this first time they anyone in their family's gone to college a lot of people pulling them down telling why do you want to go to college for you know just get a job at GM Lordstown make cars you know it's what I you have to do what I call full contact teaching this is take no prisoners full contact teaching you have to provide the mo motivation you have to kick him in the butt you have to slap them around it is like when I come here to teach man you guys are so easy you're so motivated you're already you know it's like you want to learn these things you're there in Ohio it's a it's a different game and so they make you work for it and I work for it I'm willing to work for it and eventually my classroom became I began to think of it like a dojo you know it's like you're on my mat no one's going to get hurt but you're going to hit the floor a few times and it's like I don't have time to \[ __ \] around you know let's get down to it so 30% of my students who sign up the first day they drop out by the end of the first week and I make it real clear just to get credits in the humanities is a perfectly good reason to be here the first day it's not a good reason to be here the second day cuz it's easier play ways to get the credit but I also then try to show them what we can do show them a sense of where we can go if you're willing to work and I find that they're willing to work if you give them a quality product they're willing to work with you because they're they really they've been damaged often in their High School they've been hurt they've been crimped they don't have high expectations they you know they're not at Oberlin they're not at Yale they have kind of low expectations if you give them the promise of something substantive they'll work their ass off for you and they'll open their heart if you allow them to and go there but when you start to psychedelics and you make the choice to work with psychedelics you kind of have to make some adjustments in your professional life I had to split my life in two I had a professional life where I did the things that you do as a professor and you do all the traditional things you serve in the committees and you do this and you do that and you publish and then I had my personal life where I was doing the graian Deep psychotherapeutic work and you can't let those two blend in the classroom this is not CIS right the good people of Ohio do not like to hear that their professors are dropping massive quantities of acid so you keep those two separate so I didn't talk about my work in front of my to my classes I mean my own faculty members it was like 10 years before they really got a an idea of what was going on I mean every when I would do a session I was kind of so poor as a beginning faculty member I had to borrow the tape player from one of my colleagues he began to get a sense of what was going on but you don't talk about it you just I didn't talk about it for years because these were kept separate in the physical world it ended up producing some very interesting complications or Consequences that taught me a great deal about the nature of Consciousness because as we're going to see Consciousness did not split itself even though I split my world the world of mind is not dividable in that way and there were some things that happened that began to make those things be connected but there were also some personal consequences I'll come back around later about when you split yourself like this and you own you you cannot be your whole and complete self in every circumstance and you kind of know what you're doing going in but I didn't really understand what the some of the long-term ramifications of that would be down the way so this is what began to happen early in my teaching student asked me a question you know after you've taught a course 3 or four years is you pretty much have heard most of the questions that undergraduates are going to ask so soon as I ask a question your mind starts running with an answer this time I just stopped and I thought among all the possible answers that I could give which what could I say that would be most in tune to this student and my mind kind of stopped and suddenly I had an image of a door in the back of my mind and a piece of paper passed through it and I read the piece of paper and it was an idea it was an idea an answer that i' never given to that particular question so I just okay let's try this I ran with it and it h the magic happened teaching happened uh the students eyes lit up other people's eyes lit up the energy went up in the room something good happened so I thought okay I and I really prepare I mean I bring it look I even brought notes to eln I prepare my classes I have a lot of notes I really work them through and I keep on track with my syllabus I know where I'm going to be in the 12th week in a course you know cuz I otherwise you anyway I really prepare for it but that little door in the back of my mind gave me a a teaching about integrating improvisational intuition with data with my prepared work so I began to pay attention to that door in the back of my mind and to work with it and when I did you know something happened in the room that didn't happen when I just kind of stayed in my prepared script and then time passed I kept on doing my psychedelic work and if you've read those of you who read dark night early Dawn you kind of know it you know I dropped into some pretty pretty deep stuff pretty quickly and really was engaging deep deep uh Collective Dynamics and and entering Hill Realms and the ocean of suffering I talk about and so it was pretty intense but wherever I was on Saturday Monday morning I was back in the classroom doing my job and it was really that was a commitment I would not let my personal work get in the way of my professional work I had a major commitment for my students and then one day when it was just an ordinary day I've been doing my ordinary thing teaching intro Eastern intra World teaching psychology religion or transpersonal studies this was actually an intro Eastern course a student came up after class after he was sure that the room was empty and no one would hear what he had to say and he said it's funny that you would use that example that you used in class today cuz that's exactly what happened to me this week and he told me a story and it was right it's like I had quoted his life story so that's interesting you know okay a little synchronistic you know but I never thought of myself as being psychically sensitive I always sort of think of myself as being kind of brickish in that way I'm a psychic brick I don't have those type of things some people do I always en Envy those people who have like I was 12 years old when I had my first mystical experience I said oh lucky you but it's not me so I kind of you know I was trained to brush this stuff off but then a few weeks later it happened again somebody came up and said you know that's exactly what happened to my mother and to make a long story short the deeper my psychedelic work progressed the more frequently this began to happen people were finding pieces of their personal life showing up in my lectures and I wasn't intending it and I wasn't conscious of doing it I would just be reaching for an example to illustrate a point and something was connecting me to them and I was like reaching into their life and putting it forward now if you're in a room just looking for three credits or four credits in the humanities and you're in the back of the room with your baseball cap on backwards and you're just kind of in time when all of a sudden the professor is using your life to illustrate a point being made how could you not take that as a personal invitation how could you not have yourself snapped to attention this began to happen not a lot but often enough that it kind of became a pretty semi-regular thing in my classroom and then the plot deepened when I began to go into deeper and deeper territory when I got into the deep ocean of suffering death rebirth at the collective level where you're just dealing with massive currents it's like you're not dealing with the Nearshore currents you're dealing with the big tidal flows in the collective psyche and you're getting into deep deep Collective death rebirth meltdowns I found that my students were being drawn deeper and deeper into deep existential crisis in their own lives it was like we we were all part of one giant massive coex meltdown system addictions were bottoming out bad marriages or weak marriages were being forced into you know grow or die situations uh people were having suddenly unearthing uh sexual abuse and I don't talk about sexual abuse but something was bringing to the surface deep pains in their life I can't emphasize enough that this was not my intention in fact as this thing began to happen I began to even try to slow it down because it did not feel like I didn't understand it so I couldn't control it it was happening he like how do you ensure informed consent in a process which is so involuntary I even put on my syllabus one time I put uh caution taking this course may be dangerous to your psychological equilibrium the students thought I was being cute this thing I called it the magic I you know the magic happened uh I'd come home and I'd say to my wife the magic happened today you know I was just doing my stuff and Bam all of a sudden this lightning bolt came out of nowhere and blasted somebody apart and all of a sudden we're having this intense conversation after class and they're like they're moving something's moving in their life I I I began to sort of function like a lightning rod you know there was something Spark working and at that time I didn't understand really what was going on I knew it had something to do with my psychedelic work but I really wasn't prepared for the enormity of the implications of the paradigm shift that I was going to have to make and eventually did make to understand how this happened and by the way uh everything that's in the living classroom I mean I had been thinking about it and wrestling with it some but it all dropped in intact complete in one psychedelic session all the fundamental structure and it what it's what gave me seeing it clearly in that space is what gave me the courage of my convictions to articulate it so that it because if it's happening to me I knew it had to be happening to other people and it's not really about psychedelics if I were using any type of spiritual practice that had the capacity or any that to drop you deep into the collective psyche and into that territory if you open up at that level then you're naturally going to generate a kind of a an energetic shock wave which is going to touch the lives of people that you have karmic connection to and I'm a teacher so I have a lot of karmic connections to my students this is does if you're a business person if you're a researcher if you're a chore phographer if you're working in the world and you're embedded in a network of relationships and you go deep into that level see the mind the universe doesn't necessarily from one perspective it doesn't recognize individuals it's like the weather it doesn't really recognize individual atoms or molecules of you know oxygen and whatnot it's like there's that side of it going it just goes so I began to realize that I was teaching on two levels at campus there was something began to happen at one level and for the most of the students I was just an ordinary Professor I was teaching the stuff and they came and our relationship was about information exchange and they mostly left pretty happy but there was a second group of students who began to take pretty much all the courses I would teach and they were here because just being in my classes began to be a source of transformation in their lives they were here for the energy or something they knew that something was positively moving in their life when we came together to work and again it wasn't my intention eventually I this I began to realize that there is an energetic resonance this is just it's nothing Supernatural or paranormal it's just normal it's just natural life is like that Consciousness is like that minds are like that we it's just an illusion of the physical senses that our minds are fundamentally separate well they are but there's that other side where the you know individual Minds emerge out of a unified field of mind and when you come together and you focus intention there is a natural sharing that takes place and if one of you is working at a very deep level then the universe seizes that opportunity to awaken and to heal other beings it's not something I was doing it was something that the Universe was doing almost in spite of me you know okay teaching is information transfer and all that magic that you do you know in the dance of the dance but underneath that teaching involves the direct engagement of mind and mind in the unified field of Mind clarified States Of Consciousness are contagious you cannot help it it cannot help it it just happen negative states are also contagious but clarified states of consciousness are contagious our spiritual ecology simply does not allow private realization if you're beginning to wake up there's an energetic quality component of waking up people around you begin to wake up and if you're a teacher or you're in anything that works people where you're working with groups you have to be prepared for that consequence for that implication in fact you cannot stop it there may be a reason why people do this work in monasteries on mountains far away because it kind of buffers you know but if you're going to do this work in the world you have to be prepared to handle the implications or the consequences of this natural process and here's the thing by the way the better teacher you are the more powerful this will this will happen you know because teaching is that Magical Mystery you know it's that resonance I mean you're really you're working communication you're trying to organize intention you're in the dance and if you're good at that well then that just makes it easier for this stuff to happen So eventually I had no recourse but I I had to learn what was happening I had to understand what it means to teach at this level what time is it oh okay wow okay what does it mean to teach when your person has kind of become the add some kind of added Catalyst into the room it's not just the ideas that are the Catalyst but your person has become the Catalyst I had to learn how to manage not control but to manage the energies that were involved how to make it more efficient how to protect the students how to how to just how to choreograph how to choreograph it a little bit and I began to realize it wasn't just what was happening in the room was really too big to be understood simply in terms of an energetic resonance between my spiritual practice and my students that was part of what was going on but then I began to realize there was something else going on students were beginning to show up in each other's dreams there was something happening socially in the room what what was happening was simply I began to understand what it was too big and too powerful simply to be explainable in terms of some just a a one-on-one resonance between me and them there was a second Dynamic that was moving on moving in the room now I had read Rupert sheldrake you know his books uh a new science of life and the presence of the past and The Rebirth of nature ID read his books I understood the concept of morphogenetic resonance and morphic FS but rert is working in very very big fields long you know historical evolutionary fields and I didn't see the relevance of those giant feels to what was happening in my classroom because we were together for 15 weeks at a time that's not a whole lot of time but then I again in this one particular psychedelic session suddenly I saw Oh you mean short-term groups have generate feels feels are generated whenever people gather together and the more focused they are in intention and if they're together long enough and deeply engaged enough and this very important if the if the group is repeated if it's a repetition that goes on these fields emerge now they emerge out of the unified nature of con ious that Consciousness is a inherently unified field so it's not like an Erector Set where you're connecting you're putting two pieces that are really separate linking them together it's kind of like that but but at a deeper level what's happening is an underlying potential is being is being brought is being sparked into form group feels group mind Phil Jackson not a very mystical guy as far as I know but coach of the Los Angeles Lakers right he sees it he says we see this a lot in critical situations when players are totally focused on the team goal their effort can create chain reactions it's as if they become totally connected to one another in sync with one another like five fingers on one hand right now Howard Bloom great author wonderful book the global brain he wrote In other words without knowing it individuals form a team Even in our most casual moments we pulse in synchrony isn't that a wonderful phrase We pulse in synchrony other symptoms of this being a field phenomenon I began to realize that uh there was just like rert sheldrake's theory predicts there was a change in the learning curve taking place in my classes it's kind of like it this is too simple but it's almost as if one class was starting where the last class stopped is it wasn't quite like that but you know you got a a a a course scripted you have it kind of worked out you know it's a winner you've refined it you've spent several years polishing it you know you're taking them A to B to C to D you walk in the class the first day and all of a sudden they're giving you acces that they're already in B they're already in C and you've got to rearrange your entire syllabus or you've got to make an you've got to step up because something has shifted they've moved I began to realize there was a learning that was taking place in one class between semesters there was some kind of Developmental process and you you go through certain turning points all of a sudden things are stable and then something triggers and every class in that subject after that you're working in a different context and that's a pain in the ass to have to rearrange your syllabus so once in a while it's like I'm not going to do that I'm going we're going to stay with the tried and true all that's bad news that's doesn't work because yeah the students get bored and the energy in the room and then you spend so much time trying to lift up the energy and it's like no it's better to go with it find where they are because if you find them it's not that you'll do a better job teaching but there's there's something that they're giving you in where they are they're going to take you places that you haven't been before yourself I began to differentiate two different levels of these fields so there's the class field I call and then the course field the class field is created by the energy of the people who are in the room today all right it's kind of like in a a tree if there many many rings of a tree the uh the outer ring the what is the not the cambium ring what's the outer ring of the of the tree called I'm I'm blanking on it sorry having a brain fart you know the living outer edge of the tree not the bark right underneath the bark pardon vascular cambi cambium okay that's the class field all right the course field is a much older bigger field it's the energy it's a kind of a residual Arc in the learning of the field which has been contributed to by every student who has ever taken this course with this particular Professor now I'm going to kind of restrict it to that with this particular Professor I think it's more than that but in the beginning the class field may be the stronger field but over time when the course field when you've been teaching 20 30 more years the course field gets very strong so here you've got three systems the individual student whose Consciousness is being affected by the class field whose Consciousness is being affected by the course field so here You' got the universal mind the individual and what we're suggesting is that this organic relationship ship between universal mind and individual mind has these intermediate feels which when those feels are get strong and when they are skillfully focused as you can then it triggers it animates it empowers it makes more creative more adventuresome the learning of the individual mind if you were coach we'd be talking about performance Fields if we were Physicians we'd be talking about healing fields I'm a teacher so we're talking about learning feels but feels is feels okay old feels young feels present feels past feels I learned that you could work with these fields I learned some tricks uh I start working with the feels of a class before the class begins there are certain practices that I do because to me the field is the unregister student in the room right they it's a tangible thing I even will so far go so far as when I'm looking at which books to assign a semester from now I sometimes try to tune into the feel that's emerging around this course to determine whether I should use go to a or go with b i do certain kinds of practices spiritual practices because I I don't want a lot of old Karma screwing things up in the classroom I don't want a lot of bad vibe from you mean because you know I'm a reincarnationist I believe in reincarnation you we I think you know life being what it is I'm assuming I've got former lives with some of my students I'm assuming that sometimes it worked out well and we got something good that came out of it sometimes maybe it didn't work out too well we got some bruises or some pain that's going to come up we I don't have any time for the bad stuff so I do these practices it's like I'm sorry if I hurt you without the students knowing this is something you don't do to them I'm sorry if I hurt you please forgive me if you hurt me I forgive you let's just go let's just get on with it and there are practices you can do every spiritual tradition has practices for cutting the cords of karma karma I used to use a Hawaiian Kahuna practice calledo which means cutting and then later when I learn CH which is a Tibetan practice which also means cutting I would do that practice so before class begins when I get a roster which usually comes in about a month before the class begins I'm doing chud with this roster with the students in front of me I've often wondered what my faculty colleagues would think if they came in and I'm doing a bell and ringing a and I'm singing a Tibetan prayer for students in a class that hasn't even begun yet but once you understand feels this is simply just being efficient it's just being efficient you're working with the energy before there are physical beings present once the class begins then you get to see the beings that are physically the embodiment of the energy that you've been picking up on and you can work with feels during the class you can do it behind the scenes and there ways in which you can do it in the class visualization exercises can Empower Fields various types of Cafe conversations can cross fertilize Fields one of the other things that's important to do is to close the field at the end of the semester now by closing the field I don't mean like you dissolve the field but there's a sense in which every class has a beginning a middle and an end it's important if you're going to empower Fields And if you're going to work with fields and you're you're going to invite that type of dynamic into the room it's important at the end of the semester to close the field and help students detach from the field to re-empower them as individual Learners and then send them on their way where they will now go on to new fields and connect with new groups and then go on to new fields and connect to new you don't want to encourage a an attachment to the field but if you don't close the field sometimes students get stuck they'll show up at your office two weeks after course is over kind of wanting to talk and what's I began to realized there was something wrong here it wasn't just that they liked the course but they were still psychically attached to to the energy of the class but they didn't have a place to take it and so you have to do things both shamanic and strategically pedagogically to close the field so that like a final exam is a good way to help close the field let them demonstrate their learning whenever you have a kind of a a beer or a pizza at the local uh Student Union at the end of a course you're always are asking what's what are you going to do next where are you going next what's next on the agenda you're you're focusing you collect information on the course you get student feedback in the course and you tell them I'm going to use your feedback to make this better for the next class you're reinforcing the sense that they are part of a a lineage of learning and their time is over and that's okay everybody our time together is fin night waking up in the classroom waking up right we're talking about you know some type of Spiritual Awakening what do we mean what is that waking up simply is in in one perspective it's simply waking up to the simple fact that nobody holds their own being in and of itself the beginnings and ending of our being lie outside of ourselves there's just there is no it's it's waking up to the tangible fact that uh we our lives are deeply intertwined and woven together and if you can stand in a certain way you can feel that weave and when you feel that weave strongly that chronic sense of tightness of the self relaxes and the wind blows through the trees and the leaves dance is just waking up waking up to something that has always been there it didn't start it doesn't stop you don't make it happen it's just the natural condition of being the bubble pops shunyata right emptiness emptiness of self but the translation of shunyata that I like the best is transparency transparency it's like I'm here but everyone's here but we become transparent to the ground condition we become transparent to the true condition of things people wake up in all sorts of circumstances and all sorts of activities with all sorts of context and one outside of my own psychedelic work one of of the places where I've experienced this simple simple truth very deeply is in the classroom you know when something uses my mind or uses me and there is this wind that blows invisibly between the students and myself or between us together and that and that delicious feeling of being used where you just kind of relax and something happens which is bigger than you oh there's no self here there's no self in in it this is something which is inherently trans self phenomena and when you when you just appreciate the trans self nature of this exchange the joy of discovering that the life that is alive in you the life that's moving in this room is actually the life of all things it is the life of all things your life and their life your life it's the life of all things relaxing into that even when we forget even when I forget life doesn't forget life is still one the transparency is still there whether or not I'm remembering it or not whether I'm a paying pay attention to or not it's always there it's just there waking up you can wake up in any circumstance in any condition and it's lovely to wake up when you're working as a in the classroom it's just why not the circle of learning I had had the experience many times I'm sure you have two you go through an exercise you go through an experience you read a book you learn something very quickly a few days later a week later somebody asked you a question in class if they had asked you two weeks before you wouldn't have anything to say because you don't didn't know that but because they asked you now you have something to say and you you give it to them and they it's important to them and you think wow Isn't that cool something is alive in the universe it's able to use something that I learned in order to help somebody somebody else that is just got to be damn cool that's neat uh but then I began to realize yeah you know I don't quite I haven't seen this all work out yet it's much more comp complicated than that it's not simply that something that I learned is being used by the universe to facilitate a learning in somebody else it's actually often the reason I learned this in the first place the reason I had this experience in the first place is because there was a a need to know coming at me and my system picked up the need to know and I had the ability to learn so that when this happened when this need came forward The Exchange took place the circle of learning and when I began to realize it that this was happening all the time it was all it had been happening for decades before I even understood it that's when you really have to let go big time because you don't even own your career you don't even own your own academic ideas your own academic passions your passion and your students passion are intertwined right from the very beginning and that's when you either clutch and get real tight on it and try to get back in control of it or you let go very very deeply and you begin to just this the beginnings and endings of your life do not start and stop with you the reason you want the things you want the reasons you love the things you love the reasons that you just have the hungers that you have are not independent of the loves and hungers and the wishes that other people people have we're just constantly processing these things at multiple levels all at the same time now that's a dance isn't that it's just a dance well I kept doing the Psychedelic work I kept going deeper and deeper I began to get into you know things I haven't written about publicly yet you know dark night early Dawn takes the first 10 years but there's a second 10 years deep stuff stuff that many of you have touched and worked in to experience reincarnation not as an in not at the soul level not at the individual level but at the aggregate level to experience what it's like to be an speci that's reincarnating so that every individual is like sloughing cells off of skin this massive magnificent beautiful organism learning the learning of the species mind Generation by generation billions of people beginning to be drawn into the larger story of Humanity's evolutionary pivot it going into vast tracks of time being drawn into the crisis as fermenting underneath history bringing us into this boiling point going beyond the boiling point to see what's what's being generated what has been being in the works for 100,000 years from and this Crescendo that we're moving to in some ways can you imagine what it would be like to go through pregnancy and labor and not know what a what a child was in some ways what we're going through only really for me began to make sense when I began to get a a taste of the human that's coming the human that we're all in the process of gestating through history and then to be enter into some of the domains that I've called the the domain of diamond Luminosity or that the Buddhists call it Samba kayas best as I can determine this deep deep intimacies with the Divine intimacies so deep they eventually become became for me too painful to leave just too painful I couldn't keep going back into them I could not share this knowledge with my students I didn't talk about my work but I was always teaching stand stuff so there was a sense in which I could could teach through Stan but eventually my work reached and tapped into territory I could not bring that to them even though they were willing they just didn't have sufficient preparation they were undergraduate students in Ohio they were not graduate students in California you I could not bring that to them them and something began to happen inside my body because my natural being is to share but I could not share these things that meant so deep to me I had knowledge that I could not bring forward I had to stop myself from bringing it Forward I began to lose control of my voice I I began to there was so much tension in my voice because someone would ask a question and inside me there would come this knowing that would naturally want to reach out and share but I couldn't so I'd clutch and i' I'd lose control of my voice and there'd be kind of a bark it's kind of embarrassing it's kind of a bark and I'd stop it was getting pretty intense this was when my work was really getting to the peak stages in 97 98 99 I stopped it in 99 I really didn't know how to where this was going to go and then a number of things happened in my personal life uh my marriage ended uh dark night early Dawn was published and then I was given an opportunity to come to be the director of education at ions and uh so I thought okay took care of my family I mean the worst experience of my life was going through that divorce taking care of my former wife taking care of my children moving them getting everything situated working that beginning of that healing process but then I went to California and I thought ah this will be the new platform this will give me I I'm out of Ohio I'm out of teaching undergraduates I'm going to be able to work with more people who are already through Class A B and C we can start at D you know this is going to be a new platform for me and it it was kind of initially but 2 years later it didn't work out for a variety of reasons don't need to go into really did not want to stay there and I came back to Ohio and I resumed my teaching career which is a hard transition to go through I knew I didn't belong at YSU anymore in Youngstown anymore but this is where I had to be because I had to get my kids through college I I had TW college tuitions to go I really couldn't step away until my youngest graduated from college and that was still a number of years off so I kind of you know adjusted I had stopped the intense psychedelic work I my system was beginning to slow down but I knew that something wasn't right I mean I was really ungrounded I was really I had developed an over attachment to marijuana you know I I just I began to realize part of me just was not willing to come down off the mountain and my smoking was keeping me from coming all the way down all the way down off the mountain and I realized I had to come completely down off the mountain and that took that took some time it took 5 to 10 years after I stopped my work before my whole system kind of re-calibrated down to the new Baseline soon as my daughter graduated from college I resigned from YSU and then the question becomes how do not how do I share what I know now and so I it's by writing you know it's by writing and wonderful opportunity to spend some time with you I mean it's just what you are such a blessing to me really such a blessing your hearts and your minds are so beautiful a damn how do I contribute to the Resurgence the renewal of the Psychedelic Renaissance how do I personally contribute to my discipline how do I help them realize the potential of psychedelics for Philosophy for my original discipline how do I bring that forward how can I help others tap into the cosmology The cosmological Depths that they are already deeply part of without exposing themselves to some of the risk and making some of the mistakes that I made along the way knowing when to pull back knowing when when to stop knowing when the students whom you love and I love being with the students I love being in the classroom but knowing when those are not my students anymore I can't keep doing this pulling back and then writing you know writing and then seeing what happens seeing what comes from there so the book now I'm working on is stealing diamonds from Heaven which is this whole story and then I have another one I want to work on called the birth of the diamond Soul which is really about my sense of what's happening in history and nature okay not bad 9:00 right on pretty damn good huh okay I'm done let's stand up unkink your ankles and your knees okay well let here here for Chris \[Applause\] anybody going to say nobody's I'll say something okay go I think you can see why I was so delighted and uh to write the forward to Christ's book and how easy it was to tell you the truth so thank you and for those any of you who are interested in continuing this conversation with Chris or with me with various parts of what what you're doing and it's important to see us um I would be happy to participate maybe even while we're here we could figure that out okay that's good okay that's possible pull up a cushion okay um I I don't know if any of you going to be leaving I have a this is really be breaking the mood wouldn't it save it for later we save it for later okay I do have an announcement for later but let's save it till the discussion okay okay anybody who wants to leave at any time yeah please do yeah but um I mean I'm very moved by Chris as you could tell um and if you read the forward you'll see that it was it was an easy affirmation to make now what most of you don't know is that I was Robert sitter in a holotropic breath work session right down at the big house when we and he was my sitter we got down together okay floor is open let's talk okay um so yeah maybe I'll begin with a little explanation why I jumped up here oh good um so you said you did young child for 30 years and 33 33 yeah well I I had a very similar experience for 20 years at Peru College yeah where I taught all my my students were first generation yeah um I taught four I never had fewer than 40 students I never taught the same student twice I taught 40 students three times a year three times a day MH uh each semester for 20 years yeah so it's a little something then I come to Paradise um not as a faculty member initially but I've now been a fac fa member for 14 years mhm all the time looking for the kind of experience that you described and either I well I I I'm the brick that you said you were uh but so I didn't have all those things I also didn't have a whole psychedelic uh practice we can fix that we there's no shortage of people in this room or prepared at a moment's notice to get me on their team that said I want to say that in this psychedelically uh inspired Community neither has it ever happened that a person pressured me not once yeah that's the way it's supposed to be of course it is but it isn't always in life but it it is the case okay so um so I'm always looking for the kind of what I call the etheric body yeah to be experienced and shared with language and examples and whatever and I'm not saying it doesn't happen or it hasn't happened it certainly has not happened at the level that you described in the in the uh living classroom which I think is quite an amazing document if you haven't read it it's an amazing document um so I just wanted to take I jumped up here very spontaneously or you you field uh go up uh to right um to uh I actually had a pretty hard trip if you remember yeah in fact everybody was out of the room I don't know why I'm talking about this everybody was out of the room and uh Stan relieved you yeah and when I came out of this experience I assisted to assisted to Chris that was about 10 minutes uh it was actually 3 hours and uh there was a hand that I recall experiencing something like a basball glove mhm which was Stan's hand on my face that went from here all the way up and this giant of a mountain of a man with exquisite gentle comp comp passionate quality yeah right uh I almost I was you know I had this opportunity to talk at at the conference I almost said that but I said no it's not really what it's about but it's in my mind because we just had this great experience of of Chris of sorry Stan so anyway we had that together I for you that's right so it's a very bonding experience to have have this um the other time I did it was in uh my house and uh Ashbury Street uh with will keeping well he's good you're in great hands yeah I know I stopped I went to the mountain twice yeah uh but anyway getting back to you and your work and your relationship to our students which is quite intense considering that you don't teach that often yeah right it's quite intense I hear yeah get him here keep him here that kind of thing uh which I listen to and remember and try to be you know do what we can um but keep keep it up keep it up uh let me mention something about the etheric field this comes at the very end of the living classroom because the living classroom was written in published in 2008 written in 2006 7 and I stopped the heavy duty psychedelic work in 99 over time this energetic residence calmed down it didn't go away entirely but instead of kind of kind of being like a lightning rod where it was happening around me without my being you know now I had to kind of cooperate with it I had to kind of let it happen not like I could control it but there was a sense of it's a it was a subtler thing and that kind of teaches us something about the etheric level that the practice empowers the the system you open up you bringing in heavy duty energy you move from 110 volts to 240 volts naturally you're going to act activate these inherent circuits but then if you if the system calms down it's not like the circuits the network is there but you're not there's not as much energy driving it and that's there's a wisdom in the kind of the pace of evolution there is a certain not a risk I think I mean potentially but there is a certain if you over if you drive the system hard things are going to happen then you calm down things calm down you know so I don't have that transparency today that I did at the peak in the living classroom and now it's kind of a subtler thing than it was then add something yeah I don't really talk about um rules are rules rules are rules um you know the period of the greatest transparency as you described it was that whole period of the Uranus Neptune conjunction which was indeed a field a collective field that did exactly that uh you know dissolving of boundaries the creation of transparent Fields it's a per perfect expression of it in a very creative way and it was you know it basically um you know started coming in in the mid to late ' 80s and then was just totally cooking all through the 9s and then um you know once it got to 2001 it reached the 15 Dee Mark and and you know that pulse that you know PCC was born under and uh many other I mean now we've got the Uranus Pluto and a whole another kind of driving intensity is here uh but what you were describing of the living classroom and the morphic field that was Tak in and these these fields these coarse fields these class Fields Etc um it's a it's larer both the perception and the capacity to uh cultivate it and the capacity to name it and articulate it very much I think is an expression of that that larger uh Uranus Neptune um very the privilege that we all had come to to have had that going all all during those years yeah yeah thank you so where are we going Chris um Richard Chris I um I just want to express my deepest gratitude um for some of us that have experienced your in a classroom and see the living embodiment of your written word in person it is unbelievable to be in the presence and I feel every time I leave the classroom I feel um just a little bit more dignified and um connect to a larger purpose in life and um on a personal note like five or six weeks ago I started teaching poetry to sixth and seventh graders and I was terrified in front of those kids um I felt like I didn't even know how to speak to kids and um if it wasn't for um for your book I think I would have fallen apart because I I had this distinct feeling um with the help of your book that not all responsibility laid on my my shoulders and I could actually just allow the field to um create the class and sure enough it happened and I saw it in In Living Action yeah so I do I do have a question that I want to add to this little um note and that is what what cosmological implications do you see um from the field experience that you have made in your life that the whole universe seems to relate and that potential to create Fields everywhere we look yeah um as a Galaxy a kind of field like that and um any thoughts well the nice thing about it is it was working just fine for hund it's been working this way for billions of years before we began to understand what was going on so whatever is going on it's been going on for a hell of a long time the fact that we're beginning to understand some of these Dynamics and maybe can participate in them more consciously some people actually some of my colleagues have said you know well this is kind of like uh it undermines your individuality you know you all this kind of ego fear kind of stuff but it's like look we're just beginning to play with something that's been playing with us for a long time so I don't know I don't know how it all works you know I don't know the full ramifications of all these Dynamics it's just that look when we just kind of work together we synchronize ourselves we work with guided intention we want focused intention we do these exercis together what do you know there's a little bit of bleed through that comes together a little reinforcement that takes place hey then it get scary you think about well there's a field around the Pentagon there's a field around shopping malls there's a field around the New York Times there's a field around all you know there's so fields are everywhere there's they're not good or bad they're they not moral just moral things there's negative there's a field around the cluc clux clan there's a field around the NRA and all the chapters of the NRA but it's been going on for a long time it's just the connective tissue of Consciousness man reaching sort of threshold proportion it but once you understand that then you kind of begin to be a little bit more sensitive to your own psychic hygiene you don't want to put yourself in certain psychic Fields because yeah yeah you know I was like I used to take my kids to karate matches and oh man it's like it's like you know it's just kind of you know but going to an art museums that's kind of a nice field you know so it's why did you say as I think you did that uh they're not good or bad but you just you just indicated that some Fields really are pretty negative and difficult by good good or bad I mean nature isn't making is doesn't seem to be at least I don't think of nature as rein is in this particular respect reinforcing morally good feels and undermining morally injurious feels or negative feels now I as an evolving Consciousness want I choose to cultivate certain energy in my life and by choosing if I want to cultivate that energy then I kind of want to detach from this energy so I may make moral distinctions and I may want to associate myself with fields of compassion intelligence creativity and and not put myself in in the context of intense competition you know corrosive vitriolic feels but it's kind of like you know the oan has currents the ocean has rip tides the ocean moves one way or the other it we drown or we float but they're not moral so we have um two differences in our worldview okay that I've surfaced in the last few minutes okay you might be interested uh one is for me uh this entire discussion takes place in a uh comprehensive evolution of Consciousness yes if we since we all we all here mostly all here for Rick's talk just remember what he was saying about the uniqueness of the modern Western Consciousness well that uh what that fact uh that Rick is so good at articulating but he and I both influenced by own bfield saving the appearances and many books like that MH uh uh leads me to say that to you for your comment that um something like the etheric uh was uh immediately uh evident uh without the separation came about in the modern West and so now we are in a situation where we have to learn I think by love to reconnect with our our etheric and the etheric that surrounds us in a way that we we do try to discern aetheric fields which may be synonymous tological okay that are working against love and we have to know that they are and do what we can to transform them I'll go even further than that I agree with you great I think I think the universe you know Jung said the universe tilts towards growth right right so I think there are ways and levels of the universe that's actually encouraging the forces of compassion and tilting it towards growth but when can I say that the feels themselves are natural phenomena that are not in themselves good or bad they just are that doesn't mean that there aren't other dynamics that are at play which are encouraging the emergence or strengthening in subtle ways perhaps feels of compassion which are feels of Oneness which are feels of growth and kind of uh not giving as much support to feels which are inherently divisive and inherently destructive of the unified fabric of life I think I I think I would want to revise your language just a little bit okay uh because I'm not I don't often talk about anything inherently without adding its Rel its multiple relationships yes so I don't think that fields are uh negative all by themselves they're negative in relation to something that the universe needs to accomplish that's interesting language I have to sit with that for a bit uh okay let me sit with that for a bit I like that in relationship that they have to accomplish okay let me sit with that for a bit I mean young to tends towards growth or siner talks about uh the universe is trying to evolve towards love and freedom yeah I actually think it's towards love and freedom is only the shouldn't say only is the uh condition which makes makes love possible yeah to me love is is an expression of the inherent Oneness of life and it is it is it Fosters it it expresses it and that's why it's so powerful it's it is the experience of the inherent unified nature of reality you know yeah and therefore those fields that are emphasizing and militating on behalf of disunity and fear hatred and delusion uh I consider to be negative and to be um and that it's part of my life to try to transform those fields which uh I also Advance against what I think of myself yeah I I certainly agree with you on that I mean you know I just a little side note Youngstown one of the reasons I learned that I was in Youngstown particularly short very quick bullet my it was my soul's choice to do the work with the ocean of suffering that I ended up doing for all those years in the Psychedelic work San Francisco is not a very good environment in which to deal with those kind of negative feels Youngstown is a very very good environment to to deal with those kind of negative feels Youngstown has made the the cover of Time Magazine twice as Mobtown USA had the highest murder per capita rate in the country for a number of years and it goes the mafia dominated Youngstown politics for many years lots of Gangland executions and it goes all the way back to the Native Americans where some terrible massacres took place there so there's a field a huge kind of psychic field a lot of Eastern European immigration a lot of patriarchy a lot of abusive women it's really kind of it's it's a place where Bad Karma comes to work itself out uh and so I I believe in working to lift those feels lift those energies out of the collective psyche and I you know so I I affirm that very very deeply but when I so when I say that the fields themselves I mean the aggregation of that negativity is a natural phenomenon that I don't mean it's a I don't mean to affirm it as a natural therefore good it's it's an aggregation of energy which is natural how about intelligible intelligible okay Wendy wants to get in I'm sorry go s me how' you like a job oh yeah I've taken it already good it be the Somers saw from now on \[Laughter\] yeah oh thank you Chris for coming and sharing with us it was beautiful to see you speak so freely and um express everything you want to express and and articulate it very well thank you my question my curiosity in working with Fields is um comes with the idea of I I I think about the the form of an atom and how the electron jumps from ring to ring um with no time taken yeah and and with that idea as a kind of a model for how the universe is structured yeah I was curious to hear what you would have to say about conscious the evolution of Consciousness in a relational field and Quantum leaps in that field I don't know I mean we know about emergence we we know that you know things happen things jump uh we hit tipping points we think we're coming to a Tipping Point an evolutionary Tipping Point uh when people have near-death experiences they go through these exponential increases in Awareness in a very short period of time and more than one author is suggested that the human race is coming to a collective near-death experience a potential jumping point uh if Fields come to tipping points in small groups you know my in dark night early Dawn I I suggest that we have a long way to go and very little time to get there and I suggest that the only way we could possibly make it as far evolutionary wise is we have to go is if we understand field Dynamics because from field Dynamics we're not trying to change 7 billion Minds we're only trying to change one mind and the 7 billion experiences are being processed at an integral level and so uh if we understand nonlinear systems and if we hypothesize that the human Collective unconscious is a system and it can be thrown into non-linear Dynamics are far from equilibrium conditions perhaps nonlinear conditions can emerge and Brian helped me out here but you know when a system goes into Beyond far or far from equilibrium conditions things happen fast and things can jump and I really think that some Dynamic like that is underlies the potential that human beings have to make a Quantum step change it's not simply an aggregate of a lot of individuals but there is a kind of a deeper summation coming forward in all those individuals is that following on Brian again okay I'll let other people talk but I I'll remember what I was thinking s your job yeah sorry you thank you yeah I I was just saying Samy that it' be really cool if if you somersaulted and I I could tell you didn't understand me I felt so bad I thought he thinks I didn't like his sumers salty I loved it it was fantastic no no I could tell that you did good okay great great so I actually didn't want the microphone yeah but but Robert does and so here we are Jesse's all the way back and didn't go first I just who Aaron Lydia Lydia thanks um I have a question about working with fields yeah um I have two questions but they might have this a Sim very similar answer okay um one is that I could see how working with Fields goes can be almost applicable in kind of any relational situation yes um so I'm I'm inquiring if you could share something specific about a practice um in working with fields and I guess my second question is about a lot of us do work in relationship to being aware of the crisis that's happening in the world and um the level of Destruction and Chaos that a lot of people are experiencing and um I guess whether it's a a person we're trying to sort through something with or or being present with and wanting to be strong and and good and and used um in the face of also knowing that we're going to live our lives being very aware and maybe really close to levels of um destruction that are scary and um and and processing and being with lots of fear and and anger and delusion so do you have um yeah specific practice that you'd like to share or does that would make you think of that we something for us to maybe digest on compassion practices that's what comes to mind first of all you're already doing what you're describing you're already doing it you each one of you has made a choice to radically insert yourself into an evolutionary process to bring about a fundamental shift and an improvement in the condition of the planet you you've really you've traveled across the country you've aligned yourself with a very very distinctive institution and many of you are just like following pure gut instinct somewhere that you can't see because it's not a traditional track you're already doing it you're already plugged into to the Dynamics that are building pressure-wise you're already taking in massive quantities of information you're already watching a cooking taking place you're already reaching for becoming the embodiment of the solution so everything you're doing you're that you're talking about you're already doing so how can you do that better is what you're really asking just a little bit just a little bit better and and I think it's really important to take care of yourself because there's a lot of wear and tear and burnout cuz this is not over this is not going to be fixed soon this is you're going to die and still be in process your children will die and will still be in process so it's it's a long it's a marathon type of thing how do you keep yourself perpetually replenished in a long term like that how do you how do you kind of stay attuned to the opportunities and there's several things that come to mind but I guess the one that comes most deeply are compassion practices and every tradition has compassion practices where whether it's uh exchanging self for other or some type of practice where you just voluntarily expand your heart into Deep Beauty into deep pain into broad horizons and just hold that and and then bring it back down again and then take up your individual day work if every tradition has practices like that because compassion is the is the recognition of the inherent Oneness of life and so if we're talking about a revitalized contact between the individual the the highly refined highly evolved historically beautiful individuality but reconnecting into the larger context of the larger field of Life uh compassion is that expression of that celebration of that Oneness it's it's encouraging that Oneness there is Clarity practices if you need Clarity they're Clarity practices there are all sorts of different they're antidote practices but compassion practices seem to me to really most deeply address what you're what you're talking about thanks mhm s good very helpful thank you so much for this Chris yeah thank you um so my question is about coming down off the mountain uh I was really struck by that part and I'm curious if you could speak a little bit more towards it both your decision I mean you had your own own natural waves and evolution in terms of your use with sacred medicine yeah and then also um something I personally wrested with was an over attachment to marijuana and I also felt like it was really for many years in a very beautiful way keeping me connected to the mountain MH to the numinous to the archetypal realm M and I had to find and am still finding my own relationship to it in order to live my truth in this world in the way that I want to and how I want to bring do my work mhm and it's very alive and for me and also for a lot of my friends in different communities yeah so I'm just curious if you could you know speak a little more to that and also something around the intimacy with the Divine and how you feel you said that the veil or something shifted slowed down or calmed down yeah and I'm wondering where you are with that now yeah and why it's felt important for you to move in that direction at this point thank you the very heartfelt question that you're asking I'll do my best to speak to the same depth from which it comes I'm Neptune first house Square sun in the 10th house addiction is the shadow of of Neptune right and Neptune is what allows me to open up into deep Fields with kind of Rel relatively ease but the the Shadow and it and it's what gives me kind of a sensitivity to Collective Dynamics but the downside is it you know there the shadow side of it is taking the the lower form of of unity rather than the higher form of unity and that's been an issue for me addiction that not alcohol this but marijuana has been an issue for me that I really had to learn and grow it and and know when to Let It Go I stopped the high dose work for two reasons one because uh I was running into a lot of physical and subtle Energy System complications and I kept thinking that these complications would stop if I kind of went through another enough dying experiences and then eventually I realized no they were actually happening because I had gone through so many dying experiences and they were only going to get worse if I kept on plunging myself into these huge fires and I I I just I had to let the system and I was doing a lot of purification practice I was doing a lot of yoga I was doing a lot of Tibetan deity practices so I was really getting a lot of support but I was still running so much energy that I just my body was telling me you just got to let that energy calm down you've got to let it soothe out but the main on top of that there was another reason and and so there's a cautionary note I'm saying you know you all know I speak deeply and positively about psychedelics but it's a tricky path and even when you do it really well and I tried to do it really carefully and really well it's still tricky and the main reason I stopped is because I literally I just could not take coming back anymore the the intimacy with the divine the places that I eventually learned how to move into were so beautiful and so extraordinary and so home and so light that coming back was so painful now there are beings who can live in those places I know they are I read them you know all honor to the Great mahasa I'm not one of those beings who can sustain that yet and going in and out of that condition and we're not talking about Enlightenment this is something different this is kind of more like the mahasa something that in that lineage coming back out of it was just becoming too painful and eventually I asked the universe never to bring me back into to this reality until I wouldn't have to leave I couldn't take it anymore I learned that it's possible to have too much God and that's not I didn't even you know but it is you can just take on more than is healthy to if you're going to stay with your feet on the earth you can open yourself too deeply for it when I sto that deep work I went into a sadness that was just excruciating because I knew when I left I was never in my lifetime I would never be able to go back into that territory again because it takes it's like Olympic Training you can't get I can't get back to it by dropping a huge amount of acid today I would take years of work to be able to get back into this territory it's a momentum thing I knew I was leaving this forever until I died and I believe when I die I'm there I you know the universe would not be so cruel to not allow me to go back and if I can get to there it's an even deal coming back down marijuana allowed me to not to S to not because of all this work when I would smoke I would open up pretty big none of the intermediate kind of stuff it was just like open up to the sun and it it was a way of not getting really back down with my feet completely on the ground it it was just and it was a a deepening of my commitment to the mother to give up this particular because marijuana is a tricky thing it's a mild psychedelic but it's also a euphoric right and so it gets that little positive glow you know and and if you're if you're receptive to it and comfortable with it it's but it was keeping me literally off the ground it was keeping me just a little off and uh I began to realize that I couldn't finish my life's work in that condition that was just not good enough I had to get all the way down into the ground I had to get all the way down in my body so I I continue to do practice I you know I do vajana practice I do Zin practice I I do my thing and I re I take teachings and I I sit with the beings who you know can give the teachings but the diamond Luminosity domain is it's not the same as the the state of transparency the state of shunyata it's a it's a different reality there are beings who can live there I know there are I'm just not one of them yet okay thank you thanks Chris um I have two questions one um I'd love to hear more about the human that we're moving towards as a species or as you know um and the diamond soul and um and also I'm I'm just curious about you mentioned uh the moment that you reach when your students are no longer your students and that doesn't seem to happen here yeah uh and so I'm curious uh what how we might relate to that in a place where we are always invited back in um as continuing uh the learning fields and I don't know whether we're not closing the fields or whether we're closing them in certain ways but leaving Parts open or what how that's working but yeah okay that's an interesting question I think your own your your I'm okay your full-time faculty probably have a better answer to that than I'm going to suggest but I don't what I'm seeing is not a failure to close the field that doesn't mean maybe we could close the fields better but you know from what I see from a distance and what I've seen from Christina who was the program coordinator for a while and she used to write these poems for graduation graduation is a tremendous celebration of accomplishment and you seem to graduate well you seem to celebrate accomplishments well you celebrate your dissertations well and you celebrate your Master's thesis well uh it seems to me that you you do have closure built into your community you honor your graduates and bringing graduates back in doesn't mean that the fields haven't been well closed now if there's any fine-tuning to do well that's you know but I don't think just having an extended Community because again you're you're an unusual community mean really you see much more than most people see no wonder you'd get lonely out there you know there's not too many people who see what you see and there not too many people who are willing to put on their lives on the line the way you have put your lives on the line so naturally what would be more natural than to have a community that nourishes itself through your various levels of re-entering the world kind of you know and engaging it's yeah I think that's extremely good answer Chris and thanks for the question great question um the way the way I tend to think about us us PCC faculty and students and alumni um it's not so much in terms of field so it's helpful it's a good concept um I think of it much more in terms of individual and somewhat temporary karmic Jo joining of Will and mind and affect and for some people that joining has great longevity and for some people it doesn't and that seems to me um perfectly fine that some people really come into to this community with heart and mind and will in a way that is transformative of for those persons and for the community and other people are in more lightly and thereafter are held in a way that's proportionate to that commitment and so some of our alums in a certain sense haven't left the community no matter where they are and others I think I want to say will hardly here there is that huge range that seems to me right it's perfectly fine for each person to be as in in many different ways as he or she wishes for that time in their life given their karmic task and opportunity and so I don't think of a single field I think uh it's a um it's a community of many levels and some of us are trying to operate on all the levels and some of us are doing a just have other commitments and um it will be influential in some respect and not others and not all and for some people no it's really major comprehensively transformative and I think we sort of know who we are the way we talk to each other and um so when when Chris comes in with his um very profound and fascinating and to my mind very mysterious as well as inspiring uh biography um it seems to me that he touches very deep places in our community psyche but I don't for a moment think expect that Chris touches all of the members of our community many of whom are working on a different problem and have different different tasks different opportunities or are just blocked from something that Chris could give um or they already have moved on to something else so I'm very impressed by the when I think of all the reasons I'm impressed by PCC and uh um I'm very impressed by our the capacity of the entire community s to sustain and encourage very impressive plurality variety of ways of participation and so I for me field is a little too singular yes it is for who we are as we just look around we're really different from each other and it's great that we can come together as deeply and as creatively as we do given how different we are and will continue to be this is not a psychological philosophical boot camp this is a place where you come through and go out and something very deep or not so deep will have happened and I hope you have gratitude and ways of continuing to participate but the field I'm not even going to use the word the the community MH is constantly evolving thanks to the many entirely different highly Unique Individuals who come and and Stir It Up and lift it up uh to new possibilities the way I think about it MH so uh at some point we probably should and we got 12 minutes huh okay I'm not in charge I was only asking how about if I ask you answer your second question because I suspect it and maybe that maybe that's a good place to stop you know I mean the hot tubs are waiting for you not for us unfortunately I have a really low level totally mundane announcement this has gone from moment I think about Plato who wrote The Fabulous Symposium and the Republic and then he had write the laws yeah which was three times as long as the Republic uh and so what I'm about to say has to do with law has to do and I'm glad we live in a country of law but it's also sometimes uh it doesn't have to be um sometimes sort of a low a low a minimal level um so you heard the other night that Rick said we're because we're in a we're not only here in this culture but we're part of a larger legal culture institutional C Etc we have to observe uh expectations uh that our institutions and our whole legal system uh requires us to observe and so uh there are uh three groups here there's faculty including to adjunct faculty uh there are students and alums we could make three different suggestions but I I'd like to suggest that we make two faculty time and student time try to remember this faculty time in the lower tubs is only 8:15 to 9:15 in the morning and students therefore and students and L are not invited in the tubs at that time on the upper tub which some of you perhaps don't even know about is actually a square handicap tub it's not quite as beautiful but it's sometimes uh very very quiet um not always uh that tub there two times when you can't go one is the same as the others 8:15 to 9:15 in the morning and also 10 to 11: at night in other words right now uh by the time you get there you shouldn't go to the Upp and top you should go to one of the three is already there right uh probably did you say Sean yeah yeah I hope I hope Robert doesn't change this rule anyway is it clear and can you remember it okay than clear and remembered thank you very much because you don't want to keep talking about it and we and I'm really glad you have 23 hours all right in the low com enjoyable enjoy your one hour huh enjoy your one hour we only one hour the that's true but Rick half his life here have we've all been here 25 years 30 years don't worry you're here it's a special thing for you it's we want you to have as much as possible we also want to thank Chris first to his wonderful well his wonderful work his inspiring deep profound transformative work his wonderful writings and for this extra conversation which I thought was even more disclosing so we do thank you and applaud you you you are wonderful you're really I can't tell you how wonderful it is when I get to come here and spend time with you and to mix it up with you and to listen to what you have to say and what you do really you're just an extraordinary group group of people my heart is really deeply touched can you speak briefly to that about the question okay this has been something it's it's been a a a reoccurring and deepening theme of my psychedelic work it was went on for many many years and uh a a big hunk of it was I put it down in the chapter in the in dark night early Dawn on the Great Awakening chapter but it kept on going after that and the in the last three sessions of the SE I didn't know it was ending but it was about to end uh the universe gave me three last installments three last pieces and one of them was uh the the Capstone of a series of installments Around The evolutionary project and the future human and it'll be in you know this book and maybe I'll make this particular session available to the the PCC group and I'll I'll give it to Rick or or Robert and let it go out it was the most absolutely profoundly disorienting death dismember not just just reality ripped apart I mean really 70 sessions in you wouldn't think that you could go through something like this I mean you would think it would be used up you know but it was just an absolute ripped down total shattering of reality in order to give me one last piece in order to finish this installment on what's coming forward and this is something that's taking place at the at the Deep level of the collective psyche this this is you know we all live our lives and we die and reborn we die and reborn and we do it within a certain cradle and that cradle is the archetype of the human species that we are at this point in history and and what's happening is that cradle is about to shift the fundamental underlying structure of the human psyche is about to shift and so the entire Baseline of what we're dying and being reborn into is about to change when we make this transition and we will all be there in some way shape or form we will we will feel it we'll be part of it it it's going to be multiple Generations but we will all be part of it and when it happens and as it happens and as this Exquisite creature comes out of our historical womb and walks the Earth we will look back on all the pain from Homo erectus all the terrible suffering all the things we've done to each other all the horrendous things we've done to each other all the loneliness and all the Terrible Things We will look back on it and say it was worth it it was worth it because this being is the most Exquisite beautiful being picture a Humanity with its heart completely healed of all the wars and of all the rapes and of all the just completely whole again in a new way picture the mind just radiantly strong not fragmented not torn apart and no conflict within the the psyche no push pull just completely transparent on the earth of the earth green to its roots and yet at the same time in Easy communion with the surrounding intelligence of the universe heaven on Earth for such a species as this it was one of the greatest blessings of all the work just to be able to see what history is making what is in the process of emerging and uh and the sessions told me you have to start writing more about the future human because when it it gets dark and we're going into the darkness if you don't have a vision of what's coming if you don't understand what's being birthed by the pain it's you're going to get lost in the pain the humans will get lost and that'll but if you have a vision a a g and you all know you all have the intuition you were you had it before you were born you took it into this Incarnation you feel it and it's important to hold on to that it's important to really really deeply in your bones know that everything that you're investing in you are working with the universe to bring this forward and it will come forward it's taking us right up to the edge of Extinction really the old has to die in order to give birth to This Magnificent creature this is this is a a you know a species of Buddhas a species of christs a species of prophets this is when the feminine is completely healed and reconciled with the masculine giving complete unprecedented access to the blessings of cosmic intelligence and it is absolutely embodied no up and out cosmologies no Escapist theologies anymore and no BTO the BTO is in the process of emptying itself in this process the BTO is a fragment of is a condition of a temporary condition in the evolution Saga we are in the process by becoming more integrated we are in the process of emptying the BAU this species will not need that type of buffer right this is what we're working this is one person's poor grasp at what we are working for but I think we all feel it we know it and me this is not this is just a piece of one person seeing something what it is is much bigger than any one person can see yeah thank you thank you \[Applause\]

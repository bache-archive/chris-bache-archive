at the end of chris's talk uh during the this break chris will be um signing his new book and um i don't know if he was going to tell you this or not so i'll tell you the uh the book is called lsd and the mind of the universe and it's based uh on his experiential work with lsd and he got the publisher they were going to publish it put it out in december and he got them to agree to put out an advanced printing for this conference so this weekend is the debut of the book yeah right and um i don't know there's going to be enough copies for all the people that will really want this book because i've i've read the book um uh i i offered because i'm so enamored of chris's work to write an endorsement for it and so he stuck me in there with some of the other big shots that gave him endorsements um and so i've read the electronic version of this book and it's a mind blower i'm not kidding it is a mind blower so give a warm welcome to chris bash please \[Applause\] give me just a second folks to hook up my technology fingers crossed okay can you give me powerpoint on all three okay all right is my is this mic working no is it working now okay \[Laughter\] mercury retrograde right all right okay okay oh yeah great okay okay thank you all right how the technology moves forward it's wonderful to be here with you again after last year this is such a wonderful community when i was here last year i spoke to you about a book that i was just finishing that i was calling diamonds from heaven and it describes a 20-year journey of using uh high doses of lsd 73 sessions over 20 years to explore the structure of the universe that book is now here do we have it okay let's see do we have it here oh come on work for me okay let's see one here we go there it is publisher change the title but in my heart it will always be diamonds from heaven \[Applause\] i want to say upfront that i'm not sure that what i did was wise honestly i mean that i pushed myself extremely hard on this journey harder than was probably good for me but i've come through it intact reasonably so and i'm really looking forward to sharing with you where this journey took me and to share it with the world and it's not because i think my experiences are in any way unique or special but they are a particularly i think well-focused exploration of the structure of the universe and i want to say clearly that i did this work not as a therapist and not really seeking therapy so all honor and and deep respect to all the psychedelic therapists in the room this is a different agenda what i was primarily seeing i was trained as a philosopher of religion and what i was primarily seeking was an understanding of our universe as deeply as i could get by sinking deep into my own consciousness and in those deep states of consciousness exploring the structure the deep structure of the universe itself now i want to ground this story in the context of our collective psychedelic experience let's see is my mic on yet do we this no this one no okay sooner or later it'll come on i like to walk but okay \[Music\] is it on now it's on okay good pump the volume a little bit okay how many we have so many people working in so many different psychedelic mediums in this room right so many different substances so many different forms and so many different agendas all honor to the psychedelic community and all the work that we are doing collectively what i'm bringing to you today is the story of one particular journey into the universe one particular method one particular format all right which does not negate in any way any of the other dimensions of the dimensions that we're exploring it is simply one voice in our collective expression so let's go into it let's see i got two clickers here which one is going to work huh okay looks like it's this is a winner okay this is my psychedelic lineage my psychedelic lineage basically grounds in stan groff's work when i was 29 years old fresh out of graduate school just beginning my academic career in ohio i met stan's work his work realms of the human unconscious and then his book lsd psychotherapy which is this fundamental manual for working psychedelic sessions changed my life turned my life around pointed me a completely different direction and it has become my entire life's work now in in terms of the sessions themselves of structuring sessions i want to emphasize i've never tripped i've never gone to a concert on lsd i've never spent the night all night tripping with my friends and talking about things it's not that those are bad things those can be fine but in my work every time i took lsd i was working in a very very carefully controlled environment i was isolated i was in my home i was are in my wife's office i was totally perfected protected from the world i did always solo work i didn't work in groups there are advantages for working in groups or advantages for doing solo work just owning mine was always solo work which allowed me to go to follow exactly where the experiences were taking me and to push myself in that direction wherever it would take me in stan's work are we not getting ah okay come on okay clearly two different therapeutic modality that stan outlines psycholytic low-dose therapy psychedelic high-dose therapy psycholytic low-dose maybe about 200 micrograms where the psyche peels itself layer by layer we move into it layer by layer sessions up to about 100 sessions psychedelic therapy very very different therapy uh very concentrated very intense experiences the goal is not to work through all the layers of the personal unconscious but to sort of blow through the psychodynamic level of consciousness and to trigger an experience of transcendence and experience basically they were trying to trigger near-death episode experiences working with people who were terminally ill they were going to die and they were working with the anxiety that they were facing as they were going towards the death this form of therapy was limited to three sessions in spring grove hospital no more than three sessions so i came along and i thought well okay if it can be done safely three times it can be done safely more than three times and it can be done safely more than three times but i found that it was a much much more demanding protocol than i had anticipated in the beginning and it took all of my research my resources to basically manage what unfolded in this journey this is not a therapeutic journey it's a journey of cosmological exploration and therefore it requires something of an explorous constitution and it also requires something of an explorers preparation an explorer's position in life where you have the opportunity where you can push this deeply this far beyond the edges beyond the maps where most people have gone when i got to the end of this journey and was writing up my accounts and was looking back over the whole thing i realized well i thought i was just doing an extended course of psychedelic therapy high dose therapy but what i realized was that this process that i had gotten engaged in went so deep and went so far and generated complications that were so intense i had to give it a different name so i call it do i have it right psychedelic exploration the method is the method of psychedelic therapy total isolation always working with a sitter carefully selected music you know the whole works there the difference is the number of sessions involved for me 73 sessions i did three sessions at the psychodynamic level i did three sessions about 200 micrograms and then after that all of my sessions were at 500 600 micrograms again this is not a protocol that i recommend i wouldn't do it that way again i would do it differently i would balance the plant medicines more with the synthetic psychedelic medicines i would really only push myself periodically with high doses rather than pushing myself so relentlessly in that way i have worked with psilocybin i have worked with ayahuasca and salvia divinorum a number of plant medicines i did most of that work after i stopped my lsd work but lsd in the mind of the universe is really focused specifically on what happened on this high-dose journey i want to emphasize that the circumstances in which i did this work were kind of unusual in that they were very very stable and concentrated and focused in all of my work i had the same sitter for all these years the same sentence setting same intention same location all in northeast ohio same substance same dose level and the same recording process always recording every every session as completely as possible within 24 hours of the session okay what this did i've come to appreciate when you stabilize your work in this way when you eliminate as many variables as possible and using the same methodology in the same consistency it stabilizes the conversation that opens up between you and the creative intelligence of the universe it stabilizes the communion so that one session leads to another session leads to another session in a very coherent intelligent manner even though you may not understand all the details of the continuity when it's unfolding when you're looking out over a longer period of your work you can begin to understand the patterns of continuity that you are in dialogue with in a sense a single intelligence in this process i i say that it carefully because there's so many layers to this intelligence there's so many forms of this intelligence but in the end when you see the the continuity across sessions it you're si can't help but feel like you're engaging a single creative intelligence now i kept detailed records of my work i have about 400 pages of session notes again recording the session always within 24 hours because you know what it's like two or three days later things are not as clear as when you did it right the day after i kept track of all the dates of the sessions i even plotted the astrological variables late in the work i used astrology to choose the dates of my sessions i was working on average about five sessions a year now i worked for four years i stopped for six years for reasons that are not important to go into now they're in the book and then i picked up for another 10 years of very intense work i worked about five sessions a year and so i looked when i became aware of rick tarniss and stan groff's hypothesis of the relationship between the outer planets and and transit astrology global transits and my psychedelic sessions i wanted to study this so i looked at that attracted those variables and there's an appendix on that issue in the back of uh the living class of llc in the mind of the universe i keep wanting to say diamonds from heaven i have to retrain myself now the story i'm telling in lsd in the mind of the universe is not primarily a personal story there was a personal story there was personal healing there were personal insights but what i found was that when i was doing this work the personal components generally tend to manifest in the beginning of a session and at the end of the session when i was leaving space-time and when i was coming back into space-time that's not entirely correct because sometimes a whole session was spent in personal healing but in general after about the first 15 sessions when i was at the peak of the sessions as indicated in these large circles in this series of sine waves which represent a series of sessions when i was at that those peak hours i was operating far beyond personal reality okay that's the story i'm trying to tell in lsd in the mind of the universe i've dropped out a lot of the personal story because from a philosophical perspective that that from a therapeutic perspective that's relevant but from a philosophical perspective it's the large story which is the more important story a lot of work at the medical level at the therapeutic level really focuses on ego dissolution transcending the limitations of your physical body entering into a deeper communion into mystical experiences what i found was when you'd when i did this work it wasn't just one cycle of death rebirth now in this image the uh the drop at the bottom of the circle represents egoic awareness our time space awareness the line rep everything below the line is physical reality everything above the line is transpersonal reality or spiritual reality a lot of work a lot of discussion focuses on that first circle the death rebirth of ego and that's an important place to focus it is the fundamental transition what i found in my work was you actually go through multiple levels of death and rebirth and it's not ego dying over and over again you're going through death and rebirth processes which take place at different levels of the universe at different levels of of the creative intelligence of the universe and the deaths and rebirths at the higher levels are different than the death and rebirth at the beginning level when you're shedding time and space when you're shedding your identity built up in time and space they're harder to describe because you know the levels of consciousness that you're born into in the beginning you're born out of at the end when you're being born into the species mind it has a certain set of qualities and characteristics but when you are shedding the species mine when you are going beyond the collective psyche when you are entering into archetypal reality that is a different pattern of death and rebirth now i follow i use stan groff's category stan talks about psychic level transpersonal experience high and low psychic high and low subtle level high and low causal level that's a kind of convenient category but of course how can we possibly describe the full spectrum of the divine experience of spiritual experience with simply three or six categories these are simply rough approximations which are useful in order to describe certain transitions that took place on this journey when i got to the end of the journey and i was kind of working and crunching all the experiences and putting them all together for the book i realized that i began to count up how many fundamental deep death oops oops hi sorry i'm jumping ahead of myself these cycles of death and rebirth are kind of really like tauruses you kind of break through you open up you expand into a new level and then there's a sense of gathering in everything that took place blowing through into another level and then you explore that level you become competent and stabilize states of consciousness at that level there's a kind of a gathering in and then that if you follow the process through takes you into yet another death and rebirth process into a deeper level and one of the ways i kind of image this is in terms of a nuclear explosion now this image triggers very very deep responses in us and it should this is this is an image of humanity's insanity at one level but i don't wanna i wanna don't wanna go there i wanna use it simply to make one point when you go through deep deep death and rebirth processes where you are shattering every level that you have known and in not only in earth but everything that you have known in some sessions it drops you deeper into the universe and it allows levels of reality to come into your awareness which were not in your awareness before they were always there but you were not experiencing them and there is something like that that happens with a nuclear explosion when this explosion drives deeper into the atmosphere it brings out levels of the atmosphere which previously you could not see and something like that happens with the lsd work or any kind of deep psychotherapy deep psychedelic work it brings you into levels that previously you were not aware of now the dualism here is i want to dissolve the dualism now because the nuclear explosion the center and the levels of reality one is entering or in this image are two different things now dissolve that duality because when one dies at that level you literally dissolve into that field of reality you dissolve into that strata that stratum of reality but we're not talking about bombs here we're talking about the universe exploring the nature of the cosmos itself when i got to the end of my work and i was kind of counting up out of all the deaths and all the purifications and all the purgations how many core fundamental levels of reality did i go through i counted five here they are first the death of self transcending our time space identity our egoic reality after that something that took place at the collective mind transcending the individual mind something is taking place at the level of species consciousness after that something that took place at the archetypal level at the archetypal dimension of mind and then something that took place in what i call causal oneness now oneness of course comes up many many levels oneness can come up in the first ego death oneness is a fundamental truth and it occurs in many different forms there's something distinctive and unique about causal oneness or oneness at causal level reality because here you're dealing with there is no outside to reality when you're in causal oneness you are not experiencing oneness you are in the condition in which the universe experiences itself as being fundamentally unified with no core divisions whatsoever at any level physical spiritual reincarnational it's a fundamental core oneness of reality and then at the last level what i call diamond luminosity what buddhism calls dharmakaya the pure light of absolute reality so let me use these five categories and then show you how these lay out in the chapters of lsd in the mind of the universe and then i'm just going to share some observations on each of these categories as we go through just to kind of give a quick overview death of self there's a chapter crossing the boundary of birth and death i'm going to go back into these in more detail in a minute but just to give you where it is in the book now there is a chapter one which is the chapter on methodology it's a rather long chapter in the book because i really wanted to be very very clear on the methodology that i used and some of the ways of working with psychedelics at this level and there's a chapter after this called a session day because someone had asked me why don't you just kind of take us into a typical day and show us what happens and so i did i kind of wrote a narrative of a typical session day but in terms of the levels of consciousness those three levels of consciousness really kind of function at the death of self my wife is taking care of me by the way i didn't mention i forgot astrology working with astrology and psychedelic sessions really really interesting insights emerge my wife christina is a professional astrologer and she kind of helps me understand some of the archetypal dynamics that are operating in some of the session material okay collective mind there are three chapters that have to do with the collective mind the ocean of suffering sort of the challenging purifying part of working with the species mind deep time in the soul an initiation into the universe i'm going to come back to these in a minute archetypal mind there is a chapter the greater reel of archetypal reality calls a oneness the chapter of benediction of blessings then we move to diamond luminosity a chapter diamond luminosity but before i discuss diamond luminosity i have a chapter called the birth of the future human which actually describes a series of visionary experiences that started at the initiation of the universe and continued all the way into the final chapter into from session 22 to session 70 is one of the most consistent recurring themes what's happening to humanity where are we going what is our historical time in history what's happening at the deep structural level and then diamond luminosity and then the last chapter final vision where i was given the last what i call the last of the great visions of the journey and then the goodbye sessions the wrap-up sessions so let me go back and just offer a few observations on each of these levels first let me check my time okay that's not bad we're okay first crossing the boundary of death and birth how many people here know the work of stanislav groff okay then you know exactly what i'm going to be talking about here because this is the perinatal level of consciousness this is that level that is the boundary level between space-time consciousness and first transpersonal reality when i got into this level i felt like a poster child for stan's perinatal uh level of consciousness intense intense physical purifications um fetal sensations reliving aspects of birth tremendous psychological uh existential angst uh the questioning the fundamental meaningfulness of life confronting the meaninglessness of life and then eventually uh ego death a complete shattering of egoic reality the ego is a tough son of a \[ __ \] but in the final analysis it's not that hard to take apart it's harder to heal than it is to shatter it's kind of curious but on these last two sessions this is two and a half years work in ten sessions at the end of these sessions the last two sessions it just took me and snapped me like a twig i started the day as a white male highly educated academic obsessed with the meaning of life it totally inverted all of those variables it turned me into women turned me into women of color turmey and the women at the laundromat with no prospects turned me into women who had no interest whatsoever in philosophy or the meaning of anything of life at all of course it wasn't women that were the problem of course and it wasn't a lack of education that was a problem it was what it was the social identity that i had internalized and accepted as what i am that was the problem and the universe forced me to become the opposite of what i was and just snapped me and when eventually i let go and surrendered to that experience i entered the world of women under the arm of the great mother and i was taken through the experience of hundreds and hundreds of women's lives it was just an extraordinary transformation in my own experience i wish every man could have the experience and i'm sure many of the men in this room have had that kind of experience of experiencing so deeply the the inner essence and the inner experience of the so-called opposite sex now i believe in reincarnation i've written a book on reincarnation i think we've all lived lives as men and women but what was happening here was i was not being invited to reclaim my former lives as women this was different this was saying where you are going gender does not exist let go and so i let go and i entered into spiritual reality what happened next much to my surprise is that things didn't get easier things got harder after going through a transition experience in which my compassion was expanded and open to the suffering of the world i entered a domain of collective suffering and anguish and and pain which deepened session by session systematically and it deepened for two years it took two years and 14 sessions to go through all of this work there was a year of the ocean of suffering before i stopped my sessions for the six years i stopped for six years and then i started again six years later under completely different a different time in life different set of expectations and different astrological transits but at the other side of that six year gap the ocean of suffering started exactly where it had stopped six years before which i think is a measure of the intelligence and the intentionality of the consciousness of directing our work when the ocean of suffering opened at first i thought that this represented a deepening of my ego death i thought i was being you know kind of cleaned up more and this is kind of implicit in stan's theory he sees he recognizes and he's he's witnessed these collective ordeals but stan sees these collective ordeals or at least he did he saw these collective ordeals as being drawn in through resonance to ego death all right so it's ego death which is really the primary driver and when you get into ego death in the context of the collective psyche you can tap into some of the suffering of humanity that's still stored in the collective psyche and it seeps into your experiences through through resonance that's what i so i went with that interpretation at first but what i found was that this went on for so long it was so extreme and it lasted for so many years and it involved so many millions and millions of beings that i decided that this could not be correct eventually i came to the conclusion that these sessions were not trying to sort of purify me or heal me or transform me these experiences were aimed at nothing less than the transformation of the collective psyche of our planet it was about healing the entire planet in some way shape or form somewhere in working with very very intense states of consciousness something happens that there is a flip and what had started out in my mind as personal transformation was taken over by the work of collective transformation now i don't think anything anyone did this to me nobody it was no trick that was done to me i accept responsibility for this this is simply part of my karmic contract in this lifetime and i think it's part of the government contract of a lot of people in this room right the work you take on in your deep deep work is often disproportionate to anything that makes sense in terms of your personal life story even your personal former life life story many of us get into work so so deep that you have to open up to a deeper understanding of what's actually taking place in these sessions especially at this time in history if we were doing this work maybe 500 years ago maybe not so but this time at this time in history the work of the hour is collective transformation our species is going into a near extinction event we do not have time to \[ __ \] around we are getting this is serious work here and if you are open if you are open and willing to let this work come through and i'm not saying everybody should be and i'm not saying that it's necessarily a healthy thing in many circumstances it can be overwhelming and it can be intimidating and you do not want to go there but if you're open if you're capable and if it is part of your karmic contract the work we do in these deep sessions i think there are more bodhisattvas on this planet than we might think initially the work we do is for our collective transformation now in my experience working at high doses every session kind of breaks down into two phases there's a purification phase and an ecstatic phase there's kind of the the dark hard death dying kind of phase and then there's the static phase if you in reference to this work and james excellent talk this morning about shadow work and engaging the shadow in working as i did in a non-therapeutic modality one of the great gifts i learned from stan groff is to completely absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far wherever as wants to take you now remember these are not tripping there's no confusion in the outer world there's nothing going on in the outer world that's getting into my inner space i know that anything i am confronting is coming entirely from within or through within if you submit my experiences if you submit completely to whatever is taking place in that context it will take you deeper and deeper it'll take you into sometimes unspeakable anguish and completely inexplicable anguish into chaos into into just terrible suffering confusion but if you let it do that eventually that will come to a crescendo it'll peak and then it'll take you through to something that lies on the other side you enter into the ecstatic phase of the session into the teachings phase of the session into the cosmological phase of the session even if the next session you may come back around and enter back into the suffering again but if you go through this process into the surrender death and rebirth process and let it take you there is a deeper deep underlying dynamic that's maybe not be clear to you at the time that unfolds itself over time often you cannot understand what's happening to you in the pain part of a session you cannot understand the logic of the pain until you have moved on to the next stage because often these transformations it's not until you're looking from a higher state of consciousness that you can understand what you were engaging at this lower state of consciousness you understand it's really important to follow this all the way through because if you follow the pain all the way through what happens is you go from suffering to resolution to peace and what you internalize therefore is the entire cycle and this is what prevents the suffering from being lodged in your system it's unintegrated trauma or some kind of something you have to deal with i have gone through terrible terrible suffering i don't have any negative ramifications or after effects of that suffering because you internalize the suffering resolution peace suffering resolution you learn to trust to trust the cycle and to trust that there is an intelligence that's behind this dynamic process when i came out of the ocean of suffering in that first year's work i was spun into what i call deep time and i was given the experience for one year seven sessions over and over again consistently methodically laying out i experienced the total the whole of my life from beginning to end as a simultaneous now deep time i called it whole time first and then i called it deep time deep time is not eternity it's not timelessness that's something different deep time is moving into a state of awareness where you can experience different spans of time as simultaneously present i experienced all the time moments of my life as simultaneously present and i experienced it like a tree the the deepest themes of my life were the deep branches which had been rece the biggest branches which had received most of the energy the my most recent experiences were the leaves at the edges of the before i died where the leaves at the edges of my of the tree but all of them being simultaneously present when i first went into this state in the 11th session when i came out of it i couldn't remember it it was the most meaningful experience of my life hours before but when i came out of it i could barely reconstruct the edges of it it took me months to recover the pieces of the session but what i found was if you go back again and again and again at that edge to your living edge in your sessions what i found was you understand more you're able to remember more things that didn't make sense in the beginning begin to make sense the pieces begin to cohere fragments begin become uh integrated gestalts this is an important epistemological point when you break through into a new level of consciousness you often get fragmented you can't maintain coherence because you're in a totally different cognitive reality but if you go back with clear focus and intent and clear setting isolation clear setting you go back again and again your cog you learn to be aware in levels of consciousness that in the beginning just swallowed you you learn i learned how to stay conscious in deep time and this is something which happened again and again when i would break through to a deeper level of consciousness there was often a fragmented quality i couldn't remember i could only get details that hold on to details but over time those details began to coalesce they began to become complete patterns of understanding reincarnation was this whole inside of my life from beginning to end was all kind of saturated with insights of karma and uh the intentionality the deeper intentionality that binds us into the world of time and space i wrote life cycles not mentioning psychedelic work by my first book life cycles is about reincarnation in the web of life for me reincarnation is just a fundamental axiom if you don't understand reincarnation then you just don't understand what the hell is going on in this world you just have to to see the deeper patterns six year break had two more children wrote a book got promoted six years started again ocean of suffering starts exactly where it had stopped before but now in the ecstatic portion of the sessions totally different world it started me completely beyond personal reality i was given a series of seven initiations into the universe it was as if it was not as if it was the creative intelligence some creative intelligence took me and basically gave me a course in cosmology 101. it just took me through and gave me a series of experiences that she that deepened my understanding of what's going on in the universe now i name i give each of my sessions a name because i'm trying to hold all of my sessions in my mind all at the same time so i give them a name that reflects the pith of the session and i actually will break my sessions into bullet points as well so here are the names of the sessions that were that i deal with in the chapter the initiation into the universe the first uni creating was an exploration of the very uh the co-creation of the universe i just the the i i won't go into the details i it's so attempting can't go into details just the book the cosmic tour was just an extraordinary tour of the universe this intelligence that took me somewhere it would show me things show me how things were working sometimes i didn't understand it'd come back for me and everything would get bigger and i would understand and it would take me on it was just extraordinary journey council of elders was actually a session which was teaching me how to keep my cognition coherent with respect to levels of reality it's really important when you have a substance that allows you to break through multiple levels of reality you have to train yourself to keep your experience coherent with respect to levels of reality okay that was part of a training exercise dying into oneness was an experience of just repeatedly dying and deeper and deeper love death thou death by death deeper into oneness the master plan i'll come back to healing the collective wound was basically a kind of an orgy of pain and suffering and then i was spun deep into archetypal reality and the collective suffering the ocean of suffering never returned it never returned now it's not like the the world isn't suffering it's not that there isn't pain in the collective psyche but my work with the ocean of suffering was time limited and we went on to another level and what i learned later is that you don't abandon your species when you go deeper beyond the ocean of suffering or deeper beyond the pain of the species you actually become more useful to it by in the beginning you're sucking pain out of the collective psyche but later you're pouring grace and joy and insight into the collective psyche from higher levels of consciousness i have to speed up i'm getting the time signatures here the greater reel of archetypal reality when i entered archetypal reality my identity as a human being began to fall away from me i found out that we have an identity a deep deep visceral identity which is deeper than our individual egoic identity and to die as a human being is deeper than to die as an individual human being and if in order to go into archetypal reality i had to literally cease to function at a cognitive level that had anything to do with human cognition i had to be willing to give that up in order to learn how to acclimate into flows of reality that were radically profoundly beyond not only my individual existence but beyond human existence i moved outside the human field two levels of archetypal reality one high platonic level where i experienced something like what plato is pointing to except that plato describes archetypes as eternal forms in the mind of an unchanging god that's not how i experienced them i experienced them as vast living massive beings that were just so overwhelmingly i could not wrap my mind around them they're just totally beyond my capacity to comprehend i could touch them experience pieces but they just were far far too large at a lower level of archetypal reality at a lower subtle level entering deep into the collective unconscious of humanity deep into the species mind experiencing patterns that experiencing the human species as a single being and experience networks of intelligence weaving together our individual efforts our individual minds our individual karma into larger patterns which were how the species as a whole lived and breathed i think i was being given a crash course on how our species works as a single organism in order to prepare the way for what came next at archetypal reality here are the sessions that i address and notice how much cleansing is taking place at this level the 28th session was an extraordinarily positive session it was of my first contact with causal level reality tremendous ordeal but then spinning out into causal of reality incredibly beautiful clear gorgeous experience the next three sessions were just grueling ordeals of purification they went on for hours and hours and hours it lasted three sessions over six months what i came to understand eventually is that deeper states of consciousness are higher states of energy when you shift into a deeper state of consciousness you are entering a higher level of energy and you have to acclimate to that energy and that takes time and work you have to go through a series of purification processes cleansing processes and it's hard to describe because they're not personal purification processes you literally have to purify whatever you are at the time in order to stabilize consciousness at these deeper levels of reality and this repeats itself over and over again so much so that i came to dread the session after a breakthrough session when i have a breakthrough the next session was usually a turgid carrying out the garbage kind of quality right but you go through that you go clean it up clean it up until you can come back into that level of consciousness and maintain coherent cognition at that level of consciousness i began to have experiences of reincarnation as a collective process i began to experience the human species as a single organism that was growing itself evolving itself by incarnating all billions and billions of its precious beings simultaneously i began to understand certain patterns of reincarnation as an evolutionary driver not just as ind i had always thought of the reincarnation as an individual story the individual's person grows matures makes individual choices hopefully good choices but here i began to experience reincarnation as an evolutionary driver an evolutionary dynamic that operated at the collective level simultaneously with the personal level and at that point the wall between personal karma and collective karma came down completely and i realized that there is no such thing as private personal karma personal karma and collective karma are all deeply intertwined and i wrote dark knight early dawn in order to answer the question why did my suffering go as deep and as long as it did in my sessions and the answer is because at this deep level of consciousness the boundary between the individual and the collective becomes very very porous and if you are willing to you become an agent of collective transformation in this process hiring right along after a year and a half and uh eight session a year and a half and 11 sessions at the archetypal level i entered into a year of extraordinary blessings i entered into calls of oneness it was just non-stop joy there are four sessions that i address in the book describing this the forest the birth of the diamond soul singing the universe away in jesus blood first one is experience of oneness emptiness no self in me no self anywhere in the world singing the universe away was a an experience of entering into the primal void what stan calls the metacosmic void the the domain of the formless out of which the light emerges that actually gives birth to the physical universe jesus's blood was an experience of extraordinary cosmic love just being loved like i've never been loved before in this lifetime the birth of the diamond soul let me pause just for a second there because it's really important 11 years before i had experienced my life as a totality from start to finish now i began to experience an ex where i began to experience all my former lives coming together they were just coming in fast and furious and it was like wrapping a filament of white light around a kite spool and at a certain point when they hit critical mass and when they hit critical mass they fused and when they fused they exploded into a diamond light it was my first contact with what i came to call diamond light and it was an experience which was showing me where reincarnation is taking humanity not exactly where but how it works reincarnation is not simply making incremental improvements in our life lifetime by lifetime adding a layer adding a layer it's true we do but at a larger level sooner or later if we keep this process up we die we remember who we are we're born we forget we learn we die we remember we're born we we forget we learn if we keep this up lifetime after lifetime sooner or later the soul the larger consciousness that holds all of our lives wakes up inside time and space not just in the spiritual reality that we return to when we die but it wakes up inside time and space that i call the birth of the diamond soul just to put a language to it other people have spoken about this i think it is in a sense spiritual awakening in the deepest sense we it is that the emergence in history of a fully integrated being that has integrated hundreds of thousands of years experience and has now been jumped into a quantum a higher level of awareness and functional functionality with tremendous expansion of compassion for other human beings because we we've had so many lifetimes of experience with each other and a profound transparency to the universal creative intelligence it's just it is a turning point in the evolutionary story i'm being pushed on time and absolutely right to be so and this is the most important chapter of the book the birth of the future human when i started this work in 79 i didn't think much about the future of the human race i didn't really understand much about the ego crisis we were going into this 1979 and yet this became one of the most consistent recurring themes of my work a series of visionary experiences that kept showing me over and over and over again humanity is coming to a turning point humanity is coming to a profound revision of its foundation humanity is coming into a time of great awakening over and over again great awakening the turning point of history a before and after moment in time the visions of awakening is a collection of six visions that i pull out of different sessions i just group them together in order to tell the story in a coherent fashion but i had not been shown how the universe was possibly going to pull this off how are we going to make this transition and then a year and a half later i went into session 55 the great awakening session where i was taken deep into deep time but not personal deep time deep into collective deep time and i went into the future and i experienced the death and rebirth of our species i wasn't a human being when i experienced this i was the entire i had merged into the field of the collective psyche and i experienced this crisis in history as the species will experience it i experienced a crisis that brought us to our knees a deep and profound unraveling a shattering of life as we had known it a profound frightening time but out of this process was born an extraordinary being a transformed humanity a shift in the fundamental blueprint of the human psyche and this was being done not at the surface level but at the deep level of the collective unconscious this was a shift in the blueprint of our species i was also given a series of initiations into how this was actually going to be pulled off and it i don't have time to go into it maybe in the workshop retreat i'll be doing next week where we talk it has to do with understanding the dynamics of the collective psyche understanding non-linear systems understanding how systems uh affect our how systems functions when they're driven into non-linear states we have a good understanding of what happens to physical systems when they're driven into non-linear states well the human species is the human unconscious is a fundamental unified psychic field my sense is that the great suffering that we are entering is going to energize is going to be so widespread and so long lasting it will literally energize the collective psyche is never before in human history and when it is energized by such terrible suffering it will be capable of transforming itself in an historically unprecedented manner and it will give birth to the future human and i believe that the future human will be the diamond soul our future is already encoded in our past meaning that nature has been preparing us for this event has been preparing for us for hundreds of thousands of years we have been growing we have been collecting information collecting experiences going forward going deeper labor is a long i mean a birth excuse me gestation is a long process birth is a relatively fast process reincarnation has been gestating the future human for generations after generations after generation we are coming into the time of birth it's a hard time it's a scary time it's a near-death experience kind of time but it's a process i think which is giving birth to an extraordinary creature just an extraordinary creature all right my time is used up so i have to just pop this very quickly the diamond luminosity \[Applause\] \[Music\] will you give me five minutes of your break okay when i finished the greater reel of ark and when i finished the benediction of blessings i felt completely satisfied i felt like i had given something in the ocean of suffering work and i had been rewarded by more than i could possibly imagine i felt completely at peace i had known oneness i had been drenched in cosmic love what more could you ask for but there was still five years of work to go after going through yet one more very very intense death and rebirth process at a cosmological level i was spun into the domain of absolute transcendent clarity light light as i had never known light before absolutely absolutely clear just the buddhist are right just touching it once just touching it once can undo centuries of wandering around lost in samsara extraordinary purity dissolving into the crystalline body of the divine becoming light becoming light your mind completely dissolved into the light which is the primal light before existence before physical existence manifest the sessions there were out of 26 sessions over four years i entered this reality only four times four times in 26 sessions in between those four times more purification more purgation just tremendous cleansing cleansing cleansing and also interesting healing personal healing which really surprised me because i would have thought personal healing would have come sooner but here i was suddenly involved in personal healing after years of working at the collective level and it took me a while to understand why things were unfolding in this order not time to talk about there but there was a logic to it there was an intention to it i entered into the diamond luminosity two times i went into deeper and deeper into the diamond luminosity and then the last two diamond luminosity experiences were not about going deeper into the universe it was about the diamond luminosity crunching itself deeper and deeper into my physical body crunching itself into my psyche into my into my psychological awareness but literally going right into my physical body and changing the physiological structure of my cells that's what it felt like and the pivot came in the middle when i was in the 50th session extremely the deepest i ever went anywhere in the universe so i was in this blissed-out incredibly beautiful place and all of a sudden everything pivoted 90 degrees and i saw a reality that was extremely far in the distance i saw whole worlds in the far distance and a light hit me from that reality i call it the absolute light just to differentiate it's all at something it hit me and it absolutely shattered me and that's when i understood this is an endless journey i had thought i had picked up the idea i had believed that this journey you do it to get somewhere to get there as an end point to the journey you get home and it's either oneness with god or entering in the primal void but there's a point there's an end point at this session i let go of that idea and i realized it's an endless journey the infinite is much much larger than any of our spiritual traditions have ever been able to grapple with yet it is an infinite process and that's why i would be much gentler with myself if i were doing this work again i've learned that the process is not to try to get to the end of the end of the line the process is simply open up let as much of the creative intelligence of the universe into you as you possibly can let it transform you let it break your heart and open your heart and then be patient with the slower pace of our organic transformation all right the last the final vision gave me one last vision the final capstone of the entire 70 or 20-year journey it gave me it was the capstone of the birth of the future human it took me deep it was put me through a terrible strip down took me deeper into time than i had ever been taken before and it gave me an intimate experience of the future human it gave me several different lessons and it it gave me an experience of the universe as a diamond maker i experienced a swamp a very dark kind of mud which is represented the top soil of reincarnation where everything all individual life forms were dissolving reconstituting dissolving reincarnating dissolving reincarnating and then there there were these sparks of bright light shooting off into the universe these were diamond souls these are fully integrated souls moving into the universe centers of integration capable of integrating more and more levels of consciousness that the ego could alone could never integrate the universe is a diamond maker the universe is growing sparks of diamond luminosity and it makes no difference to it or makes it makes a difference but it makes no difference whether it takes a billion years or a million years for this process to come to fruition it is a very very patient process it has created the cauldron of creativity and it is taking us deep deep into places that we can only imagine the last session the last chapter is coming off the mountain which i won't talk about but i learned that coming off the mountain was as hard as going up the mountain walking away from such intimacy with the divine walking away from such profound immersion into the divine reality into it's hard once you have known the joy of dissolving into light time and space can begin to feel kind of dried up not very interesting it took me 10 years to really get back into time and space to be grounded to be and to be comfortable being who i am what i am for the remaining years of my life here i don't know whether i would have been able to make it back fully if it had not been for the love of my wife christina thank you for letting me share this joy this story with you it's a joy to bring it to this particular community uh we're going to be doing a workshop friday saturday which i hope will have more time to go into it and one of the things i want to experiment with is can we use guided visualization to open these places which are universal they lie in all of everybody's hearts and everybody's experience in addition to having a conversation about psychedelics and protocols and methodology and the different experiences that different people have gotten into in addition to that we're going to explore using guided imagery and deep relaxation to sort of activate some of these deep places inside that live inside each of our hearts thank you very much \[Applause\] \[Music\] you

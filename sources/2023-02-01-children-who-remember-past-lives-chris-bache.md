## Abstract

In this brief clip, Chris Bache summarizes key findings from psychiatrist Ian Stevenson’s research on children who recall previous lives. Bache highlights Stevenson’s two-volume work on reincarnation and biology, which documents 1,787 cases in which children reported verifiable memories of prior lifetimes and, notably, displayed birthmarks that corresponded to fatal wounds from those alleged past lives. For Bache, these data suggest a continuity of awareness that predates the present body and point to a mechanism by which intense traumatic impressions may cross the mind–body boundary between incarnations. The clip underscores the empirical, case-based nature of Stevenson’s approach and its implications for philosophy of mind, psychophysical interaction, and the study of consciousness beyond a single lifespan.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I think Stevenson’s evidence is strong evidence for some type of continuity of awareness from lifetime to lifetime. Especially his last two books, a two-volume work on reincarnation and biology, in which he studied 1,787 cases of children who not only had psychological recall from their previous lifetime but actually bore marks on their bodies—birthmarks—that replicated wounds of death in the previous incarnation. Somehow it was as if consciousness had been traumatized in such a way that it imprinted not only on the subsequent mind but on the subsequent body. After looking at this data a lot, I think it tells us we have information in our mind that predates this body.

In the third installment of their dialogue, Chris Bache and Richard Rudd move beyond evidence for

reincarnation into its evolutionary implications. They explore how personal revelation and collective

experience converge in a planetary “birth canal,” where intensified crises catalyze a species-level

transformation. Bache frames this transition through field dynamics and death–rebirth cycles in

non-ordinary states, suggesting a coming shift from egoic identity to soul awareness, with humanity

approaching a fusion point that alters the archetypal architecture of the collective unconscious. Rudd

speaks to cellular knowing, endurance through shadow work, and an emergent epoch where fear dissolves

as the veil of death thins. Both envision the “future human”: heart-healed, mind-open, sensorially

refined, living from bliss and stewardship of Gaia. They urge full presence, compassionate action, and

trust in an intelligence driving us through metamorphosis toward a new civilizational platform.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Well, here we are again for our third discussion. We tentatively called this one “limitless

time” because we want to bridge into the deeper questions around reincarnation. Where is this constant

learning and recycling taking humanity? Where is it going? What might the deep future look like? And,

most importantly, how might that understanding shift how we engage our life right now? Where should we

begin? I think we should acknowledge that each of us brings a deep experiential basis. We’re not simply

speculating. We carry convictions born of unusual experiences. Why don’t you speak first?

**RICHARD RUDD:** It’s true—that’s what brought us together for these dialogues. I was just explaining the

difference between knowledge and wisdom. Wisdom comes by revelation, by listening, by receiving; knowledge

is chased and hunted. Revelation gives cellular knowing. My path has been guided by a cellular sense of

what’s coming for humanity. It’s not always easy to hold, because not everyone feels it. Yet it leaves me

more relaxed at a fundamental level; I simply know everything is going to be fine. I can’t explain why I

was given that knowing, though many listening will recognize it from their own breakthroughs and visions.

We should acknowledge this other dimension we carry. You, through your work—tell us a little about that.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I completely share what you’re saying. At the beginning of our series, I spoke in a professorial

mode about evidence for reincarnation. Our second conversation blended that with the wisdom arising from my

psychedelic work. Today I stand in that visionary side. I’m a psychedelic visionary. My understanding comes

from carefully distilled, conscientiously engaged non-ordinary states, returning again and again, purifying,

and allowing the universe to take me deeper—into itself and its intention—into time, into deep time. These

experiences were never intended just for me; they’re planted to be held and passed on. So I carry a feeling

for where history is going, and that gives me calm even as we enter difficult times.

**RICHARD RUDD:** I think both of us share the knowing that a birth is underway. We’re already in the canal and

the contractions have begun. Individual awakening often arrives through contractions—shudders, intensifications

of shadow, openings and closings—until an epiphany fires the DNA and changes you forever. I think that is

happening collectively. Your book, *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, beautifully describes coming down the

birth canal. We can’t fill in the details—time will—yet we can empathize with the suffering that is here and

likely to ramp up, while offering more than hope: a sense of purpose to present events.

**CHRIS BACHE:** You described how revelation in-breaks: deep insights can’t fit in small containers, so we are

purified—everything that keeps us small is burned up to allow the shattering, the death-rebirth cycle. We die to

what holds us and are reborn into a larger world. There are no shortcuts; the road is exacting. Yet its fruit is

both personal and collective. My work began as personal healing, but that was shattered early. I was drawn into

collective vistas—collective purifications and insights into our developmental process. Reincarnation is not only

an individual soul-journey; it is a species-journey. Generation after generation we evolve, and now the process is

coming to a crescendo—a profound breakthrough—a birth. We’re moving from egoic identity to soul awareness, where

former lives integrate into a fusion point—traumas healed, virtues gathered—culminating in an explosion of light,

a higher order of individuality, with a different communion with the intelligence of the universe. This will change

the archetypal architecture of the collective unconscious as profoundly as the brain expansion 200,000 years ago.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Many watching this have likely said yes to transmuting more shadow than one lifetime holds. I

remember dark days when the weight in my body felt insurmountable—endless heaviness. Over the years it lightened,

and I saw the tunnel’s end. If you feel that weight, it’s because you have the capacity and the love to burn

through it. Don’t lose hope. Also, when birth comes there is a break in continuity. History looks continuous, but

you can’t see beyond the break. Something completely new emerges, assembled out of all that came before but unlike

what preceded it. We are the technology—our DNA carries undreamed-of capacities. What’s coming bears little

resemblance to what has been.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I agree. Many serious practitioners are processing past-life karma and collective karma. Hidden

saints are working on behalf of humanity. We must move through this quickly—no one wants the fetus stuck in the

birth canal. Many souls chose to incarnate now to do the work of birthing a new humanity. In sessions, the pattern

is the same: deep descent into pain that seems endless, then a breaking point and surrender, followed by waking in

a new reality—not an extension of the old but a different genre of experience and capacity. My visions since 1991

show a turning point where the pace of the past can’t measure the future. After the transition we operate with a

different psycho-spiritual structure and generate a different civilization because we are different beings. The

egoic level, brilliant but fragmented, created our fractured relationship with nature. A soul-centered species with

a healed heart and open mind lives differently: it cares for the world it will return to and for relationships it

will meet again. Life gives us no option but transition—there’s no going back. The damage returns to us, demanding

something radically new. Some work outside; we work inside. All are needed.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Shakespeare’s comedies show everything snarled by Act IV before a strange attractor resolves the

plot at the end. We’ve had a long build-up to this mess, and then a catalytic energy arrives, resolving things in

unexpected ways. Boiling water is the simplest metaphor: nothing seems to happen, then the first bubbles, then an

eruption at a tipping point. Systems thinkers and mystics anticipate rapid change that can be destabilizing. We

don’t say this to alarm but to prepare. As inner birth unfolds, outer structures must decline to make way for the

new. That doesn’t mean we stop repairing what we can. Compassion involves passion—standing for what’s right while

serving as structures collapse. Safety means alignment with the soul’s destiny.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In my sessions, field dynamics were central. When energy pours into a system it moves far from

equilibrium. At bifurcation, it flips into a higher order. Humanity is a unified field of consciousness; each of us

is a fractal node. A global ecological crisis energizes the collective psyche like a pot coming to boil. Beneath our

individual 100-year cycles, the soul learns across lifetimes. Collectively, the species learns beneath generations

through archetypal structures. That deeper layer is reaching high energy. The sheer intensity of suffering and

anxiety pushes us to a breaking point, flooding us with a different common sense—new priorities, values, and

experience of each other. To go as far and as fast as needed we must grasp field dynamics in non-equilibrium. Crisis

builds until all seems lost; then it passes and we rise changed, with a fundamentally new organization of

consciousness. Things once hard become easy; possibilities multiply. I call this the birth of the future human—a

demarcation of a different kind of human being, seeded by reincarnation reaching fruition. The great beings of

history are prototypes—Christs, Buddhas, prophets—hinting at our collective becoming. The ecological crisis will

deepen for generations, but we will come through. In non-equilibrium, individual influence scales exponentially—the

butterfly effect. Whole individuals catalyze wholeness in others.

**RICHARD RUDD:** If one thing could change everything overnight, it would be seeing through the veil of death. When

that happens, fear is no more. As the collective “boils,” more people will retain memory across life, death, and

birth. That awakening is contagious—wisdom and love crackle in the air around such beings. As fear leaves person by

person, children can be born without the wound—born awake—through clear conduits of awakened parents. Awakened

consciousness will “colonize” the gene pool like a virus of love, non-denominational and everywhere. I’ve always

loved Jesus’ line: “I will return like a thief in the night.” The new human arrives quietly, unstoppably. One of my

favorite images from your book is the future human standing among seated Buddhas—no longer practicing to awaken,

but living awakened. The age of suffering gives way to learning through bliss—the white hole beyond the black hole.

Bliss has layers as deep as suffering. Keep that in heart and mind through difficult decades; we’ll be back to

enjoy the fruit. Don’t miss it.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Let’s look far into the future human. Our transformation is a new platform, not an endpoint. We’re

growing beyond learning through suffering and beyond fear of death. If I could give people one thing from my

sessions, it would be to lose that fear—death is graduation and respite. The divine project has brought us to this

crisis and will take us through. Nature has decided we’re ready. We’re here for a very long arc—millions of years.

At the end of my work I was given “diamond vision”—ten minutes of seeing a thousand times more clearly, with perfect

discrimination. It wasn’t a hallucination; it was seeing as the future human will see. Transformation will refine

heart, mind, and senses; touch, taste, vision, and hearing will grow exquisite. Consciousness will heal and uplift

the body into ecstatic creativity. We’re just beginning to activate higher potentials. The stakes are immense: we’re

not merely fixing humanity; we’re birthing a new order that becomes the platform for higher orders still. If our

nature is truly infinite, reincarnation gives infinite time to unfold it. Carefully qualified, we are learning to

create as gods—on scales we’ve only imagined in myth.

**RICHARD RUDD:** I’ve seen that too through another mythology: successive races or epochs evolving on Earth. We may

have forgotten earlier epochs because the breaks were so vast. Each portal includes and transcends what came before

and remembers more. This next phase culminates in our collective harmony with Gaia—taking our highest seat as her

consciousness and stewards, inseparable from the tiniest ant. We have not yet seen Gaia fully flowering. Each of us

has a unique weaving role—following our creativity to stitch specific pathways of Gaia’s tapestry. As we approach

perfection, time spirals tighter; at the final crystallization, time dissolves. My joke is: when you finally get to

heaven, everything stops—and yet it’s infinite time. Humanity then transcends humanity and moves spheres. Gaia rises

too; everything ratchets up because consciousness is embedded in all. Far ahead, the tapestries are vast and fractal

from galaxy to grain of sand. Through crisis, never leave the present or forget where we’re going. Grace is embedded

even in the bitter pill.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I love hearing you go. This solar system is part of a galaxy, of a super-cluster, of a universe

nested in meta-universes. Humanity’s transformation unfolds amid many species’ transformations around the galaxy.

We can affirm that while paying close attention to how we take full advantage of this growth opportunity. We choose

our incarnations. Everyone listening chose to be here now, planted exactly where they can have the greatest positive

impact. Look under your feet—your talents and relationships are already in place. Be fully here. Distractions will

multiply, but complete commitment to present circumstances is the fastest way through the hard part and into joy and

collaboration. We meet heaven only in the present. We may have wandered far from evidence for reincarnation, but

communion with the universe drives us both. Let go of what gets in the way and share the divine breath and joy as

deeply as possible in the years remaining—and in the next life, and the next.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Beautiful, Chris. I don’t think anything more needs to be said.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Maybe not here and now, but in another time and place we’ll wind it up again. I love our

discussions—what happens when we get together.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Me too. May our communities come together to explore and create proactive routes forward. Great

genius is being drawn to these conversations. When hearts join in service, much is possible.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Likewise. Much love and blessings in your work. It’s a joy to spend time with you; I receive much

from our conversations.

**RICHARD RUDD:** Likewise. Absolutely.

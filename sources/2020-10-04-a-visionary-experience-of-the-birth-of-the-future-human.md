Humanity stands at a pivotal threshold. Drawing on 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted between 1979 – 1999, philosopher **Chris Bache** outlines a sweeping vision of planetary crisis and collective awakening. He distinguishes five progressive domains of consciousness—from personal mind to diamond luminosity— and recounts revelations of species-wide metamorphosis: a unified field of humanity, divine love as the engine of evolution, and an imminent “great death–rebirth” catalyzed by ecological breakdown. Bache shares six core visions—divine love, all-humanity awareness, guiding intelligence, humanity as a single being, collective purification, and the future human—culminating in a 1995 “Great Awakening” vision depicting civilizational collapse followed by the birthing of a transpersonal “diamond soul.” A moderated Q&A explores the role of non-human life, implications for daily living, Christian parallels, and the time-scale of change. Listeners are invited to meet the coming turmoil with inner practice and outward service.

**JANET:** Welcome, everyone, to the Cambridge Consciousness Forum. Tonight we’re honored to host **Chris Bache**, whose 40-year career and 73 high-dose LSD sessions inform a powerful vision for our species’ future.

**CHRIS BACHE:** We are planted in crisis—this is very clear. Everyone knows the list of challenges: expanding world population, unchecked industrial pollution, escalating climate disruptions, increasing drought with forest fires, warmer oceans spawning stronger hurricanes, rising sea levels, collapsing water tables, species extinction, fished-out oceans, extreme economic inequality, unprecedented refugee migrations, unstable interlocked economies, cities and nations going bankrupt, stockpiled weapons we dare not use, and no end in sight. It is not an extreme statement to say we are a planet on fire. Subtract a few items or add a few more—cumulatively the list is overwhelming.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Today I want to share a perspective on this crisis that emerged from my psychedelic work, as reported in *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. First, some background to set the stage for the visions.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The material comes from *Diamonds from Heaven*. My lineage is Stan Grof’s tradition. Grof outlined two modes: low-dose psycholytic therapy, which uncovers the unconscious gradually, and high-dose psychedelic therapy, originally used to trigger near-death experiences in terminal patients.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I chose the high-dose path—500 to 600 micrograms. Between 1979 and 1999 I completed seventy-three such sessions. I would not casually recommend this protocol, yet my circumstances allowed it to remain deeply grounded. Every variable was held constant: same sitter, same room in northeast Ohio, same dose, same recording method.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Stabilizing set and setting created a powerful platform, granting clear access to deeper zones of consciousness. After each session I wrote a detailed record within twenty-four hours. Sustained work at this intensity triggers not one death-and-rebirth but many; each session begins where the last left off, revealing deeper strata.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I follow Grof’s terms—psychic, subtle, causal—though I have no stake in the map itself. The principle is simple: repeated surrender leads to progressively deeper structures of existence. Imagine LSD as a nuclear blast of the psyche: the shock wave reveals higher layers of atmosphere that were always there but unseen. Similarly, sustained practice uncovers discrete levels of consciousness, each with its own rules; we learn to acclimate to them.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Ultimately the journey is an entry into what I call the mind of the universe. Some would say God; I say cosmic mind. Across the sessions I traversed five primary levels: personal mind, species mind, archetypal mind, causal oneness, and diamond luminosity—the clear light of absolute reality.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Briefly, the book’s chapters mirror these levels. *Crossing the Boundary of Birth and Death* covers perinatal ego death. *Ocean of Suffering*, *Deep Time in the Soul*, and *Initiation into the Universe* belong to species mind. Beyond lie *The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality*, *Causal Oneness*, and *Diamond Luminosity*—four years, twenty-six sessions, but only four actual entries into the clear light. The rest were intense cleansing.

**CHRIS BACHE:** One chapter is missing from the table of contents: *The Birth of the Future Human*. These teachings unfolded over fifteen years, from session twenty-two through session seventy, and they surprised me. I expected personal enlightenment, yet the work proved profoundly collective. Tonight I will share two clusters of visions: Visions of Awakening, covering 1991-1994, and The Great Awakening, a single pivotal session in 1995.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The six themes inside Visions of Awakening are divine love, all-humanity awareness, guiding intelligence, our species as a single being, collective purification, and the future human. After those, we will enter the 1995 vision of humanity’s death-and-rebirth.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Let’s begin. I invite you to sit back, close your eyes, and listen with a receptive heart; the spoken word carries initiatory power beyond explanation.

**CHRIS BACHE:** First theme—divine love. I was taken to the dawn of creation and felt an all-encompassing cosmic love unlike anything I had known, and in that love I remembered that each of us freely volunteered to enter evolution; every hardship humans endure unfolds inside this love and becomes a noble offering to the universe’s creative intelligence.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Second theme—awareness of all humanity. From the turmoil of history a planet-wide consciousness is pushing upward, aiming to awaken the entire species, integrating the human family into a single field attuned to source; the sheer scale of that emergence stunned me.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Third theme—guiding intelligence. I saw humanity climbing from a deep valley toward a brilliant, sunlit world; although individuals cannot see the distant future, a higher intelligence within our species can and is deliberately preparing us, just as we winterize a home.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Fourth theme—our species as a single being. I experienced humanity as one organism whose diverse parts co-operate with extraordinary subtlety; energy webs would contract and flash into bursts of awareness, and those flashes are beginning to connect worldwide.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Fifth theme—collective purification. Like any organism reaching for greater consciousness, humanity must purge residues of its lower past; generations are crystallizing to embody our toxic legacy so it can be transformed, clearing space for deeper divine presence in future generations.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Sixth theme—the future human. In one session I was carried far into the future and briefly became the being we are evolving toward: clear, warm, whole, embodying oneness beneath diversity; spirit and matter held in perfect tantric balance; the experience filled me with rapture and calm delight.

**CHRIS BACHE:** These six themes recurred for four years, silently re-framing everything; they explained why we face an ocean of suffering but not how the collective leap would occur. My journey continued through the Benediction of Blessings and periodic entries into diamond luminosity, until one 1995 session diverted me into the death­-and-rebirth of our species.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In that session—The Great Awakening—after extensive cleansing I dissolved into species mind and witnessed a global crisis unfold with breathtaking speed: everyday structures collapsed, families scattered, humanity was reduced to raw survival, and yet just as extinction seemed certain the storm peaked and subsided; survivors formed new families and institutions that mirrored freshly discovered values, and awareness spiraled upward faster than anyone thought possible.

**CHRIS BACHE:** A refrain echoed throughout the vision: “This will happen faster than anyone can imagine.” Thousands of fractal images repeated the lesson that the tempo of the past no longer applies to the future.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Other sessions revealed reincarnation dynamics: all former lives converging into a “diamond soul,” releasing a burst of light that expands identity; ego yields to soul, and the small world of the present body-mind opens to the vast soul that moves freely through time.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In summary, humanity is entering a dark night of the collective soul—a multigenerational purification that will birth a higher order of human being; each of us chose to incarnate now to help midwife that birth.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you. We have time for questions; I’ll turn it back to Janet.

**JANET:** Thank you, Chris. Katie Carr, you’re first.

**KATIE CARR:** Chris, your visions feel anthropocentric. Where do non-human lives fit into this expanded consciousness?

**CHRIS BACHE:** My visions focused on humans because we are currently the planet’s most dangerous species; if we heal, all life benefits. The root problem lies in the human heart, and addressing it protects every other life-form.

**KATIE CARR:** After such revelations, what have you done these past twenty years?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Integration. Teaching until retirement, parenting, daily meditation, bodily care, and five years writing *Diamonds from Heaven*. Spirit told me, “Twenty years in, twenty years out,” and I published exactly twenty years after my last session.

**JANET:** Thank you, Katie. Jamie Mills, you’re next.

**JAMIE MILLS:** As a parent I wonder: will we witness more than the beginning of these changes in our lifetime?

**CHRIS BACHE:** My visions gave no timetable, only the mechanism. COVID-19 felt like an overture; multiple crises will follow. We may see the beginning but not the conclusion; our children and grandchildren will carry the work forward.

**JANET:** One final question—Claudia Schwartz Platsch.

**CLAUDIA SCHWARTZ PLATSCH:** Could the future human be akin to the Christian heaven, and did Christianity shape your path?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Raised Catholic, later influenced by Buddhism, I see heaven on earth as our destiny: awakening and incarnating divine consciousness here. Ego explodes into soul; the soul, enriched by many lifetimes, opens to cosmic mind. With minor adjustments this vision aligns with Christian hope.

**JANET:** Chris, thank you, and thanks to everyone for your thoughtful questions. *Session ends.*

This talk surveys empirical research on reincarnation and why it matters for how we live.

CHRIS BACHE frames the core philosophical questions—do we survive death, and do we live more

than once—arguing that “time as a teacher” changes the very purpose we ascribe to existence.

He then “goes large” across the literature: Ian Stevenson’s child cases and birthmark studies,

editorial recognitions in mainstream medical journals, and criticisms by philosopher Paul

Edwards with a counter-analysis by Robert Almeder. BACHE highlights contemporary continuations

(Tom Shroder, Jim Tucker) and contrasts spontaneous recall in children with evoked memories in

therapeutic settings (Roger Woolger, Winifred Lucas, Carol Bowman). He gives special attention

to Michael Newton’s work on life-between-lives decision-making and two accessible modern cases:

detective Robert Snow and the Leininger family’s “Soul Survivor.” He closes by clarifying what

we still don’t understand—the “physics” of rebirth—and a paradox: strong evidence liberates

our thinking while also narrowing it if we mistake atypical cases for the norm.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The good news—do I have a mic?—is that after me it’s lunch, so I’m the end of the unit.

I’m a professor and I’ve been at this game a long time, so I know a tired audience when I see one.

It’s been a long morning full of wonderful ideas. Let’s do something quick—everybody stand up and

stretch your arms. Bring in some good energy. Okay… now please sit.

**CHRIS BACHE:** The most important philosophical question one can ask is: Do we survive the death of the body?

A close second is: Do we live once or many times? Both hinge on time—time as a teacher. If I give a quiz,

I expect one kind of performance. If I give an hour exam, I expect more. A take-home paper? More still.

More time changes what can be learned and demonstrated.

**CHRIS BACHE:** If this magnificent universe has a purpose, we must measure that purpose against the time we have

to fulfill it. If we live once, we infer one meaning. If we live a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand lives—if

our participation is open-ended—our relationship to the universe changes, and so does the framework for purpose.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Many religions of the last four millennia have undervalued physical existence: achieve realization,

enlightenment, salvation—and then leave. Nirvana, escape samsara, attain moksha, exit. That leaves the question

of the universe’s purpose unanswered. But if we return—if we come back many times—a different story unfolds.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Our understanding of reincarnation is still incomplete. As our sense of the cosmos expands, so does our

sense of how long and how deeply we “dance” with it. Then we can ask what the universe may be accomplishing in us,

and what gift our compounded learning offers back to the universe.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Today I want to review evidence for reincarnation. I’ve been at this a long time. My first academic book,

*Life Cycles*, signals how important I think this topic is. What matters is that there is critical empirical

evidence. Fifty years ago this wasn’t true. Theologians debated endlessly. Today the evidence has moved the

discussion to psychologists, philosophers, and psychiatrists.

**CHRIS BACHE:** When weighing evidence, you can go small or go large. The beauty—the joy—is in detailed cases, but in forty-five

minutes I’ll go large. My goal is simple: inspire you to read one book on reincarnation you haven’t read.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Ian Stevenson’s *Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation* changed my life. Finishing graduate school in 1978,

I was an atheistically inclined agnostic. Stevenson convinced me there is evidence we live more than once. He was

the Carlson Professor at the University of Virginia and wrote extensively: multi-volume case series, studies of

xenoglossy, *Children Who Remember Previous Lives*, and his monumental two-volume work on birthmarks and birth defects

corresponding to the death wounds of previous personalities.

**CHRIS BACHE:** What are we looking at? Children around the world with detailed recall of a most recent life. They can navigate

towns they’ve never visited. When brought to the previous personality’s home, they recognize people, recall shared

histories, and display appropriate emotions—husbands to wives, parents to children. There are cases where a five-year-old

boy carries the affect of a 35-year-old husband.

**CHRIS BACHE:** One boy, reunited with the previous family, was shy around the former wife. After she left the room, he identified

her and later said, “I’ve come, but you haven’t fixed the bindi,” and he criticized her white sari—widow’s attire—implying

she should dress as a married woman again. In another case a child was asked, “If you’re my husband, where did you put the

will?” He walked to the kitchen, lifted a floorboard, and produced it. Cases like these drive my philosophical colleagues

up a wall. They don’t know what to do with them.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Patterns emerge. Average time between death of the first personality and the birth of the second is about two and a

half years. Average distance between life places is around fifty miles. Children tend to lose these memories by about eight

years old, with most of the rest fading at puberty.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Why do these children remember what most of us forget? We don’t know. Stevenson hypothesized that roughly sixty percent

who died violently, and many who died suddenly or with acute unfinished business, may be drawn back faster and closer, with

memories encoded more strongly.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Mainstream journals took note. *JAMA* wrote that Stevenson had painstakingly collected cases in which the evidence for

reincarnation is difficult to explain otherwise. The *Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease* devoted an issue to his work and,

in an editorial, affirmed the legitimacy of his methods and reasoning.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Of course there are critics. Philosopher Paul Edwards—editor-in-chief of the *Encyclopedia of Philosophy*—launched the

harshest critique, accusing Stevenson of poor rigor and implying fraud. But deeper in his logic he says reincarnation would be

a “crucifixion” of our secular understanding. He claims you must accept “collateral assumptions”: materialism is false, mind is

not reducible to brain, identity exceeds personality, there’s a domain beyond spacetime, death is not final, and life may have

a deeper logic. He deems these “fantastic,” and concludes a rational person must reject Stevenson’s facts or explain them away.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Robert Almeder analyzed this debate and shows Edwards doesn’t refute Stevenson; he refuses to consider the evidence on its

own terms, begging the question. If you can’t refute a commanding argument, refusing it is irrational.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Tom Shroder, a Pulitzer-winning reporter and *Washington Post* editor, traveled with Stevenson. His *Old Souls* applies a

reporter’s eye and finds the methods solid and the cases compelling. At UVA, Jim Tucker carries the work forward with accessible

overviews and careful rebuttals of weaker hypotheses.

**CHRIS BACHE:** So far, those are spontaneous memories. There’s also evoked memory—recall arising through methods like hypnotherapy, sometimes

even bodywork. Representative works include Roger Woolger’s *Other Lives, Other Selves*—intellectually robust, case-rich—and

Winifred Lucas’s two-volume *Regression Therapy: A Handbook for Professionals*, an early attempt to set standards in a rapidly

growing field.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Carol Bowman entered the field as a parent when her child’s nightmares pointed to unresolved trauma from a previous life.

Her books guide families through such cases, including within-family reincarnation—messier for research but common in lived

experience.

**CHRIS BACHE:** I have a special partiality for Michael Newton’s work, *Journey of Souls* and *Destiny of Souls*. As a therapist he discovered

that, in deep hypnosis, clients not only recall past lives but also describe the after-death state with striking consistency across

worldviews—from fundamentalist to Marxist to reductionist. They describe an ordered, pedagogical spirit world where older learners

teach younger, and where reincarnation is a deliberate choice made with guides and in coordination with future life partners.

Before we were born—when we knew more than we now remember—we chose the lives we are living.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Two accessible modern cases: Robert Snow, commander of homicide in Indianapolis, had an unexpected regression, then used

detective skills to verify *Looking for Carroll Beckwith*. And the Leininger family’s *Soul Survivor*: a young boy’s spontaneous

recall of a WWII pilot’s death led to verifications and, ultimately, the father’s reversal from adamant disbelief to acceptance.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Let me close with two points. First, what we don’t know is substantial. Even if the evidence is compelling, we don’t yet

understand the “physics” of rebirth. What is the soul? How does it interface with biology and genetics? How is learning encoded

and later carried forward? Progress here requires moving beyond reducing mind to brain and adopting a multi-dimensional cosmology.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Second, a paradox. Stevenson’s evidence liberates our thinking at one level, but can constrict it at another. His strongest

cases are atypical—fast returns, close to home. Most souls, so to speak, spend far more “time” in the timeless, with broader

experience. To fill in the larger canvas of dying, rebirth, and the cycles of contraction and expansion, we need multiple bodies

of data—Newton’s work, and this afternoon I’ll add perspectives from psychedelic research.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Thank you.

**HOST:** Chris, thank you so much. This is the kind of knowledge that changes how we live and how we meet each moment.

It’s at the core of our institute’s mission—real existential questions with a scientific basis. We need to bring

this to society to help shift consciousness. I’m very much looking forward to your next talk.

**Abstract**

In this wide-ranging conversation hosted by Embercombe’s *Contemporary Animism* series, philosopher and

psychedelic researcher **CHRIS BACHE** discusses his 20-year program of 73 high-dose LSD sessions

documented in *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*. Interviewers **RACHEL** and **COLIN** explore Bache’s

methodology, his concept of “diamond souls,” and the collective evolutionary crisis he calls the “dark

night of the species soul.” Bache explains how systematic, high-dose work accelerates purification,

opens access to transpersonal realms, and reveals an overarching intelligence guiding human

transformation. The dialogue touches on reincarnation, time, ecological activism, parenting, ritual

practice, and the role individual awakening plays in tipping collective consciousness toward a more

compassionate future. A Q&A with participants probes practical implications, the nature of time, and

ways to live one’s prophetic insights in daily life.

**RACHEL:** Welcome, everyone. It’s a beautiful evening here in Devon. Tonight we share an interview

with **CHRIS BACHE**, recorded for our *Contemporary Animism* program. Chris offers hope at a

moment when our species faces a collective dark night.

**RACHEL:** The talk lasts about 50 minutes. Watch as you wish, then stay for discussion.

Chris is Professor Emeritus of philosophy and religion, author of *Lifecycles*, *Dark Night, Early

Dawn*, and *LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, which outlines his research method. **COLIN** will

introduce him.

**COLIN:** Good evening. A year ago I found *Dark Night, Early Dawn* and was struck by its subtitle,

“Steps Toward a Deep Ecology of Mind.” We need a radical, experiential renewal of our relationship

with life. Chris’s work—building on Stan Grof—embodies that radical courage.

**CHRIS BACHE:** In animistic terms, nature is infused with consciousness. How large is that mind?

In 1978, fresh from graduate work in philosophy of religion, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s *Realms of

the Human Unconscious*. My life pivoted. Grof offered a safe, systematic way to explore deep

consciousness—where answers to our philosophical questions reside.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Starting in 1979 I embarked on a 20-year journey with high-dose LSD—73 sessions

following Grofian protocol: eyeshades, music, sitter, complete internal focus. High doses expanded

not only depth but breadth of consciousness, opening dialogue with an intelligence that dissolved

into deeper infinities whenever pressed for form.

**RACHEL:** Would anyone using your method reach similar unfoldings?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes and no. Psychedelics amplify consciousness; they don’t dictate content. Early

sessions mirror personal history. Persist past ego-death and individual stories converge into shared

spiritual terrain. Experience is participatory: our seed-mind catalyzes facets of the infinite, then

evolves and catalyzes again.

**RACHEL:** Your approach feels like a fast track.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Fast, but no bypassing. Purification that contemplatives stretch over years can

unfold in days—convulsions, vomiting, lifestyle overhaul. These immersions are temporary; abiding

integration requires daily practice. Crucially, the trajectory is not “up-and-out” but transcendence

in service of incarnation: letting more of the universe live through the historical body.

**CHRIS BACHE:** Halfway through, my personal-model shattered. I was drawn into collective

transformation. Former lives fused, igniting a diamond luminosity—an evolutionary template for the

human family. Reincarnation is the higher octave of evolution, generating “diamond souls” capable of

embodying centuries of wisdom, communing with nature, and downloading cosmic intelligence.

**COLIN:** Time puzzles me. If linearity dissolves, what of reincarnation?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Drop the arrow and you get multi-incarnation. I’ve tasted modalities where a hundred

thousand years pass in a minute, or where one may incarnate in any century. Yet within spacetime,

linear sequences serve learning. The universe hosts many temporal logics; we navigate several at

once.

**RACHEL:** What other qualities mark the diamond soul?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Complete healing of historical wounds, expansive compassion, sensory acuity orders

of magnitude beyond normal vision, and an effortless openness to divine genius. Earth becomes

heaven-in-body. But birth demands the death of egoic culture—our collective dark night. Each of us

carries a piece of the labor.

**CAROL:** Should we relax and trust, or strive for specific practice?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Each person’s life is a seed chosen before birth. Courageously living what is within

reach is the practice; it seeds the morphic field for all.

**CHRISTINA:** Many haven’t tasted these openings. Does the collective shift really exist?

**CHRIS BACHE:** Yes. Individual awakenings feed the web invisibly, just as ancestors nourished us.

When enough seeds sprout, uncommon sense becomes common.

**TERESA:** You replace Eastern transcendence with Western evolution. Could time-layers coexist

without goal?

**COLIN:** Our task is to rest where we are while plumbing ancestral cognition. Time may spiral,

yet we translate insights into present action.

**RACHEL:** We’ve only scratched the surface, but must close. Chris returns later in the program for

deeper exploration. Thank you all for staying the course.

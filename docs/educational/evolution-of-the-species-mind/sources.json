I don’t know how long this transition will take—at least generations. Whether it’s 100 years or several hundred, I don’t know. If it took 1,000 years, that’s probably stretching it, because I think we’ll be dead if we don’t make this transition sooner. We’re either going to go extinct or we’re going to transition into this new form. Extinction—or near extinction—is a tremendous accelerator of evolution. However long it takes, whatever we become, evolution isn’t going to stop. We’ve been at this for billions of years; we’ll be at this for billions more. There’s no telling where we might go next, and next after that. So I don’t see an end point—just the next point. And the next point is to wake up to what’s really going on, to who we really are, to the depth and breadth of our relationships with life itself, other people, and other species—and then we continue.\n\nSandy Sedgbeer:\nIt’s been 24 years since you stopped. Do you feel you have fully integrated all of those experiences?",

This is a really important question. I have friends who have spent a great deal of time at the interface of the human species and animal species, even immersing themselves into various animal species with various insights. My work has not been like that. It has been really focused on the human species, and I don’t know why, except for one thing: I think the human species is the most dangerous species on the planet right now. It is the imbalances of the human psyche that are placing the lives and well-being of other species in peril. If we can heal and make whole the human species, then the other species will be saved and safe on our planet.\n\nMy best understanding is that my work focuses on the human species not because it denies the importance of other species, but because it’s trying to get at the problem where it lives. Right now the problem lives inside the human heart and our insensitivity to the larger, deeper rhythms of life that we share with all other life forms on our planet.",

Where might we focus our intentions on a path forward?\nChris Bache\nAbout halfway through my journey, in the 38th session, in a year of enormous blessings, I was taken on an experience preceded by very intense purification—very intense death-rebirth processes. At one phase in this journey, I experienced all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before. I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives, and I’d already written a book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But this was different: my former lives began coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They hit a critical mass and fused. There was an explosion of energy, and all these separate lives fused into one life. A burst of diamond light came out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. Then I was given a lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening. It changed my understanding of how reincarnation works and where it’s taking us.",

        "text": "e case: a painful birth to transition into a more functional, balanced species. Could you elaborate?\nChris Bache: I explore this in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human,” and earlier in “The Great Awakening” in Dark Night, Early Dawn (2000). I was uncomfortable entering this territory at first—I’m not drawn to historical speculation. I began this work for individual healing and enlightenment, and that premise was blown away within a few years. The purification, the access to information and knowledge—everything seemed to be in service of the species as a whole. It’s not that our species is special in the universe, but the Divine’s focus here, now, seems species-wide.\n\nThis emphasis repeated so often and strongly that the gist of my 20-year journey became the collective story of death and rebirth. I have deep convictions that we’ve entered the dark night of our collective soul—a period of purification, confronting the sins of our fathers and mothers, which are our own through reincarnation. We’re facing our past choices and their consequences, purifying the toxins they left, to open into new dimensions of our being.",

I thought it was about personal transformation, even personal enlightenment. I never imagined that the evolution of the species would become such a dominant theme. Going back to about halfway through the work in the early ’90s, starting in 1991, I began to have a series of visions—just dropped into my sessions—that humanity was coming to a turning point, a true before-and-after point in history. We were entering a time of intense purification, essentially purifying the human psyche of the sins of our fathers—lifting the conditioning of the past to make us more receptive to, and capable of internalizing, the spiritual infusion, insights, and power becoming available at this time in history. There was a tremendous sense of rebirth coming.",

Please expand on that before we close.\nChris Bache:\nIn the 70th vision, I was given what I consider the last great vision of my journey; after that, it was wrapping up. I was taken into deep time and shown three core experiences. One was an insight into how humanity is designed for accelerated evolution. On the surface, we reincarnate: we learn, grow, change, make decisions, and return different. But beneath the incarnating self is a deeper structure that holds all our incarnational memories—a fundamental blueprint from which we act. Humanity grows and changes individually, while a very specific structure in the collective psyche accumulates and stores that information. Periodically, that deeper structure pivots—what I call a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. It’s the genius of creation: we learn individually, it collects at a deeper level, and when that deeper level shifts, all subsequent individual experience unfolds from that changed fundamental psyche. After the birth of the future human, all future incarnations of human beings will operate out of this transformed collective psyche—and the process continues. Individuals learn and grow; it’s collected at depth; that level learns and grows—like Rupert Sheldrake talks about morphogenic fields—an ongoing, continuously evolving process.",

The message was always the same: we’re coming to a turning point, a profound spiritual awakening—a before-and-after in human history. It involves tremendous collective purification, emptying out the pains of history to lay a new foundation for an infusion of divine energy rising within us. I was given glimpses of the transformed humanity that would emerge, but not how nature would pull it off.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1995, when I had transitioned to the Diamond Luminosity phase of my work, I expected to be taken back into that state. Instead, I was dissolved into the species—Chris Bache dissolved into the human family. As the human family, I was taken into the future—into deep time—and experienced what I came to understand as a death-and-rebirth process impacting the entire human family. Just as an individual can undergo an intense death–rebirth process in spiritual or psychedelic practice, history was putting the entire human family through such a process.",

Where do animals fit into this?\nChris Bache:\nOf course, many psychedelics open powerful experiences with animal species—the totems of various species, the planet filled with the minds of these beings—not just individual animals, but aggregates of mammalian mind and so on. That hasn’t been the thrust of my experience. Mine has really been working with human consciousness, but the nature of those experiences completely opens me to the reality of animal consciousness in many forms. I think the reason I’ve been focused on human consciousness—reasons not of my choosing, just being driven at a deeper level—is that humanity represents the greatest danger to life on this planet. We are the life destroyers. We are the driving force of the Sixth Extinction. If we can heal humanity, then all the other animals and life forms will be safe. That has been the focus of my work. Other people have been retrieving the consciousness story of other life forms—even rock, insect, bird, and fish life forms—absolutely essential work. It just hasn’t been my personal work.",

        "text": "e to say about the evolution of consciousness in a relational field and quantum leaps in that field.\nChris Bache:\nI don’t know. We know about emergence; things happen in jumps, we hit tipping points. We think we’re coming to an evolutionary tipping point. When people have near-death experiences, they go through exponential increases in awareness in a very short time. More than one author has suggested that the human race is coming to a collective near-death experience—a potential jumping point. If fields can tip in small groups—if we hit that at large scale, in darkness or early dawn—I’d say we have a long way to go and little time to get there. The only way we could possibly make that kind of evolutionary progress is by understanding field dynamics, because then we’re not trying to change seven billion minds—we only need to change one mind, and the seven billion experiences are being processed at an integral level. If we understand nonlinear systems, and hypothesize the human collective unconscious as such a system, then when it’s thrown into far-from-equilibrium conditions, things can happen fast; there can be jumps. I really think that some dynamic like that underlies humanity’s potential for quantum change. It’s not simply an aggregate of individuals—there’s a deeper summation coming from all those individuals.",

        "text": ". These are the voices of our ancestors alive in us as we become the ancestors of our future selves.\nNick Mather\nYou write that evolution grows species, while reincarnation grows individuals. There seems to be a linkage between human evolution as a species and individual reincarnation. Can you say more?\n\nChris Bache\nI think of reincarnation as the higher octave of evolution. Evolution, as science tells us, develops whole species. Somewhere along the way, nature—or the intelligence behind nature—figured out how to evolve individuals within highly developed species. As individuality emerges, individuals make choices, and those choices influence their learning. Once that cycle is established, cause and effect shapes not just the physiology of species but the psychophysiology of individuals. Reincarnation is evolution reaching a point where it involves individuals and evolves their consciousness.\n\nNick Mather\nThis model seems to avoid the issue of an external intelligent design. It sounds like we actively drive evolution through this cycle. Is that right?",

I believe it is open “from below” to the individual psyches of its members, as Sheldrake suggests, but I also see it as open “from above” to more inclusive fields of consciousness. It not only learns from its individual members, it is also informed by more encompassing levels of consciousness, as suggested by the sessions reported in this chapter. This throws new light on the problem of creativity, which is a problem that Sheldrake has acknowledged his theory cannot solve. As many highly creative people have reported, deep creativity is often experienced as an infusion from above, and I suspect that something like this takes place higher up the Great Chain of Being as well.",

From Sheldrake’s perspective, the collective psyche, or species-mind, influences its individual members, as Jung suggests. But Sheldrake goes further than Jung in proposing that the collective psyche also receives and integrates the learning of its members. Sheldrake envisions a complex feedback loop operating between the species-mind and individuals that allows the species-mind to learn as its members learn. Collective learning progresses more slowly than individual learning, but when the species-mind eventually grasps a truth, the resulting shift ripples through the entire species resulting in faster learning curves.",

One portion of these rhythms is the collective psyche of our species. At the subtle level of consciousness, we can dissolve into the human species-mind so deeply that the beginnings and endings of our personal life become insignificant.

If we leave again, this time for a million years, upon our return we would find the same thing—Nature growing humanity into ever richer forms. In such a universe, how could life not eventually produce fully awakened Souls on Earth? Not just a few here and there, but everyone everywhere.

If we can open to the suffering of others in our psychedelic sessions and impact that suffering to some degree, how does it happen that the individual ever completes his or her work at this level while the suffering of the species-mind continues?",

It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.",

While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less.

I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives, and I’d already written a book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But this was different: my former lives began coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They hit a critical mass and fused. There was an explosion of energy, and all these separate lives fused into one life. A burst of diamond light came out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. Then I was given a lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening.

On the surface, we reincarnate: we learn, grow, change, make decisions, and return different. But beneath the incarnating self is a deeper structure that holds all our incarnational memories—a fundamental blueprint from which we act. Humanity grows and changes individually, while a very specific structure in the collective psyche accumulates and stores that information. Periodically, that deeper structure pivots—what I call a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. It’s the genius of creation: we learn individually, it collects at a deeper level, and when that deeper level shifts, all subsequent individual experience unfolds from that changed fundamental psyche. After the birth of the future human, all future incarnations of human beings will operate out of this transformed collective psyche—and the process continues.

It involves tremendous collective purification, emptying out the pains of history to lay a new foundation for an infusion of divine energy rising within us. I was given glimpses of the transformed humanity that would emerge, but not how nature would pull it off.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1995, when I had transitioned to the Diamond Luminosity phase of my work, I expected to be taken back into that state. Instead, I was dissolved into the species—Chris Bache dissolved into the human family. As the human family, I was taken into the future—into deep time—and experienced what I came to understand as a death-and-rebirth process impacting the entire human family. Just as an individual can undergo an intense death–rebirth process in spiritual or psychedelic practice, history was putting the entire human family through such a process.",

Where do animals fit into this?\nChris Bache:\nOf course, many psychedelics open powerful experiences with animal species—the totems of various species, the planet filled with the minds of these beings—not just individual animals, but aggregates of mammalian mind and so on. That hasn’t been the thrust of my experience. Mine has really been working with human consciousness, but the nature of those experiences completely opens me to the reality of animal consciousness in many forms. I think the reason I’ve been focused on human consciousness—reasons not of my choosing, just being driven at a deeper level—is that humanity represents the greatest danger to life on this planet. We are the life destroyers. We are the driving force of the Sixth Extinction. If we can heal humanity, then all the other animals and life forms will be safe. That has been the focus of my work. Other people have been retrieving the consciousness story of other life forms—even rock, insect, bird, and fish life forms—absolutely essential work. It just hasn’t been my personal work.",

We know about emergence; things happen in jumps, we hit tipping points. We think we’re coming to an evolutionary tipping point. When people have near-death experiences, they go through exponential increases in awareness in a very short time. More than one author has suggested that the human race is coming to a collective near-death experience—a potential jumping point. If fields can tip in small groups—if we hit that at large scale, in darkness or early dawn—I’d say we have a long way to go and little time to get there. The only way we could possibly make that kind of evolutionary progress is by understanding field dynamics, because then we’re not trying to change seven billion minds—we only need to change one mind, and the seven billion experiences are being processed at an integral level. If we understand nonlinear systems, and hypothesize the human collective unconscious as such a system, then when it’s thrown into far-from-equilibrium conditions, things can happen fast; there can be jumps. I really think that some dynamic like that underlies humanity’s potential for quantum change. It’s not simply an aggregate of individuals—there’s a deeper summation coming from all those individuals.",

These are the voices of our ancestors alive in us as we become the ancestors of our future selves.\nNick Mather\nYou write that evolution grows species, while reincarnation grows individuals. There seems to be a linkage between human evolution as a species and individual reincarnation. Can you say more?\n\nChris Bache\nI think of reincarnation as the higher octave of evolution. Evolution, as science tells us, develops whole species. Somewhere along the way, nature—or the intelligence behind nature—figured out how to evolve individuals within highly developed species. As individuality emerges, individuals make choices, and those choices influence their learning. Once that cycle is established, cause and effect shapes not just the physiology of species but the psychophysiology of individuals. Reincarnation is evolution reaching a point where it involves individuals and evolves their consciousness.\n\nNick Mather\nThis model seems to avoid the issue of an external intelligent design. It sounds like we actively drive evolution through this cycle. Is that right?",

At one phase, I had the experience of all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before and was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives. I’d already written the book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But I began to experience my former lives coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They seemed to hit a critical mass, and when they did, they fused. There was an explosion of energy and all these separate lives fused into one life. There was an explosion of diamond light out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. I was then given a whole lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening.

While there’s a growing appreciation, awareness, and thirst for spiritual truth and encounter, it isn’t necessarily expressing itself as an increase in religiosity or religious participation. I think the religions we have today largely did the bulk of the work they were charged to do. When you consider the breadth of human evolution—hundreds of thousands of years of growing and growing—and then notice religions rarely last more than a few thousand years, the idea that a religion, if true, is eternally true doesn’t seem realistic. More likely, a religion helps a reincarnating humanity go from A to B. When we arrive at B, there’s still so much further to go, and it requires a new set of insights, a new inspiration, a new vision to take us from B to C, and later from C to D. I think we’re at a phase where the vision that brought us here isn’t sufficient for where we need to go next.",

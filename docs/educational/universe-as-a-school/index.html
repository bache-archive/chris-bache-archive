      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In deep psychedelic work, <em>one learns by becoming</em>. This is especially true when working with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. We cannot transport the egoic self into these depths where it can then “have an experience” of how the world works there. In order to know the universe at these levels, we must <em>become</em> a citizen of these levels. We must <em>become</em> the levels themselves. To do this, our smaller sense of self must cease to be the container of our experience. It must die. Giving up everything is simply the price of inheriting everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.8 §1 ¶49</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the final analysis, I think that whether we remain inside the physical universe after waking up spiritually or leave it behind are not mutually exclusive options but simultaneous possibilities. If we were to achieve enlightenment and leave spacetime for one hundred thousand years and then return, we would find the universe continuing to patiently grow her children through the steady and relentless accumulation of experience in rebirth. If we leave again, this time for a million years, upon our return we would find the same thing—Nature growing humanity into ever richer forms. In such a universe, how could life not eventually produce fully awakened Souls on Earth? Not just a few here and there, but everyone everywhere. An entire species that through its hard labor has given birth to its next self-expression—a fully conscious Soul, green to its roots, feet firmly planted on the Earth but now transparent to the Creative Intelligence that everywhere presses in upon it. This is the vision of history I now turn to explore.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>I have an acute sense that the universe loves to be known—the universe wants to be known. We are part of its knowing. When we return to source… it wants to show you creation, show you what has been going on.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yewNM9smrqo?t=1556">00:25:56</a>  — <em>Diamonds from Heaven – Interview with Iain McNay</em> (2018-07-05) • 00:25:56</p>
<p>Did you have a teacher during all of this?<br />
<strong>Chris Bache:</strong> No, I consider the universe my only teacher. …I kept being dissolved into levels of being… opening into vast expanses of consciousness and learning how the universe works…<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/B0BhUOEP1Mg?t=2098">00:34:58</a>  — <em>Bicycle Day Conversation with Jef Baker</em> (2020-04-19) • 00:34:58</p>
<p>Consciousness is like an infinite ocean… our mind is a seed-catalyst dropped into this ocean… by absorbing… we’re changed… Then, when we drop that changed mind back… it triggers an even deeper set of experiences… I experienced myself as engaging an intelligence… that was directing my sessions.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/mG1uyBw0ucg?t=288">00:04:48</a>  — <em>Diamonds from Heaven: Exploring the Mind of the Universe</em> (2023-07-12) • 00:04:48</p>
<p>I collect images of galaxies and nebulas… But what I’m referring to is not the outer body of the divine… I’m talking about the consciousness of the universe… I would love… a protocol: one day a month for two years—what body of knowledge they would return with and share.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/hr0nxquWvgQ?t=3829">01:03:49</a>  — <em>LSD &amp; the Mind of the Universe (SMN webinar)</em> (2022-12-07) • 01:03:49</p>
<p><strong>Emmy Vadnais:</strong> What are some of the teachings you received?<br />
<strong>Chris Bache:</strong> That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness… Creation is intentional… Reincarnation is a fact of life… There is an underlying logic to our circumstances…<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FMgixG6Z0sk?t=1882">00:31:22</a>  — <em>Psychedelics and the Cosmic Mind</em> (2025-03-18) • 00:31:22</p>
<p>The religions… are examples of what I would call an up-and-out cosmology… But that leaves… What is the purpose of the universe? …it becomes profoundly unacceptable… to think the purpose of life is to awaken… and then escape…<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/2Trb-vC8zc0?t=2126">00:35:26</a>  — <em>LSD &amp; the Mind of the Universe (What Is Going OM)</em> (2023-08-17) • 00:35:26</p>
<p>The core teaching of <em>The Living Classroom</em>: consciousness is unified from the start… Everything we do… radiates 360 degrees… Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/-vebDk9FRYU?t=8206">02:16:46</a>  — <em>Edge of Mind Podcast – Part 2</em> (2022-06-03) • 02:16:46</p>
<p>We are clearly part of the creative experiment that the universe is—an aspect of it, not separate from it… Sink into the depths of your mind… you encounter an intelligence of stunning vastness… We are fortunate to be cells within this body of divine self-manifestation…<br />

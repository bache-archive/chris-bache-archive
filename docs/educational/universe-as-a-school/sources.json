We are clearly part of the creative experiment that the universe is—an aspect of it, not separate from it. Our body—the cells of our biology—arises out of this evolutionary masterpiece. Our mind, like our body, derives from the universe. We’re taught the universe is a machine that moves with blindness, evolving through random variation and selection, but that’s an incomplete story. Sink into the depths of your mind and you drop out of personal mind into deeper layers—the species mind, then a solar system or galactic mind. As you drop into that, you encounter an intelligence of stunning vastness, with a depth of love and compassion behind it. That intelligence manifests the universe as its own self‑expression. We are fortunate to be cells within this body of divine self‑manifestation, fractally embedded in it, our story part of its story and vice versa.",

        "text": "he universe is galaxies, stars, vast physical space. What do you mean by “universe” in your account?\nChris Bache\nYou’re absolutely right to press me on this. I struggle with language to describe these realities. I don’t like using the word “God”—it carries so much historical baggage and usually doesn’t mean what I mean. Sometimes I use “the divine,” but that can be a bit of a ruse because it comes back to the same issue. I collect images of galaxies and nebulas and play them in meditation because this is my divine; it’s what I’m orienting to. But what I’m referring to is not the outer body of the divine, though I was taken into exploring some of the body of the universe. I’m talking about the consciousness of the universe—the consciousness that has given birth to the universe. I’m just scraping the edges of it, touching pieces of it, and my experience is limited by what I can understand. I often wish I had degrees in astrophysics and quantum theory; this consciousness could have shown me so much more if my mind were tuned to that type of knowledge. What I would love is to have a hundred of our best scientists, artists, and social activists going into these states in a systematic fashion. Imagine a protocol: one day a month for two years—what body of knowledge they would return with and share. It’s never the experience of any one individual that’s most important; it’s our collective genius engaged together.",

Tell us what you discovered.\nChris Bache\nAs I came to experience it, consciousness is like an infinite ocean. When we open ourselves in deep psychedelic states, it’s as if our mind is a seed-catalyst dropped into this ocean, and it crystallizes a set of experiences out of this infinite potential. By absorbing and internalizing what we’re being offered—what we’re being taught—we’re changed, purified, transformed inwardly. Then, when we drop that changed mind back into the infinite potential, it triggers an even deeper set of experiences from its infinity.\n\nI experienced myself as engaging an intelligence—a consciousness—that was directing my sessions. I did not control what was unfolding. I was always yielding and following a lead that came from deeper levels of consciousness. As the journey continued, the levels of consciousness I was entering deepened multiple times.",

        "text": "cy. You say the universe is interested in our experience of it. Why do you believe that is the case?\nChris Bache:\nPart of my experience reflects a classic teaching in some Eastern traditions: the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality—Atman is Brahman. Our nature is the nature of the divine, which is the nature of reality itself. So it’s not completely accurate to frame this as a duality between me and It. At a deeper level, my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality. Our relationship is deeply essential and mutually participating from the start. But functionally, in terms of Chris Bache, I am so small and It is so vast that there’s a relative duality involved. And between my small bit and the totality are layers upon layers. It’s a very complex, organic system of massive scale.",

Other people may have those experiences. I was given a session I called the “Cosmic Tour,” where I was shown many things, much of which I couldn’t reproduce when I came back into time-space consciousness, because I didn’t have the vocabulary or intellectual tools to articulate them. I’ve often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics to better articulate some of what I was given. But I didn’t spend a lot of time traveling within time and space.

Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.",

I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.",

From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.",

Is that a fair representation?\nChris Bache\nIt is, and that description fits better in the early stages, when you’re working at insights that help you understand your individual way of being in the world. I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown. The universe can only communicate to you what you have the capacity to understand.",

        "text": "en the universe at large—the physical universe—and us as agents at the leading edge of this process?\nChris Bache:\nYou’re asking good questions. Let me step back and put this in context. All the religions of the last 5,000 years—the Axial Age—came into existence when we first began to get beneath individual consciousness and tap into spiritual consciousness, the consciousness of the universe or the Divine. The religions of this era, both Western and Eastern, are examples of what I would call an up-and-out cosmology. I understand their intention: when you experientially touch your divine essence, it is so ecstatic and blissful—so much more satisfying than physical existence—that how could you not think you belong there more than here? So the theologies born in this period are theologies of return. They basically say we don’t belong on Earth; we belong in heaven. Somehow, through misfortune or punishment, we’re here, but what we should do is get out of here and go back there—whether through Western concepts of salvation or Eastern concepts of reincarnation leading to moksha, escape back to spiritual paradise.",

One adventure after another, deeper and deeper. I have an acute sense that the universe loves to be known—the universe wants to be known. We are part of its knowing. When we return to source, when we begin that journey back to point of origin, we are met by a massive supreme intelligence, extraordinary compassion and loving beyond imagination. And it is so happy that part of itself has come back to experience and know it. It wants to show you creation, show you what has been going on. The universe has been working for billions of years, and we are just now—over the last few thousand years—beginning to open deeply enough to consciously participate and see the creative process.

One unusual feature of my experiences, compared to others I've spoken with, is that I didn’t have much contact with individual beings, which are so common in the DMT experience. Over time I pondered why. I kept being dissolved into levels of being, then dissolved into deeper levels, opening into vast expanses of consciousness and learning how the universe works—not by engaging discrete beings who live on those levels.

One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.",

If we were to achieve enlightenment and leave spacetime for one hundred thousand years and then return, we would find the universe continuing to patiently grow her children through the steady and relentless accumulation of experience in rebirth. If we leave again, this time for a million years, upon our return we would find the same thing—Nature growing humanity into ever richer forms. In such a universe, how could life not eventually produce fully awakened Souls on Earth? Not just a few here and there, but everyone everywhere. An entire species that through its hard labor has given birth to its next self-expression—a fully conscious Soul, green to its roots, feet firmly planted on the Earth but now transparent to the Creative Intelligence that everywhere presses in upon it.

They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can.

While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less.

All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.",

Is that a fair representation?\nChris Bache\nIt is, and that description fits better in the early stages, when you’re working at insights that help you understand your individual way of being in the world. I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown. The universe can only communicate to you what you have the capacity to understand.",

Let me step back and put this in context. All the religions of the last 5,000 years—the Axial Age—came into existence when we first began to get beneath individual consciousness and tap into spiritual consciousness, the consciousness of the universe or the Divine. The religions of this era, both Western and Eastern, are examples of what I would call an up-and-out cosmology. I understand their intention: when you experientially touch your divine essence, it is so ecstatic and blissful—so much more satisfying than physical existence—that how could you not think you belong there more than here? So the theologies born in this period are theologies of return. They basically say we don’t belong on Earth; we belong in heaven. Somehow, through misfortune or punishment, we’re here, but what we should do is get out of here and go back there—whether through Western concepts of salvation or Eastern concepts of reincarnation leading to moksha, escape back to spiritual paradise.",

One adventure after another, deeper and deeper. I have an acute sense that the universe loves to be known—the universe wants to be known. We are part of its knowing. When we return to source, when we begin that journey back to point of origin, we are met by a massive supreme intelligence, extraordinary compassion and loving beyond imagination. And it is so happy that part of itself has come back to experience and know it. It wants to show you creation, show you what has been going on. The universe has been working for billions of years, and we are just now—over the last few thousand years—beginning to open deeply enough to consciously participate and see the creative process. It’s so happy when we do that.",

One unusual feature of my experiences, compared to others I've spoken with, is that I didn’t have much contact with individual beings, which are so common in the DMT experience. Over time I pondered why. I kept being dissolved into levels of being, then dissolved into deeper levels, opening into vast expanses of consciousness and learning how the universe works—not by engaging discrete beings who live on those levels. The closest I came to “beings,” as such, was in archetypal reality, but those realities were so large that the best my mind could do was image them as galaxies—billions of light-years across.

But the core truth manifesting there—without mentioning psychedelics—is that consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do in our individual field radiates 360 degrees. All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us. That’s the core teaching of The Living Classroom: there’s an atomistic quality to teaching, and a quantum quality. You and I have been having, in some ways, an atomistic conversation, but we can trust that there’s a quantum quality to it.",

The deeper your experience of the intelligence of life and the joy of its creative manifestation, the more you see the universe for what it is—the body of the Divine, the body of God. The universe manifests a profound intelligence. Once you touch that, you’re overwhelmed by its brilliance, wisdom, and love—an order of love beyond anything I’d known in this lifetime.\n\nThose experiences change how you see everything.

In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.",

For what point—what is the ultimate purpose of all of this happening?\nChris Bache:\nLet me break that down into two parts—the classical vision, first, on reincarnation. In most Eastern traditions, you grow, get clearer, kinder, more generous, cultivate deeper qualities, and eventually reach a spiritual maturing where your consciousness opens to the core of your being. You awaken to the fact that the essence of your nature is the essence of all nature, that all beings share the same nature. There’s an explosion of compassion and a deep embrace of the universe. The usual interpretation is that you are now free to leave time and space—what the Hindus call Moksha—to escape Samsara. It’s an “up and out” cosmology. The religions of the Axial Age, in one way or another, are part of that pattern: we don’t want to be on Earth, we’re in a veil of tears, we want out—by salvation or enlightenment. But that leaves fundamentally unexplained: What is the purpose of the universe? What is the purpose of this magnificent creation? With our deeper understanding of the magnitude of existence—how many billions of years went into the unfolding of the universe—it becomes profoundly unacceptable and short-sighted to think the purpose of life is to awaken to your true nature and then escape into nirvana or an off-planet paradise.",

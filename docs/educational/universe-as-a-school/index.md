> Christopher M. Bache is a scholar and author known for his exploration of consciousness and the intersection of psychedelic experiences with cosmological themes. His work delves into the nature of reality, suggesting that individual consciousness is intertwined with a greater universal intelligence. Bache's writings emphasize the transformative potential of psychedelics in expanding awareness and understanding the cosmos as a dynamic, evolving entity. Through his research, he invites readers to reconsider the relationship between the self and the universe.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶7 (1 · 8)**

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)**

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)**

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶49 (8 · 1)**

> In the final analysis, I think that whether we remain inside the physical universe after waking up spiritually or leave it behind are not mutually exclusive options but simultaneous possibilities. If we were to achieve enlightenment and leave spacetime for one hundred thousand years and then return, we would find the universe continuing to patiently grow her children through the steady and relentless accumulation of experience in rebirth. If we leave again, this time for a million years, upon our return we would find the same thing—Nature growing humanity into ever richer forms. In such a universe, how could life not eventually produce fully awakened Souls on Earth? Not just a few here and there, but everyone everywhere. An entire species that through its hard labor has given birth to its next self-expression—a fully conscious Soul, green to its roots, feet firmly planted on the Earth but now transparent to the Creative Intelligence that everywhere presses in upon it. This is the vision of history I now turn to explore.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)**

> LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶101 (6 · 0)**

> In the Cosmic Tour, I had explored the universe as a reality outside myself; in this session, I explored the universe as a dimension of my own being. This shift reflects the broader transition that takes place as one moves from the subtle level of consciousness, with dualism intact, into nondual causal consciousness. The peace of returning to the Oneness that swallows all partitions awakened a seed of remembering that changed me deeply, not instantaneously, but slowly over many years.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)**

> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶3 (12 · 3)**

> That the universe is the manifest body of a Divine Being of unimaginable intelligence, compassion, clarity, and power, that we are all aspects of this Being, never separated from it for a moment, that we are growing ever more aware of this connection, that physical reality emerges out of Light and returns to Light continuously, that Light is our essential nature and our destiny, that all life moves as One, that reincarnation is true, that there is a deep logic and significance to the circumstances of our lives, that everything we do contributes to the evolution of the whole, that our awareness continues in an ocean of time and a sea of bliss when we die, that we are loved beyond measure and that humanity is driving towards an evolutionary breakthrough that will change us and life on this planet at the deepest level. (Bache 2017)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶6 (1 · 12)**

> In deep psychedelic work, *one learns by becoming*. This is especially true when working with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. We cannot transport the egoic self into these depths where it can then “have an experience” of how the world works there. In order to know the universe at these levels, we must *become* a citizen of these levels. We must *become* the levels themselves. To do this, our smaller sense of self must cease to be the container of our experience. It must die. Giving up everything is simply the price of inheriting everything else.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶13 (2 · 2)**

> As the negative perinatal experiences continued to build over the next several sessions, so did the positive experiences that emerged during the ecstatic portion of the sessions. In one session, I experienced life as a living fabric of interwoven intelligences—atomic, molecular, cellular, human, societal, and planetary. This early taste of the weave of Oneness was just a metaphysical appetizer for the deeper experiences of Oneness that would follow later, so I will not spend time on it. I would, however, like to share one experience from this period because it speaks to the rationale for this book as a whole. This session helped me let go of my conventional academic training and embrace psychedelics as anew method of philosophical inquiry.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶85 (6 · 0)**

> As my experience of this seamless universe progressed, I came to discover that I was not exploring a universe “out there,” as I had in session 19, but a universe that “I” in some essential way already was. These experiences were leading me step-by-step into a deeper embrace of my own reality. I was exploring the universe as a dimension of my own existence, slowly remembering aspects of my being that I had lost contact with. This exploration seemed to answer a cosmic need not only to know but also to be known.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶18 (8 · 1)**

> The experiences reported in this book took place in the privacy of my home, but there was a second side to this story that took place at my university. In this section, I’d like to briefly describe a series of experiences that surfaced in my classroom while I was doing my psychedelic work. It took me years to understand these experiences and to comprehend their full implications. They became such a significant part of my teaching experience that I eventually wrote a small book about them. I hope this short introduction will encourage readers to read that more complete treatment. This is the backstory to *The Living Classroom* (2008).

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §7 ¶13 (5 · 7)**

> In this spiritual universe, Souls exist in a wide variety of conditions that reflect their stage of development. All of these conditions are blissful compared with life on Earth and there is no hell. We may experience episodes of intense suffering during our debriefing as we experience the pain we caused others, but Newton reports that there is no eternal damnation in the afterlife and no pits of fire. Instead, there is accountability combined with the opportunity to continue learning and growing in a variety of settings. At all the levels of this spiritual universe, senior learners help junior learners. It is their work and their joy to do so.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶5 (1 · 5)**

> All my life I have had a passionate desire to understand how our universe works. Why are our lives the way they are? Why is there so much suffering in life? Is there a larger intelligence operating in the universe, and if so, toward what end? What is the purpose and project of existence? In our culture’s current materialist paradigm that reduces everything to physical matter, these questions are considered beyond the pale of genuine knowledge, and attempts to answer them are seen as being purely speculative enterprises. In my sessions, however, I was given the opportunity to explore these questions in exercises of profound experiential instruction choreographed by a vast intelligence. I was shown things that stunned and transfixed me, was allowed to experience things that completely reframed my understanding of existence. What philosopher could turn down such an opportunity?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §0 ¶32 (8 · 0)**

> Reduced to its essence the teaching was this: Matter is the canvas that mind paints upon. It has no capacity to act apart from the animating presence of consciousness and is responsive to the direction of consciousness. Therefore, whatever our experience is in spacetime, we must have the courage to sit still and face the fact that we are experiencing nothing but the manifestation of our own consciousness. No matter how terrible the pain, no matter how horrendous the injustice or inscrutable the logic, our experience in space-time is the direct expression of our consciousness in a higher order of reality.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶21 (1)**

> Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book *The Cosmic Game*. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.

## Supporting transcript quotes (verbatim)

> ich the universe gets to experience itself in a way it otherwise wouldn’t? What do you think we are?
Chris Bache: That question has many levels, depending on how we frame it. We are clearly part of the creative experiment that the universe is—an aspect of it, not separate from it. Our body—the cells of our biology—arises out of this evolutionary masterpiece. Our mind, like our body, derives from the universe. We’re taught the universe is a machine that moves with blindness, evolving through random variation and selection, but that’s an incomplete story. Sink into the depths of your mind and you drop out of personal mind into deeper layers—the species mind, then a solar system or galactic mind. As you drop into that, you encounter an intelligence of stunning vastness, with a depth of love and compassion behind it. That intelligence manifests the universe as its own self‑expression. We are fortunate to be cells within this body of divine self‑manifestation, fractally embedded in it, our story part of its story and vice versa.

> he universe is galaxies, stars, vast physical space. What do you mean by “universe” in your account?
Chris Bache
You’re absolutely right to press me on this. I struggle with language to describe these realities. I don’t like using the word “God”—it carries so much historical baggage and usually doesn’t mean what I mean. Sometimes I use “the divine,” but that can be a bit of a ruse because it comes back to the same issue. I collect images of galaxies and nebulas and play them in meditation because this is my divine; it’s what I’m orienting to. But what I’m referring to is not the outer body of the divine, though I was taken into exploring some of the body of the universe. I’m talking about the consciousness of the universe—the consciousness that has given birth to the universe. I’m just scraping the edges of it, touching pieces of it, and my experience is limited by what I can understand. I often wish I had degrees in astrophysics and quantum theory; this consciousness could have shown me so much more if my mind were tuned to that type of knowledge. What I would love is to have a hundred of our best scientists, artists, and social activists going into these states in a systematic fashion. Imagine a protocol: one day a month for two years—what body of knowledge they would return with and share. It’s never the experience of any one individual that’s most important; it’s our collective genius engaged together.

> I’m not sure everyone can track with you there—the universe has a mind? Tell us what you discovered.
Chris Bache
As I came to experience it, consciousness is like an infinite ocean. When we open ourselves in deep psychedelic states, it’s as if our mind is a seed-catalyst dropped into this ocean, and it crystallizes a set of experiences out of this infinite potential. By absorbing and internalizing what we’re being offered—what we’re being taught—we’re changed, purified, transformed inwardly. Then, when we drop that changed mind back into the infinite potential, it triggers an even deeper set of experiences from its infinity.

I experienced myself as engaging an intelligence—a consciousness—that was directing my sessions. I did not control what was unfolding. I was always yielding and following a lead that came from deeper levels of consciousness. As the journey continued, the levels of consciousness I was entering deepened multiple times.

> cy. You say the universe is interested in our experience of it. Why do you believe that is the case?
Chris Bache:
Part of my experience reflects a classic teaching in some Eastern traditions: the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality—Atman is Brahman. Our nature is the nature of the divine, which is the nature of reality itself. So it’s not completely accurate to frame this as a duality between me and It. At a deeper level, my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality. Our relationship is deeply essential and mutually participating from the start. But functionally, in terms of Chris Bache, I am so small and It is so vast that there’s a relative duality involved. And between my small bit and the totality are layers upon layers. It’s a very complex, organic system of massive scale.

> r universe—the physical universe, space, outer space? Did you traverse that aspect in your sessions?
Chris Bache:
I wasn’t taken on journeys into our galaxy or other galaxies—that just wasn’t part of the work for me. Other people may have those experiences. I was given a session I called the “Cosmic Tour,” where I was shown many things, much of which I couldn’t reproduce when I came back into time-space consciousness, because I didn’t have the vocabulary or intellectual tools to articulate them. I’ve often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics to better articulate some of what I was given. But I didn’t spend a lot of time traveling within time and space. It was more a matter of going underneath time and space and into the underlying deep structure that informs our experience.

Emmy Vadnais:
I recall in your book that you were shown the universe goes on and on, essentially. Is that right?

> sing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.
Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?

Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.

Chris Bache:
…shared in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—infused with mind and soul. And, of course, now we know how vast the physical universe is, and the question becomes: how large is the mind of the universe? How deep is it?

I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.

> Chris a chance to connect the living universe with the evolution of life through that living system.
Chris Bache
In that context, let me say something hard and consoling at the same time. From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.

> responsible for the way we contract, largely for protection and fear. Is that a fair representation?
Chris Bache
It is, and that description fits better in the early stages, when you’re working at insights that help you understand your individual way of being in the world. I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown. The universe can only communicate to you what you have the capacity to understand.

> en the universe at large—the physical universe—and us as agents at the leading edge of this process?
Chris Bache:
You’re asking good questions. Let me step back and put this in context. All the religions of the last 5,000 years—the Axial Age—came into existence when we first began to get beneath individual consciousness and tap into spiritual consciousness, the consciousness of the universe or the Divine. The religions of this era, both Western and Eastern, are examples of what I would call an up-and-out cosmology. I understand their intention: when you experientially touch your divine essence, it is so ecstatic and blissful—so much more satisfying than physical existence—that how could you not think you belong there more than here? So the theologies born in this period are theologies of return. They basically say we don’t belong on Earth; we belong in heaven. Somehow, through misfortune or punishment, we’re here, but what we should do is get out of here and go back there—whether through Western concepts of salvation or Eastern concepts of reincarnation leading to moksha, escape back to spiritual paradise.

> McNay:
It started with the questions, but the adventure led you far beyond those initial questions.
Chris Bache:
And then beyond even collective transformation—it became an adventure in knowing the universe, an adventure in being drawn deep into intimacy with the creative intelligence, into causal reality, into oneness, into śūnyatā, emptiness, the fertile void, into the sat-chit-ananda—existence before existence. One adventure after another, deeper and deeper. I have an acute sense that the universe loves to be known—the universe wants to be known. We are part of its knowing. When we return to source, when we begin that journey back to point of origin, we are met by a massive supreme intelligence, extraordinary compassion and loving beyond imagination. And it is so happy that part of itself has come back to experience and know it. It wants to show you creation, show you what has been going on. The universe has been working for billions of years, and we are just now—over the last few thousand years—beginning to open deeply enough to consciously participate and see the creative process. It’s so happy when we do that.

Chris Bache:
No.

Jef Baker:
Did you have a teacher during all of this?
Chris Bache: No, I consider the universe my only teacher. One unusual feature of my experiences, compared to others I've spoken with, is that I didn’t have much contact with individual beings, which are so common in the DMT experience. Over time I pondered why. I kept being dissolved into levels of being, then dissolved into deeper levels, opening into vast expanses of consciousness and learning how the universe works—not by engaging discrete beings who live on those levels. The closest I came to “beings,” as such, was in archetypal reality, but those realities were so large that the best my mind could do was image them as galaxies—billions of light-years across. They were profoundly foreign.

As we really wrap up, any final thoughts or questions you felt should have been directed your way?
Chris Bache:
You mentioned The Living Classroom at the beginning, and it’s too late to go into it at length. But the core truth manifesting there—without mentioning psychedelics—is that consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do in our individual field radiates 360 degrees. All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us. That’s the core teaching of The Living Classroom: there’s an atomistic quality to teaching, and a quantum quality. You and I have been having, in some ways, an atomistic conversation, but we can trust that there’s a quantum quality to it.

> dge into a world that seems to be falling apart on every level, how do you cope with that dichotomy?
Chris Bache: It’s challenging, but there are mitigating dynamics. The deeper your experience of the intelligence of life and the joy of its creative manifestation, the more you see the universe for what it is—the body of the Divine, the body of God. The universe manifests a profound intelligence. Once you touch that, you’re overwhelmed by its brilliance, wisdom, and love—an order of love beyond anything I’d known in this lifetime.

Those experiences change how you see everything. And they give you a larger horizon to understand the human experience. I adopted reincarnation early on based on empirical evidence—reading Ian Stevenson and early past-life therapy work—but it still takes years to truly live into a universe that pulses in reincarnation cycles, not just for individuals but for the species.

> stantiation of the universe—every life, the ones that suffer and the ones that don't suffer as much.
Chris Bache
And I address this in Lifecycles: human suffering brings us to our knees, and I don’t think we have an adequate understanding or explanation of it. In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.

Yes. Think of a mother universe and a daughter universe. The mother universe is spiritual reality, continually infusing, orchestrating, shaping, and receiving physical reality. At the subatomic level there’s a dance, a continual infusion of energy into time and space from the quantum or sub-quantum realm. Ninety-six percent of the universe is dark energy and dark matter—physical existence is just the surface.

> sharing of its being, which I’m sure is an inadequate model by itself, but I’ve asked the universe—
Jef Baker: I’m thinking of the simile of the universe as a diamond with infinite facets, each face being an individual human showing a piece of light that is part of the whole.

Chris Bache: And we always have to remind ourselves that what has emerged up to this point is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s just getting started. We have to imagine ourselves a million years from now—which is nothing in evolutionary time—envisioning the answer to this question: What is the purpose of creation? Why is this happening? A million years from now, we’ll have a much deeper answer to that question, and a million years after that, deeper still. So I caution closure on these questions. I’d rather be agnostic, open-ended. I do think it has to do with self-knowledge and self-expression. I think it has to do with sharing nature—opening opportunities for life to breed life, life to grow life.

> reincarnating beings in a universe that supports, nurtures, and created this reincarnation dynamic.
Richard Rudd
That’s a huge difference, isn’t it—living in a universe that nurtures us, with a kind of paternal-maternal energy surrounding it. That’s such a different framework to be born into.

Chris Bache
Yes. And I want to mention at the outset that some reincarnation thinkers assume every little thing in our lives is determined, but I don’t think we need to go there. Chance is a powerful element of this universe. We can affirm meaning and intentionality without forcing every detail into that press of “What’s the meaning of this? What’s the meaning of that?” We can affirm a larger scope of meaning in a world with chance, variables, and uncertainties. What’s important is understanding that the universe pays attention to how we respond to chance events as well as intentional events. Our learning—our quality of response—is carried forward and does us credit, regardless of the origin of the challenges we face.

> an ever-unfolding deepening of rapport between the creative intelligence and we who are its result.
Roger Walsh
Yes. I’m going to ask a question that would take several more sessions, but it has to be asked. After all these experiences—openings and gifts that dramatically impacted your sense of self, your purpose, and the nature of reality, exploding your understanding multiple times—how would you describe, to the extent you can, your understanding of the nature of reality now? How would you characterize your worldview?

Chris Bache
I’ll do my best to answer and not weep as I do so.

John Dupuy
Go ahead and weep if you need to.

Chris Bache
I see the universe as pure genius—saturated with genius and the creative impulse. The birth of stars, galaxies, planets, species, the emergence of self-aware species, and a reincarnating species on this planet are acts of profound genius and love—the sharing of existence, the gestation of conditions that make infinite progression possible.

> experiencing is part of that. For what point—what is the ultimate purpose of all of this happening?
Chris Bache:
Let me break that down into two parts—the classical vision, first, on reincarnation. In most Eastern traditions, you grow, get clearer, kinder, more generous, cultivate deeper qualities, and eventually reach a spiritual maturing where your consciousness opens to the core of your being. You awaken to the fact that the essence of your nature is the essence of all nature, that all beings share the same nature. There’s an explosion of compassion and a deep embrace of the universe. The usual interpretation is that you are now free to leave time and space—what the Hindus call Moksha—to escape Samsara. It’s an “up and out” cosmology. The religions of the Axial Age, in one way or another, are part of that pattern: we don’t want to be on Earth, we’re in a veil of tears, we want out—by salvation or enlightenment. But that leaves fundamentally unexplained: What is the purpose of the universe? What is the purpose of this magnificent creation? With our deeper understanding of the magnitude of existence—how many billions of years went into the unfolding of the universe—it becomes profoundly unacceptable and short-sighted to think the purpose of life is to awaken to your true nature and then escape into nirvana or an off-planet paradise.

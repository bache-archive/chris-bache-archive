> Christopher M. Bache is a scholar and practitioner known for his exploration of the intersections between consciousness, spirituality, and psychedelic experiences. His work often incorporates elements of Vajrayana Buddhism, particularly the Chöd practice, which aims to cut through ego and remove obstacles on the spiritual path. Bache's insights contribute to a broader understanding of how various spiritual practices can inform and enhance experiences of altered states of consciousness.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶5**

> This change was so palpable that immediately after the session I decided to learn Chöd myself. Two months later, I received the practice from Lama Tsultrim, and it became a regular part of my spiritual practice. Since that day, I have never done a psychedelic session without doing Chöd first.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶2**

> On the morning of my first entry into the Diamond Luminosity, Carol offered to do a Tibetan practice for me that she had recently learned called Chöd. Chöd means “cutting.” It is a Vajrayana Buddhist practice for removing obstacles and cutting through ego. Its lineage traces back to Machig Labdrön, a revered female practitioner from eleventh-century Tibet. Carol had received the practice from her teacher, Lama Tsultrim Allione, who had received it from her teacher, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. I quickly accepted her invitation because it felt timely. The previous session had finished well, and today felt like it would be a good day. So on this particular morning, we started the day with Carol doing Chöd over me for forty minutes, and then we began the session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §5 ¶16**

> After many cycles of cleansing and struggle, my teacher, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, suddenly appeared. I saw his face and felt his presence strongly. Then without anything being said, he introduced me to the Nature of Mind. Instantly and without transition of any kind, my mind opened into pure, boundless clarity. Absolutely without content, it was both the context and the content of all thoughts and sensations.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶12**

> Purification is one of those “pay me now or pay me later” things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §2 ¶2**

> I stopped my sessions, first, because I was experiencing a chronic pain in my subtle energy system. There was so much energy moving through me in the weeks and months following each session that I was always uncomfortable. The Vajrayana practices had helped, but even they could not keep up with the increased flow of energy entering me in these last years. Despite all the precautions I had taken, despite all the yoga and meditation, and despite the purifications that had taken place inside the sessions themselves, this problem wasn’t going away. It was getting worse.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶57**

> back and forth between the pain and transpersonal horizons several times before finally settling into a clear, spacious state. As I did, an interactive arena of dialogue with a Council of Elders opened around me. The music was the deep guttural chanting of the Tibetan monks of the Gyuto monastery. The head monk's powerful bass voice grabbed me and held me fast, completely stopping my thought process. A voice said, “Stop everything and pay attention! Pay attention and learn!” Class had resumed.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §0 ¶17**

> Buddhism teaches that there are no separate things in existence, that all conditioned reality is characterized by *śūnyatā*, “emptiness” or “transparency.” As the Dalai Lama explains in *The Universe in a Single Atom*, “Things and events are ‘empty’ in that they can never possess any immutable essence, intrinsic reality or absolute ‘being’ that affords independence” (2005). Nothing holds its existence by itself but is always transparent to the underlying matrix of cause and effect. When one experiences emptiness, one experiences the complete absence of an independent self, not only in one’s own person but in all reality. In this session, I experienced emptiness and Oneness as two sides of the same coin. When we experience the universe as One, it is clear that independent, separate things do not exist. Conversely, when the separate self dissolves completely, the Oneness of life spontaneously rises in our awareness.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §5 ¶3**

> The sessions are getting harder to describe not because of their exotic qualities but because of their very mundaneness. In striking contrast to my earlier sessions, the frame of reference for my present experience is my immediate life. My personal life is being turned inside out and refashioned. Pieces of my past are being systematically brought forward and emptied, like taking bottles down from a shelf and pouring them out. Now, however, when each bottle is drained, I do not dissolve into the otherworldly diamond radiance of dharmakaya but into the mundane world of my historical existence rendered transparent in sunyata [emptiness]. The ecstasy of transcending space-time appears to be yielding to the transparency of embodied Presence inside space-time. Where is this process leading? (Session 65)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §1 ¶15**

> There is a space that is always open in the middle of every moment, every action. Here it was. Unmistakable. Complete freedom in the midst of action. How does one move into it? There is a posture of inner attention that brings freedom and bliss. In which the world moves effortlessly as One. If dropped for an instant, the world falls into its familiar pieces and samsara resumes. A taste. Another lesson to use in daily training.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §1 ¶2**

> I started the session with a memory of the Diamond Light of Pure Clarity. I felt how true it is that spending seconds in that pristine
>  state undoes countless centuries of wandering lost in samsara. It felt as though all my psychedelic sessions had been one long Ngondro
>  preparing me for entry into this reality. I recalled the many rigidities and fixations in me that had been broken down on this journey and
>  knew that there was no shortcutting the lengthy purification required for awakening.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §3 ¶1**

> I entered the last two sessions of this series knowing that I was about to stop my work for an unknown period of time. In the sixteenth session, something unexpected happened. When everything disintegrated into its chaotic flow, the pain escalated into a frenzy so extreme that it morphed into an orgy of *bhaktian* rapture. Just as the suffering reached a fevered pitch, the thought of the Divine flashed in my mind and I surrendered completely. Caught in surging elemental forces, I became a devotee singing to the Divine in ecstatic trance. He was vast, and he played me like a trumpet. My consciousness was the instrument and my life the melody.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §0 ¶23**

> Light manifesting as Matter,
> Dharmakaya manifesting as Nirmanakaya,

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §1 ¶4**

> I went through many cycles of pain and resolution and then became caught in an acoustic ritual that was restructuring me at the core. The Tibetan chanting in the music blended seamlessly with scenes of primal Africa. I saw visions of a circle of elders surrounded by a large gathering of African dancers moving in rhythmic cadence. I was inside the circle, sometimes alone and sometimes with other initiates. The chanting was a kind of shamanic initiation, a ritual of purification and transformation. There was a violent quality to what was happening, as though I had volunteered for something that had gotten out of control. Nevertheless, I felt safe in the hands of these ancient ones even as they broke me down.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶25**

> Some of my students also started having unusually deep experiences of some of the concepts I was presenting in class. As I was simply going about my work describing the perennial truths of the world’s religions, some students began to have powerful spiritual openings around these truths, such as impermanence, interdependence, oneness, no-self, and the divine within. Insights long dormant in their unconscious suddenly sprang to life. Symptoms of chakra opening and kundalini arousal began to manifest in the room. Students felt their energy spontaneously shifting to higher centers of awareness, though they often did not have the vocabulary to describe it this way. It was as though they were being activated by more than just the verbal presentation of ideas, as though they were being touched by the actual *experience* of these realities that now lived in me to some degree because of my psychedelic practice.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶11**

> The Diamond Light that exploded from my chest in session 38 was the forerunner of what emerged in full splendor now. After going through yet one more intense cycle of death and rebirth, I was taken into a brilliantly clear, supremely luminous radiance. Buddhism calls this radiance *dharmakaya*—the Clear Light of Absolute Reality. I call it the domain of Diamond Luminosity. This Luminosity captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest in continuing to explore the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me. This was a different order of reality altogether. Its clarity was so overwhelming, its energy so pure that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions.

> This eruption of *bhaktian* devotion caught me by surprise because it was completely different from my usual approach to spirituality, which has always been more mental in character. Of the four spiritual paths in Hinduism—*jnana* (knowledge), *karma* (service), *raja* (meditation), and *bhakti* (devotion)—*bhakti* is the path I have least identified with, and yet here it was.

> This change was so palpable that immediately after the session I decided to learn Chöd myself. Two months later, I received the practice from Lama Tsultrim, and it became a regular part of my spiritual practice. Since that day, I have never done a psychedelic session without doing Chöd first.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶7 (1 · 8)**

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶13 (10 · 3)**

> I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics and the reservations some teachers have about them as agents of spiritual transformation. And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)**

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)**

> If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)**

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶12 (2 · 2)**

> Purification is one of those “pay me now or pay me later” things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)**

> LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §8 ¶1 (7 · 8)**

> One of the great challenges of entering intense psychedelic states of consciousness is learning how to learn from experiences that are breaking all the rules as they redefine the possible. In these states, our deepest instincts are often overturned and reversed. One learns to yield to, even welcome the offensive rather than pull back from it. Painful experiences can become something you seek out rather than avoid. The utterly bizarre can become the familiar so many times that you cannot anticipate what shape the next twist of learning will take. You may find yourself stuck in some endless repetitive maze where it is not clear what is happening, what you are doing to perpetuate this stalemate, or what you might do (or stop doing) to shift the situation. It may not even be clear whether this is a situation you can influence or whether it is something you simply must endure, as the following excerpt illustrates.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶6 (1 · 12)**

> In deep psychedelic work, *one learns by becoming*. This is especially true when working with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. We cannot transport the egoic self into these depths where it can then “have an experience” of how the world works there. In order to know the universe at these levels, we must *become* a citizen of these levels. We must *become* the levels themselves. To do this, our smaller sense of self must cease to be the container of our experience. It must die. Giving up everything is simply the price of inheriting everything else.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)**

> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶14 (10 · 0)**

> This chapter tells the story of what happened in these four sessions. It is the story of entering the Diamond Light and of the intense purification that took place as this Diamond Light began to work its way more deeply into my physical being. The first two of these sessions focused on entering the Diamond Luminosity at successively deeper levels, the second two on absorbing the Diamond Luminosity into my mind and body. Into this narrative, I will weave two other pieces. The first is a set of new insights into the psychedelic process that emerged at this time. The second is the story of how I came to integrate Vajrayana Buddhist practice into my psychedelic practice and why.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶11 (1 · 12)**

> But there is also a second variable at work here, and that is the speed with which we tear these skins away, how impatient we are to know the universe at these depths. If we choose a form of transformational practice in which our conditioning is released slowly, the result is a series of smaller initiations spread over a longer period of time, perhaps even many lifetimes. By contrast, working with a psychedelic like LSD is an example of a transformational practice that triggers an accelerated purification process that gives us quicker access to these realities, but there is a price to be paid for this quicker access. The price is the intensification of the death-rebirth process.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶2 (1 · 5)**

> The choice to work with high doses turned out to have enormous consequences for what unfolded on this journey. It radically expanded not only the *depth of consciousness* reached but also the *breadth of consciousness* being activated in each session. It wasn’t simply a matter of eating the same karmic meal in fewer bites, as I had naively thought. Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web. Working at these levels changed not only how deep my experiences went but also who or what was actually having these experiences, what the “working unit” of experience was in a session. In these highly energized conditions, the size of the patient literally expands. What I mean by this will become clearer as we proceed.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶22 (1)**

> Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a *cosmic communion* to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶14 (1 · 4)**

> At the same time, I think that there is a legitimate role for working judiciously with high doses of LSD in carefully managed sessions conducted in a safe and protected environment. It’s certainly true that high doses tend to overwhelm one’s psychological defenses and shatter one’s egoic identity, but whether this leads to dissociation and dysphoria depends to a great extent on how one engages one’s sessions. The dismantling of one’s psychological boundaries is a frightening, gutwrenching experience both physically and psychologically, but *if you are prepared for this unraveling and meet it head-on*, it can be both manageable and beneficial.

Chris ended his psychedelic explorations in 1999, and it wasn't until 2009 he wrote his first book, The Living Classroom. Here he shared how his expansive consciousness seemed to impact his students in what he called leaky boundaries. Again, those of us in integral recognize the psychoactive effect presencing has upon others.

> Fogleman:
What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?
Chris Bache:
It was my first wife, Carol—my sitter in my sessions and a clinical psychologist—who really brought me into Vajrayana. I was more interested in the Zen tradition. I wasn’t interested in all the bells, candles, incense, and fanfare that comes with Vajrayana. But she went there, and I followed her. Through her, I met teachers gathering at the Tara Mandala Buddhist retreat center—Lama sutra malayonis established the center in Colorado—and I began to study there and go into retreats with that lineage. I met their lineage of awakened beings, and they made a deep impression on me. If my karma had introduced me to the great awakened beings of the Zen lineage, I could have gone there just as easily. It was the opportunity to meet these beings and receive teachings that made a large impression.

Tasshin Fogleman:
Coming back to your explorations, you use the phrase “deep time.” Can you say what you mean by that?

> art, but to continue evolving. Do you feel your journey confirms Buddhism, and where does it differ?
Chris Bache
I’ve been deeply influenced by all the world’s religions. I began as a Christian and a Catholic—four years in seminary studying for the priesthood. I studied Hebrew and Greek for biblical work. I’ve learned so much from Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Native traditions. The two deepest, longest-lasting influences on me have been Christianity and Buddhism.

I think my journey affirms the deepest truths of Christianity and of all the world’s religions—Judaism’s Kabbalah, Hinduism, Buddhism—while also, in important ways, eclipsing the religions of the last several thousand years. The universe I was initiated into demanded levels of understanding beyond anything I had learned in those traditions. I had to become operational within a deeper metaphysics.

Chris Bache:
…shared in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—infused with mind and soul. And, of course, now we know how vast the physical universe is, and the question becomes: how large is the mind of the universe? How deep is it?

I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.

> I love that description. What was it that so captured you about Grof’s work when you encountered it?
Chris Bache:
I immediately saw that if what he was saying was correct, it had enormous implications—for philosophy, which was my interest—not just for healing in clinical psychology. Here was a method that allowed deep, firsthand access to dimensions of consciousness and, through those dimensions, to dimensions of reality I had seen described in many spiritual literatures. This was a protocol that allowed people to be initiated, if only temporarily—what I call the path of temporary immersion. We have to be careful not to confuse a path of temporary immersion with what I would call the path of abiding presence, the more contemplative, meditational path. But this gave temporary access to states far beyond ordinary egoic awareness and far beyond space-time, to explore the deep structure of the universe itself.

> see if I got it right. Welcome to the people who are live and those who are going to join us later.
Chris Bache—the story I know is that he is now a retired professor of religious studies and philosophy from Ohio State University and Youngstown, Ohio. Early in his career he was always interested in mysticism and deep spiritual exploration, and he came upon the work of the legendary psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, who pioneered a protocol for working with high doses of LSD in particular. Chris undertook what turned out to be a 20-year journey of 73 high-dose LSD sessions following the Stan Grof protocol—sessions using 500 to 600 micrograms of LSD, which, for any of you not familiar with that calculation, is a high dose. The protocol involves working at home or in a safe, quiet space with headphones and a carefully curated playlist, eyeshades to block out the light so inner visions aren’t obstructed, and a qualified sitter. In Chris’s case, the sitter was a therapist who knew what she was doing. Generally, he did this on a Saturday, and the following day—again following the Grof protocol—he spent basically the whole day with the headphones on to trigger memories of what was playing when certain experiences and visions occurred, and then meticulously transcribed all that.

> blows your psyche completely apart, layer by layer, until eventually you dissolve into the universe.
On Saturday morning you’re in time-space; then you blow yourself apart and dissolve. You’re not functioning as “Chris Bache having an experience.” You dissolve as Chris Bache into some stratum of existence, some field of reality. You become that reality. If you do it well, you have continuity of memory in and out, but you don’t have continuity of identity. Dissolved into these fields of consciousness, you can do things my “Chris Bache” could never do and learn things he could never learn within ordinary time-space reality. You get blown into these realities, live there for a few hours, and then the second miracle happens: you come back and re-integrate your time-space identity.

I seem to have a psychological makeup that makes both rhythms—dissolving and re-congealing—easier for me. The letting go into, and the coming back to a single human being, are both important.

Lauren Taus:
So profound. Given that you don’t recommend that, what would you advise for someone seeking to access some of these experiences?

> sing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.
Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?

Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.

Simeon Mihaylov
So you began with the motivation to explore the universe as a philosopher?
Chris Bache
Correct. I’m not a therapist—though I received much healing in this work and am grateful for it. My primary intention, as a philosopher of religion, was to explore the universe as deeply as I could and understand not only my nature but the larger landscape.

Simeon Mihaylov
You’ve said your experiences fit within the larger body of religious and philosophical traditions, which gave you confidence in their genuineness, yet they also pushed boundaries and took you into areas you hadn’t encountered elsewhere. Do psychedelics, then, offer the promise of genuinely new philosophical and spiritual insights? How do you see them fitting into the future development of philosophy and spirituality for our species?

Chris Bache
This is an exciting time and territory. I became convinced early on that psychedelics represent a true before-and-after moment in philosophical reflection. Philosophy, in one way or another, reflects on the breadth of human experience—our own and others’. Here we have an opportunity to temporarily deepen and widen awareness, pushing its boundaries.

> ’re a professor of theology and philosophy. What made you go on this journey starting way back when?
Chris Bache:
At first, I think it was a foolish strategy to push it as hard as I did, but I didn’t know any better at the time—or I was young and stupid. I was trained as a philosopher of religion with a passionate desire to understand the deep structure of the universe. I had studied some of the great minds in our Western and Eastern traditions. When I found the methodology that Stan made available, I decided to push it as long and as hard as I could. There was a great deal of suffering, episodically and periodically. But at the end of every episode of intense suffering, there would be a breakthrough into a phase of deep, ecstatic bliss and deep transpersonal encounter. The value of those insights and that ecstasy more than balanced out the transient episodes of suffering.

Marc Caron:
A quick note from the chat: Melanie White says, “Thank you, Chris. I loved the book LSD and the Mind of the Universe, and thank you for sharing your insights tonight.” For those watching online, we’ll take questions from our Zoom audience. Here’s one: how does your process relate to Christology? Did you have Christ avatar experiences, and how does that map onto your journey?

Chris Bache:
Interesting question. Two traditions have had the largest influence on my life—Christianity and Buddhism. I also taught world religions for decades, and the lineages became passionate lovers for me; each taught me so much. While I started within a Christian framework, I came to see that Christ is the fruition of a spiritual impulse in the Middle East that parallels, in seminal ways, the fruition of similar impulses in India, Africa, South America. Larger patterns emerged.

Abstract

Chris Bache describes meeting a guiding intelligence in deep psychedelic practice as an encounter with an

infinite, formless consciousness. Rather than appearing as a deity or personified figure, this presence is

felt as a vast, adaptive intelligence whose qualities shift as one’s own mind is purified and integrated

over many sessions. Bache frames the individual mind as a “seed crystal” that catalyzes specific facets of

experience from the limitless potential of universal consciousness. As practice deepens, the intersection of

individual and universal mind changes, eliciting more profound guidance. Pushing beyond the collective psyche

and Jungian archetypes, he says religious images and concepts fall away, revealing states that outstrip

categories like gods, angels, or cultural frameworks. The guidance remains constant, but its expression is

> never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.
Working at very high energetic levels sometimes set in motion processes difficult to integrate in my subtle energy system. If you know Alex Grey’s depictions of powerful energies triggered in deep psychedelic work, you’ll recognize how, after a session, your system can feel achy and stretched. Vajrayana practices—Guru Yoga or deity yoga—gave that energy a place to run when I was back in ordinary consciousness and body. So for clarifying cognitive content, practicing teachings given in sessions, and managing the energetic consequences, a daily spiritual practice is really important.

> s clarification in the consciousness of people to whom they have karmic connection. Simple, natural.
So I asked: what would it be like to teach consciously in a transpersonal or integral pedagogy—one that recognizes the innate interconnectivity of consciousness? Not abandoning individual strategies that work, but incorporating focused intentionality and conscious engagement that goes beyond classical teaching. For example, ChÃ¶d is a Vajrayana purification practice. I learned ChÃ¶d for my own spiritual work. Before a class began, when I received the roster, I started incorporating those students into my ChÃ¶d practice. I would literally pray for them throughout the course—for their well-being. Not presuming I know what’s right for them, just praying for their well-being.

> essions I was given many practices—told, “Do this, do that”—and I took those into my daily practice.
In the last five years of my work, as I discuss in the Diamond Luminosity chapter, I entered Vajrayana Buddhism. I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.

> ferently, where causal-level reality is a different physics, a different landscape of consciousness.
When you open to these depths and then return to ordinary consciousness, it’s really important to have a daily practice to anchor you, to keep your feet on the ground. The skills cultivated in Vipassana or zazen—observation and non-attachment—are precisely the skills you use in a psychedelic session, so they reinforce each other. Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.

In the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a ChÃ¶d practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions. I immediately learned that practice and began doing it before any session. I would never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.

> vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.
I also have a sense—because I’ve “died” so many times and gone where I will go when I die physically—that I feel very comfortable with that domain. We’re told over and over that we practice to prepare for the moment of death because it has great potential for accelerating our evolution. I agree. My psychedelic practice has been done in a way to prepare me for the moment of death. The result is that I feel comfortable with death and with navigating what comes after, because I feel I’ve already encountered it in many ways.

Tasshin Fogleman:
What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?

> developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.
For example, in classic Vajrayana we distinguish between the Samaya Safa and the Jnana sattva. The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa. The living memory of the diamond luminosity is, for me, a more effective spiritual vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.

> meditation and Vajrayana in augmenting, supporting, enhancing, stabilizing what you’ve gone through?
Chris Bache
One gift of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation for the power and effectiveness of classic contemplative practices, including Vajrayana. By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.

> u’ve used Dharmakaya. Are there other Tibetan or Buddhist terms that relate to what you experienced?
Chris Bache:
Yes. Clear light mind, to me, is closer to the nature of mind in this context. I’m still digesting the differences between Diamond Luminosity as an extra-samsaric reality and Diamond Luminosity as the foundation of nirmanakaya existence. There are many correlations, and all honor to the great beings who have explored these dimensions more deeply than I’ve been able to—always a humble student of the great teachers. I put names as best I can to clarify, but it’s tricky—naming can shrink-wrap and stop the mystery, letting the mind back in where it doesn’t belong. So let me step into a little different framework.

> ve transformation. I think there are more bodhisattvas on this planet than we might initially think.
Chris Bache:
In my experience, working at high doses, every session breaks down into two phases: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. There’s the dark, hard, death-and-dying kind of phase, and then the ecstatic phase. In reference to this work, James’ excellent talk this morning about shadow work was on point. Working as I did in a non-therapeutic modality, one of the great gifts I learned from Stan Grof is to completely, absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far as it wants to take you.

> sitely clear, beyond imagination. Buddhism calls it Dharmakaya, the absolute reality of clear light.
Over five years and 26 sessions, I was taken into this reality only four times. In between, there was tremendous purification. In these states, you dissolve into light, take on the qualities and boundlessness of light—you dissolve in the crystalline nature of the Divine. I don’t mean divine in any conventional or theistic sense, but I have no other vocabulary for it. In each of those four adventures going deeper, the divine began to come deeper into my body. I was handled carefully and broken down, and then this consciousness brought me to the end of my work, gave me an overview of all my sessions, showed me the whole pattern, and gave me my final instructions. I didn’t know it was over until it called it. I knew then I had to stop.

> ventually there was no going and coming—just a session-long abiding in this transcendent luminosity.
You could call it ecstasy, and it was, but different from earlier ecstasies. Its most striking characteristic was clarity—clarity, clarity, clarity. It was the context within which all thinking and feeling took place; in itself it was hyper-clear, breathtakingly clear. I understood the teachings that even touching something like this for one second dissolves thousands of years of wandering in the shadows of samsara. I came to understand it as extra-samsaric reality, and a particularly intense version of it. At first I thought of it in terms of sambhagaya because of the extreme bliss, but as I went back to the sources and studied more carefully, I associated it with Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality.

> rough cycles of death and rebirth, their significance, and how they facilitate collective awakening.
Chris Bache:
First, what I’m going to describe is my variation on an ancient Buddhist teaching. When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.

> ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?
Chris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.

> lly the Diamond Luminosity sessions—immersions into Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.
But in the five or six years after stopping, I entered what I call the deep sadness—a withdrawal into loneliness from not being able to return to ecstatic experiences of being dissolved into light. I knew I needed to stop; I had to spend years absorbing what I had. But there was such an unfulfilled longing to return that I reached a point where I realized I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children and my students. I wasn’t suicidal; I was living a balanced life. But in my heart, I was waiting to die. Eventually I realized something’s wrong. This is not how this work is supposed to end. I must have made a mistake. I even wondered, Is it possible to have too much God? But I knew the entire physical universe is God; the Divine is everything that exists. So it wasn’t too much God—it was too much transcendence.

> ou shared through my lens of a non-psychedelic but cutting-edge spiritual and developmental journey.
Chris Bache:
Absolutely. This is a variation of a universal pattern: if you want to open to deeper truths and a deeper participatory relationship with the universe, you have to empty yourself of everything keeping you small—old ways of thinking and feeling—and those patterns have biological correlates. You go through detoxification—physical as well as mental and emotional. In Tibetan Buddhism, before receiving higher teachings capable of generating awakening, one must first do what’s called NDR, the preparatory practices—five practices you do 100,000 times each. One is full-body prostrations while reciting mantras. You’re going to the ground, lying down, getting up, praying—retuning your mind with mantras, your heart with devotion, and working your body to purify it while purifying mind and heart. That’s how it is for all spiritual practice. If psychedelics push you quickly into a higher state, you then have to purify after you’ve been in that state.

> and reality. It was too compelling to pass up, so I made the choice to break the law and go for it.
I always had a sitter—my first wife, Carol, a clinical psychologist. She wasn’t fond of what I was doing, but she knew I was committed and agreed to help so I could do it safely. She didn’t take notes; we set up a video camera once, but it’s basically boring to watch—just someone lying down. It’s all internal. I’m not in touch with Carol except through the music in the room and, occasionally, a word or two. I’m so far outside time-space that I barely relate to what’s happening around me, but she was always there taking care of me.

Was she influenced by my sessions? Yes and no. Carol never did psychedelics. She’s a serious Vajrayana practitioner—she completed a three-year retreat with her vajra teacher—and has deep commitments to her lineage. I learned a lot from her. It felt more like a side-by-side play.

Tom Habib: I really appreciated your emphasis on “coming off the mountain”—bringing the ineffable into life here and now. On a specific note: why the word “diamond” for those realms?

> sociated with the concept of Dharmakaya—the fundamental reality that is the source of all existence.
Let me back up: light entered my experiences in many forms and levels—many gradations. I'd experienced light many times in earlier death-rebirth processes. When I talk about the diamond light, it isn't just a metaphor: I'm describing an exceptionally clear and intense awareness, a crystalline light that eventually becomes transparent to itself. In those last five years—the last 26 sessions, about a third of all my work—I entered that reality four times, about once a year. Each time involved more detoxification, and about a year later, I'd re-enter that reality. That’s the kind of larger overview.

> love—the sharing of existence, the gestation of conditions that make infinite progression possible.
I see death and rebirth, reincarnation, the bardo—a graded series of levels that reflect our limits and capacities after death. I used to think of the bardo as an opposition, a cloud getting in the way. Now I see it as a compassionate blanket that keeps us safe as we enter deeper communion with the true power. Call it the divine, though our concepts of God are childish compared to the reality. To touch that power before we are fully formed and strong enough would shatter us. We have to be very congealed as individuals to touch that reality and stay conscious and coherent within it. And that’s just the level outside the bardo of this piece of time and space. I don’t know what lies beyond the Dharmakaya or the absolute dimension.

After the benediction of blessings, I felt completely fulfilled. The universe had asked something of me, and in offering it up, I was rewarded with more joy than I could have ever imagined—a philosopher’s dream come true. I had known God, the fertile void, and profound joy. Little did I know I still had five years to go in this journey. After one more cycle of death and rebirth, I entered an extraordinarily clear state of consciousness—which I came to call diamond luminosity. This is what Buddhists refer to as Dharmakaya, the absolute clear light of being. Though I had encountered light in many subtle dimensions before, diamond light is of a different order entirely—ultra-clear, super-luminous, beyond imagination.

> to the primal void, the Buddha womb, Satchitananda, the fertile void beneath all manifest existence.
Another session, which I titled "Jesus' Blood," was an overwhelming experience of cosmic love. It's being drenched in a love so deep you realize you've never truly been loved until you've been loved like God loves—a force far deeper than anything I had encountered before. Another pivotal experience was the "birth of the diamond soul." Eleven years prior, I had an experience of my life as a completed whole, from start to finish, but in my fortieth session, I began to sense the integration of all my former lives. It was as if all my previous incarnations were winding together, like a string of white light around a kite spool. When this collective memory hit a critical mass, it exploded, fusing all those individual lives into one, and my consciousness soared beyond any sense of individual existence. I experienced what I call diamond luminosity—my heart ruptured, and my awareness expanded dramatically. This was my first taste of the state where I believe reincarnation is taking us.

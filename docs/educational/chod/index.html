<blockquote>
<p>Christopher M. Bache is a scholar whose work explores the intersections of consciousness, spirituality, and transformative practices, particularly within the context of Vajrayana Buddhism. His research often incorporates personal experiences with psychedelic states and their integration through traditional practices such as Chöd. Bache's contributions provide insights into the dynamics of energy, awareness, and the processes of purification and realization in both spiritual and psychological frameworks.</p>

<p>This change was so palpable that immediately after the session I decided to learn Chöd myself. Two months later, I received the practice from Lama Tsultrim, and it became a regular part of my spiritual practice. Since that day, I have never done a psychedelic session without doing Chöd first.</p>

<p>On the morning of my first entry into the Diamond Luminosity, Carol offered to do a Tibetan practice for me that she had recently learned called Chöd. Chöd means “cutting.” It is a Vajrayana Buddhist practice for removing obstacles and cutting through ego. Its lineage traces back to Machig Labdrön, a revered female practitioner from eleventh-century Tibet. Carol had received the practice from her teacher, Lama Tsultrim Allione, who had received it from her teacher, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. I quickly accepted her invitation because it felt timely. The previous session had finished well, and today felt like it would be a good day. So on this particular morning, we started the day with Carol doing Chöd over me for forty minutes, and then we began the session.</p>

<p>After many cycles of cleansing and struggle, my teacher, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, suddenly appeared. I saw his face and felt his presence strongly. Then without anything being said, he introduced me to the Nature of Mind. Instantly and without transition of any kind, my mind opened into pure, boundless clarity. Absolutely without content, it was both the context and the content of all thoughts and sensations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Purification is one of those “pay me now or pay me later” things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.</p>

<p>I stopped my sessions, first, because I was experiencing a chronic pain in my subtle energy system. There was so much energy moving through me in the weeks and months following each session that I was always uncomfortable. The Vajrayana practices had helped, but even they could not keep up with the increased flow of energy entering me in these last years. Despite all the precautions I had taken, despite all the yoga and meditation, and despite the purifications that had taken place inside the sessions themselves, this problem wasn’t going away. It was getting worse.</p>

As I did, an interactive arena of dialogue with a Council of Elders opened around me. The music was the deep guttural chanting of the Tibetan monks of the Gyuto monastery. The head monk's powerful bass voice grabbed me and held me fast, completely stopping my thought process. A voice said, “Stop everything and pay attention! Pay attention and learn!” Class had resumed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Buddhism teaches that there are no separate things in existence, that all conditioned reality is characterized by <em>śūnyatā</em>, “emptiness” or “transparency.” As the Dalai Lama explains in <em>The Universe in a Single Atom</em>, “Things and events are ‘empty’ in that they can never possess any immutable essence, intrinsic reality or absolute ‘being’ that affords independence” (2005). Nothing holds its existence by itself but is always transparent to the underlying matrix of cause and effect. When one experiences emptiness, one experiences the complete absence of an independent self, not only in one’s own person but in all reality. In this session, I experienced emptiness and Oneness as two sides of the same coin. When we experience the universe as One, it is clear that independent, separate things do not exist. Conversely, when the separate self dissolves completely, the Oneness of life spontaneously rises in our awareness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sessions are getting harder to describe not because of their exotic qualities but because of their very mundaneness. In striking contrast to my earlier sessions, the frame of reference for my present experience is my immediate life. My personal life is being turned inside out and refashioned. Pieces of my past are being systematically brought forward and emptied, like taking bottles down from a shelf and pouring them out. Now, however, when each bottle is drained, I do not dissolve into the otherworldly diamond radiance of dharmakaya but into the mundane world of my historical existence rendered transparent in sunyata [emptiness]. The ecstasy of transcending space-time appears to be yielding to the transparency of embodied Presence inside space-time. Where is this process leading? (Session 65)</p>

<p>There is a space that is always open in the middle of every moment, every action. Here it was. Unmistakable. Complete freedom in the midst of action. How does one move into it? There is a posture of inner attention that brings freedom and bliss. In which the world moves effortlessly as One. If dropped for an instant, the world falls into its familiar pieces and samsara resumes. A taste. Another lesson to use in daily training.</p>

<p>I started the session with a memory of the Diamond Light of Pure Clarity. I felt how true it is that spending seconds in that pristine
 state undoes countless centuries of wandering lost in samsara. It felt as though all my psychedelic sessions had been one long Ngondro
 preparing me for entry into this reality. I recalled the many rigidities and fixations in me that had been broken down on this journey and
 knew that there was no shortcutting the lengthy purification required for awakening.</p>

<p>I entered the last two sessions of this series knowing that I was about to stop my work for an unknown period of time. In the sixteenth session, something unexpected happened. When everything disintegrated into its chaotic flow, the pain escalated into a frenzy so extreme that it morphed into an orgy of <em>bhaktian</em> rapture. Just as the suffering reached a fevered pitch, the thought of the Divine flashed in my mind and I surrendered completely. Caught in surging elemental forces, I became a devotee singing to the Divine in ecstatic trance. He was vast, and he played me like a trumpet. My consciousness was the instrument and my life the melody.</p>

<p>I went through many cycles of pain and resolution and then became caught in an acoustic ritual that was restructuring me at the core. The Tibetan chanting in the music blended seamlessly with scenes of primal Africa. I saw visions of a circle of elders surrounded by a large gathering of African dancers moving in rhythmic cadence. I was inside the circle, sometimes alone and sometimes with other initiates. The chanting was a kind of shamanic initiation, a ritual of purification and transformation. There was a violent quality to what was happening, as though I had volunteered for something that had gotten out of control. Nevertheless, I felt safe in the hands of these ancient ones even as they broke me down.</p>

<p>Some of my students also started having unusually deep experiences of some of the concepts I was presenting in class. As I was simply going about my work describing the perennial truths of the world’s religions, some students began to have powerful spiritual openings around these truths, such as impermanence, interdependence, oneness, no-self, and the divine within. Insights long dormant in their unconscious suddenly sprang to life. Symptoms of chakra opening and kundalini arousal began to manifest in the room. Students felt their energy spontaneously shifting to higher centers of awareness, though they often did not have the vocabulary to describe it this way. It was as though they were being activated by more than just the verbal presentation of ideas, as though they were being touched by the actual <em>experience</em> of these realities that now lived in me to some degree because of my psychedelic practice.</p>

<p>The Diamond Light that exploded from my chest in session 38 was the forerunner of what emerged in full splendor now. After going through yet one more intense cycle of death and rebirth, I was taken into a brilliantly clear, supremely luminous radiance. Buddhism calls this radiance <em>dharmakaya</em>—the Clear Light of Absolute Reality. I call it the domain of Diamond Luminosity. This Luminosity captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest in continuing to explore the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me. This was a different order of reality altogether. Its clarity was so overwhelming, its energy so pure that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions.</p>

<p>never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.
Working at very high energetic levels sometimes set in motion processes difficult to integrate in my subtle energy system. If you know Alex Grey’s depictions of powerful energies triggered in deep psychedelic work, you’ll recognize how, after a session, your system can feel achy and stretched. Vajrayana practices—Guru Yoga or deity yoga—gave that energy a place to run when I was back in ordinary consciousness and body. So for clarifying cognitive content, practicing teachings given in sessions, and managing the energetic consequences, a daily spiritual practice is really important.</p>

<p>s clarification in the consciousness of people to whom they have karmic connection. Simple, natural.
So I asked: what would it be like to teach consciously in a transpersonal or integral pedagogy—one that recognizes the innate interconnectivity of consciousness? Not abandoning individual strategies that work, but incorporating focused intentionality and conscious engagement that goes beyond classical teaching. For example, ChÃ¶d is a Vajrayana purification practice. I learned ChÃ¶d for my own spiritual work. Before a class began, when I received the roster, I started incorporating those students into my ChÃ¶d practice. I would literally pray for them throughout the course—for their well-being. Not presuming I know what’s right for them, just praying for their well-being.</p>

<p>essions I was given many practices—told, “Do this, do that”—and I took those into my daily practice.
In the last five years of my work, as I discuss in the Diamond Luminosity chapter, I entered Vajrayana Buddhism. I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.</p>

<p>ferently, where causal-level reality is a different physics, a different landscape of consciousness.
When you open to these depths and then return to ordinary consciousness, it’s really important to have a daily practice to anchor you, to keep your feet on the ground. The skills cultivated in Vipassana or zazen—observation and non-attachment—are precisely the skills you use in a psychedelic session, so they reinforce each other. Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a ChÃ¶d practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions. I immediately learned that practice and began doing it before any session. I would never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.</p>

I also have a sense—because I’ve “died” so many times and gone where I will go when I die physically—that I feel very comfortable with that domain. We’re told over and over that we practice to prepare for the moment of death because it has great potential for accelerating our evolution. I agree. My psychedelic practice has been done in a way to prepare me for the moment of death. The result is that I feel comfortable with death and with navigating what comes after, because I feel I’ve already encountered it in many ways.</p>

<p>developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.
For example, in classic Vajrayana we distinguish between the Samaya Safa and the Jnana sattva. The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa. The living memory of the diamond luminosity is, for me, a more effective spiritual vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.</p>

<p>meditation and Vajrayana in augmenting, supporting, enhancing, stabilizing what you’ve gone through?
Chris Bache
One gift of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation for the power and effectiveness of classic contemplative practices, including Vajrayana. By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.</p>

<p>u’ve used Dharmakaya. Are there other Tibetan or Buddhist terms that relate to what you experienced?
Chris Bache:
Yes. Clear light mind, to me, is closer to the nature of mind in this context. I’m still digesting the differences between Diamond Luminosity as an extra-samsaric reality and Diamond Luminosity as the foundation of nirmanakaya existence. There are many correlations, and all honor to the great beings who have explored these dimensions more deeply than I’ve been able to—always a humble student of the great teachers. I put names as best I can to clarify, but it’s tricky—naming can shrink-wrap and stop the mystery, letting the mind back in where it doesn’t belong. So let me step into a little different framework.</p>

Chris Bache:
In my experience, working at high doses, every session breaks down into two phases: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. There’s the dark, hard, death-and-dying kind of phase, and then the ecstatic phase. In reference to this work, James’ excellent talk this morning about shadow work was on point. Working as I did in a non-therapeutic modality, one of the great gifts I learned from Stan Grof is to completely, absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far as it wants to take you.</p>

<p>sitely clear, beyond imagination. Buddhism calls it Dharmakaya, the absolute reality of clear light.
Over five years and 26 sessions, I was taken into this reality only four times. In between, there was tremendous purification. In these states, you dissolve into light, take on the qualities and boundlessness of light—you dissolve in the crystalline nature of the Divine. I don’t mean divine in any conventional or theistic sense, but I have no other vocabulary for it. In each of those four adventures going deeper, the divine began to come deeper into my body. I was handled carefully and broken down, and then this consciousness brought me to the end of my work, gave me an overview of all my sessions, showed me the whole pattern, and gave me my final instructions. I didn’t know it was over until it called it. I knew then I had to stop.</p>

You could call it ecstasy, and it was, but different from earlier ecstasies. Its most striking characteristic was clarity—clarity, clarity, clarity. It was the context within which all thinking and feeling took place; in itself it was hyper-clear, breathtakingly clear. I understood the teachings that even touching something like this for one second dissolves thousands of years of wandering in the shadows of samsara. I came to understand it as extra-samsaric reality, and a particularly intense version of it. At first I thought of it in terms of sambhagaya because of the extreme bliss, but as I went back to the sources and studied more carefully, I associated it with Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality.</p>

<p>rough cycles of death and rebirth, their significance, and how they facilitate collective awakening.
Chris Bache:
First, what I’m going to describe is my variation on an ancient Buddhist teaching. When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?
Chris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.</p>

But in the five or six years after stopping, I entered what I call the deep sadness—a withdrawal into loneliness from not being able to return to ecstatic experiences of being dissolved into light. I knew I needed to stop; I had to spend years absorbing what I had. But there was such an unfulfilled longing to return that I reached a point where I realized I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children and my students. I wasn’t suicidal; I was living a balanced life. But in my heart, I was waiting to die. Eventually I realized something’s wrong. This is not how this work is supposed to end. I must have made a mistake. I even wondered, Is it possible to have too much God? But I knew the entire physical universe is God; the Divine is everything that exists. So it wasn’t too much God—it was too much transcendence.</p>

<p>ou shared through my lens of a non-psychedelic but cutting-edge spiritual and developmental journey.
Chris Bache:
Absolutely. This is a variation of a universal pattern: if you want to open to deeper truths and a deeper participatory relationship with the universe, you have to empty yourself of everything keeping you small—old ways of thinking and feeling—and those patterns have biological correlates. You go through detoxification—physical as well as mental and emotional. In Tibetan Buddhism, before receiving higher teachings capable of generating awakening, one must first do what’s called NDR, the preparatory practices—five practices you do 100,000 times each. One is full-body prostrations while reciting mantras. You’re going to the ground, lying down, getting up, praying—retuning your mind with mantras, your heart with devotion, and working your body to purify it while purifying mind and heart. That’s how it is for all spiritual practice. If psychedelics push you quickly into a higher state, you then have to purify after you’ve been in that state.</p>

I always had a sitter—my first wife, Carol, a clinical psychologist. She wasn’t fond of what I was doing, but she knew I was committed and agreed to help so I could do it safely. She didn’t take notes; we set up a video camera once, but it’s basically boring to watch—just someone lying down. It’s all internal.

Let me back up: light entered my experiences in many forms and levels—many gradations. I'd experienced light many times in earlier death-rebirth processes. When I talk about the diamond light, it isn't just a metaphor: I'm describing an exceptionally clear and intense awareness, a crystalline light that eventually becomes transparent to itself. In those last five years—the last 26 sessions, about a third of all my work—I entered that reality four times, about once a year. Each time involved more detoxification, and about a year later, I'd re-enter that reality. That’s the kind of larger overview.</p>

<p>love—the sharing of existence, the gestation of conditions that make infinite progression possible.
I see death and rebirth, reincarnation, the bardo—a graded series of levels that reflect our limits and capacities after death. I used to think of the bardo as an opposition, a cloud getting in the way. Now I see it as a compassionate blanket that keeps us safe as we enter deeper communion with the true power. Call it the divine, though our concepts of God are childish compared to the reality. To touch that power before we are fully formed and strong enough would shatter us. We have to be very congealed as individuals to touch that reality and stay conscious and coherent within it. And that’s just the level outside the bardo of this piece of time and space. I don’t know what lies beyond the Dharmakaya or the absolute dimension.</p>

<p>undation. I believe we are on the threshold of becoming a species of Buddhas, Christs, and prophets.
After the benediction of blessings, I felt completely fulfilled. The universe had asked something of me, and in offering it up, I was rewarded with more joy than I could have ever imagined—a philosopher’s dream come true. I had known God, the fertile void, and profound joy. Little did I know I still had five years to go in this journey. After one more cycle of death and rebirth, I entered an extraordinarily clear state of consciousness—which I came to call diamond luminosity. This is what Buddhists refer to as Dharmakaya, the absolute clear light of being. Though I had encountered light in many subtle dimensions before, diamond light is of a different order entirely—ultra-clear, super-luminous, beyond imagination.</p>

<p>to the primal void, the Buddha womb, Satchitananda, the fertile void beneath all manifest existence.
Another session, which I titled "Jesus' Blood," was an overwhelming experience of cosmic love. It's being drenched in a love so deep you realize you've never truly been loved until you've been loved like God loves—a force far deeper than anything I had encountered before. Another pivotal experience was the "birth of the diamond soul." Eleven years prior, I had an experience of my life as a completed whole, from start to finish, but in my fortieth session, I began to sense the integration of all my former lives. It was as if all my previous incarnations were winding together, like a string of white light around a kite spool. When this collective memory hit a critical mass, it exploded, fusing all those individual lives into one, and my consciousness soared beyond any sense of individual existence. I experienced what I call diamond luminosity—my heart ruptured, and my awareness expanded dramatically. This was my first taste of the state where I believe reincarnation is taking us.</p>

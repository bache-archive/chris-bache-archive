<p>This change was so palpable that immediately after the session I decided to learn Chöd myself. Two months later, I received the practice from Lama Tsultrim, and it became a regular part of my spiritual practice. Since that day, I have never done a psychedelic session without doing Chöd first.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics and the reservations some teachers have about them as agents of spiritual transformation. And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances <em>when they are used therapeutically</em>, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶12 (2 · 2)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Purification is one of those “pay me now or pay me later” things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §8 ¶1 (7 · 8)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the great challenges of entering intense psychedelic states of consciousness is learning how to learn from experiences that are breaking all the rules as they redefine the possible. In these states, our deepest instincts are often overturned and reversed. One learns to yield to, even welcome the offensive rather than pull back from it. Painful experiences can become something you seek out rather than avoid. The utterly bizarre can become the familiar so many times that you cannot anticipate what shape the next twist of learning will take. You may find yourself stuck in some endless repetitive maze where it is not clear what is happening, what you are doing to perpetuate this stalemate, or what you might do (or stop doing) to shift the situation. It may not even be clear whether this is a situation you can influence or whether it is something you simply must endure, as the following excerpt illustrates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶6 (1 · 12)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In deep psychedelic work, <em>one learns by becoming</em>. This is especially true when working with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. We cannot transport the egoic self into these depths where it can then “have an experience” of how the world works there. In order to know the universe at these levels, we must <em>become</em> a citizen of these levels. We must <em>become</em> the levels themselves. To do this, our smaller sense of self must cease to be the container of our experience. It must die. Giving up everything is simply the price of inheriting everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶14 (10 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This chapter tells the story of what happened in these four sessions. It is the story of entering the Diamond Light and of the intense purification that took place as this Diamond Light began to work its way more deeply into my physical being. The first two of these sessions focused on entering the Diamond Luminosity at successively deeper levels, the second two on absorbing the Diamond Luminosity into my mind and body. Into this narrative, I will weave two other pieces. The first is a set of new insights into the psychedelic process that emerged at this time. The second is the story of how I came to integrate Vajrayana Buddhist practice into my psychedelic practice and why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶11 (1 · 12)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there is also a second variable at work here, and that is the speed with which we tear these skins away, how impatient we are to know the universe at these depths. If we choose a form of transformational practice in which our conditioning is released slowly, the result is a series of smaller initiations spread over a longer period of time, perhaps even many lifetimes. By contrast, working with a psychedelic like LSD is an example of a transformational practice that triggers an accelerated purification process that gives us quicker access to these realities, but there is a price to be paid for this quicker access. The price is the intensification of the death-rebirth process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶2 (1 · 5)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The choice to work with high doses turned out to have enormous consequences for what unfolded on this journey. It radically expanded not only the <em>depth of consciousness</em> reached but also the <em>breadth of consciousness</em> being activated in each session. It wasn’t simply a matter of eating the same karmic meal in fewer bites, as I had naively thought. Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web. Working at these levels changed not only how deep my experiences went but also who or what was actually having these experiences, what the “working unit” of experience was in a session. In these highly energized conditions, the size of the patient literally expands. What I mean by this will become clearer as we proceed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶22 (1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a <em>cosmic communion</em> to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶14 (1 · 4)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, I think that there is a legitimate role for working judiciously with high doses of LSD in carefully managed sessions conducted in a safe and protected environment. It’s certainly true that high doses tend to overwhelm one’s psychological defenses and shatter one’s egoic identity, but whether this leads to dissociation and dysphoria depends to a great extent on how one engages one’s sessions. The dismantling of one’s psychological boundaries is a frightening, gutwrenching experience both physically and psychologically, but <em>if you are prepared for this unraveling and meet it head-on</em>, it can be both manageable and beneficial.</p>

<p>Fogleman:
What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?
Chris Bache:
It was my first wife, Carol—my sitter in my sessions and a clinical psychologist—who really brought me into Vajrayana. I was more interested in the Zen tradition. I wasn’t interested in all the bells, candles, incense, and fanfare that comes with Vajrayana. But she went there, and I followed her. Through her, I met teachers gathering at the Tara Mandala Buddhist retreat center—Lama sutra malayonis established the center in Colorado—and I began to study there and go into retreats with that lineage. I met their lineage of awakened beings, and they made a deep impression on me. If my karma had introduced me to the great awakened beings of the Zen lineage, I could have gone there just as easily. It was the opportunity to meet these beings and receive teachings that made a large impression.</p>

Chris Bache
I’ve been deeply influenced by all the world’s religions. I began as a Christian and a Catholic—four years in seminary studying for the priesthood. I studied Hebrew and Greek for biblical work. I’ve learned so much from Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Native traditions. The two deepest, longest-lasting influences on me have been Christianity and Buddhism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think my journey affirms the deepest truths of Christianity and of all the world’s religions—Judaism’s Kabbalah, Hinduism, Buddhism—while also, in important ways, eclipsing the religions of the last several thousand years. The universe I was initiated into demanded levels of understanding beyond anything I had learned in those traditions. I had to become operational within a deeper metaphysics.</p>

<p>I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love that description. What was it that so captured you about Grof’s work when you encountered it?
Chris Bache:
I immediately saw that if what he was saying was correct, it had enormous implications—for philosophy, which was my interest—not just for healing in clinical psychology. Here was a method that allowed deep, firsthand access to dimensions of consciousness and, through those dimensions, to dimensions of reality I had seen described in many spiritual literatures. This was a protocol that allowed people to be initiated, if only temporarily—what I call the path of temporary immersion. We have to be careful not to confuse a path of temporary immersion with what I would call the path of abiding presence, the more contemplative, meditational path. But this gave temporary access to states far beyond ordinary egoic awareness and far beyond space-time, to explore the deep structure of the universe itself.</p>

Chris Bache:
First, what I’m going to describe is my variation on an ancient Buddhist teaching. When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>see if I got it right. Welcome to the people who are live and those who are going to join us later.
Chris Bache—the story I know is that he is now a retired professor of religious studies and philosophy from Ohio State University and Youngstown, Ohio. Early in his career he was always interested in mysticism and deep spiritual exploration, and he came upon the work of the legendary psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, who pioneered a protocol for working with high doses of LSD in particular. Chris undertook what turned out to be a 20-year journey of 73 high-dose LSD sessions following the Stan Grof protocol—sessions using 500 to 600 micrograms of LSD, which, for any of you not familiar with that calculation, is a high dose. The protocol involves working at home or in a safe, quiet space with headphones and a carefully curated playlist, eyeshades to block out the light so inner visions aren’t obstructed, and a qualified sitter. In Chris’s case, the sitter was a therapist who knew what she was doing. Generally, he did this on a Saturday, and the following day—again following the Grof protocol—he spent basically the whole day with the headphones on to trigger memories of what was playing when certain experiences and visions occurred, and then meticulously transcribed all that.</p>

<p>blows your psyche completely apart, layer by layer, until eventually you dissolve into the universe.
On Saturday morning you’re in time-space; then you blow yourself apart and dissolve. You’re not functioning as “Chris Bache having an experience.” You dissolve as Chris Bache into some stratum of existence, some field of reality. You become that reality. If you do it well, you have continuity of memory in and out, but you don’t have continuity of identity. Dissolved into these fields of consciousness, you can do things my “Chris Bache” could never do and learn things he could never learn within ordinary time-space reality. You get blown into these realities, live there for a few hours, and then the second miracle happens: you come back and re-integrate your time-space identity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I seem to have a psychological makeup that makes both rhythms—dissolving and re-congealing—easier for me. The letting go into, and the coming back to a single human being, are both important.</p>
<p>Lauren Taus:
So profound. Given that you don’t recommend that, what would you advise for someone seeking to access some of these experiences?</p>

Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>’re a professor of theology and philosophy. What made you go on this journey starting way back when?
Chris Bache:
At first, I think it was a foolish strategy to push it as hard as I did, but I didn’t know any better at the time—or I was young and stupid. I was trained as a philosopher of religion with a passionate desire to understand the deep structure of the universe. I had studied some of the great minds in our Western and Eastern traditions. When I found the methodology that Stan made available, I decided to push it as long and as hard as I could. There was a great deal of suffering, episodically and periodically. But at the end of every episode of intense suffering, there would be a breakthrough into a phase of deep, ecstatic bliss and deep transpersonal encounter. The value of those insights and that ecstasy more than balanced out the transient episodes of suffering.</p>

So you began with the motivation to explore the universe as a philosopher?
Chris Bache
Correct. I’m not a therapist—though I received much healing in this work and am grateful for it. My primary intention, as a philosopher of religion, was to explore the universe as deeply as I could and understand not only my nature but the larger landscape.</p>
<p>Simeon Mihaylov
You’ve said your experiences fit within the larger body of religious and philosophical traditions, which gave you confidence in their genuineness, yet they also pushed boundaries and took you into areas you hadn’t encountered elsewhere. Do psychedelics, then, offer the promise of genuinely new philosophical and spiritual insights? How do you see them fitting into the future development of philosophy and spirituality for our species?</p>
<p>Chris Bache
This is an exciting time and territory. I became convinced early on that psychedelics represent a true before-and-after moment in philosophical reflection. Philosophy, in one way or another, reflects on the breadth of human experience—our own and others’. Here we have an opportunity to temporarily deepen and widen awareness, pushing its boundaries.</p>

<p>Andrew Holecek
Everybody, Andrew Holecek here, and I simply cannot contain my excitement about my guest today, Dr. Christopher Bache. With a brief introduction, we’re going to launch into what I believe will be a revelatory, provocative conversation. Chris, PhD, is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Medical Studies, an emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory board of Grof Legacy Training. Chris’s passion has been the study of the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. An award-winning teacher and international speaker, he has written four books: Life Cycles, a study of reincarnation in light of contemporary consciousness research; Dark Night, Early Dawn, a pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness; The Living Classroom, an exploration of collective fields of consciousness and teaching; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe, the story of his 20-year journey with LSD. Chris is a father of three and lives in Weaverville, North Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy.</p>

<p>Chris Bache:
It turned out that way, yes.

A quick note from the chat: Melanie White says, “Thank you, Chris. I loved the book LSD and the Mind of the Universe, and thank you for sharing your insights tonight.” For those watching online, we’ll take questions from our Zoom audience. Here’s one: how does your process relate to Christology? Did you have Christ avatar experiences, and how does that map onto your journey?</p>
<p>Chris Bache:
Interesting question. Two traditions have had the largest influence on my life—Christianity and Buddhism. I also taught world religions for decades, and the lineages became passionate lovers for me; each taught me so much. While I started within a Christian framework, I came to see that Christ is the fruition of a spiritual impulse in the Middle East that parallels, in seminal ways, the fruition of similar impulses in India, Africa, South America. Larger patterns emerged.</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>Chris Bache describes meeting a guiding intelligence in deep psychedelic practice as an encounter with an</p>
<p>infinite, formless consciousness. Rather than appearing as a deity or personified figure, this presence is</p>
<p>felt as a vast, adaptive intelligence whose qualities shift as one’s own mind is purified and integrated</p>
<p>over many sessions. Bache frames the individual mind as a “seed crystal” that catalyzes specific facets of</p>
<p>experience from the limitless potential of universal consciousness. As practice deepens, the intersection of</p>
<p>individual and universal mind changes, eliciting more profound guidance. Pushing beyond the collective psyche</p>
<p>and Jungian archetypes, he says religious images and concepts fall away, revealing states that outstrip</p>
<p>categories like gods, angels, or cultural frameworks. The guidance remains constant, but its expression is</p>

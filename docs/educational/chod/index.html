      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶5</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This change was so palpable that immediately after the session I decided to learn Chöd myself. Two months later, I received the practice from Lama Tsultrim, and it became a regular part of my spiritual practice. Since that day, I have never done a psychedelic session without doing Chöd first.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §0 ¶14</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This chapter tells the story of what happened in these four sessions. It is the story of entering the Diamond Light and of the intense purification that took place as this Diamond Light began to work its way more deeply into my physical being. … Into this narrative, I will weave… the story of how I came to integrate Vajrayana Buddhist practice into my psychedelic practice and why.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §2 ¶12</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Purification is one of those ‘pay me now or pay me later’ things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. … If one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to do in an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶13</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics and the reservations some teachers have about them as agents of spiritual transformation. And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. … I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against ‘taking drugs that cloud the mind’ applies to psychedelic substances <em>when they are used therapeutically</em>, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. … LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind.”</p>

<p>Fogleman: What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?<br />
Bache: …Through [my wife], I met teachers gathering at the <strong>Tara Mandala</strong> Buddhist retreat center… and I began to study there… I met their lineage of awakened beings, and they made a deep impression on me.<br />

<p>“When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating <strong>bodhicitta</strong>—the wish to save all sentient beings… The last step is <strong>distributing the merit</strong>… In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.”<br />

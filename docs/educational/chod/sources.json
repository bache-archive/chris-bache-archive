If you know Alex Grey’s depictions of powerful energies triggered in deep psychedelic work, you’ll recognize how, after a session, your system can feel achy and stretched. Vajrayana practices—Guru Yoga or deity yoga—gave that energy a place to run when I was back in ordinary consciousness and body. So for clarifying cognitive content, practicing teachings given in sessions, and managing the energetic consequences, a daily spiritual practice is really important.",

Simple, natural.\nSo I asked: what would it be like to teach consciously in a transpersonal or integral pedagogy—one that recognizes the innate interconnectivity of consciousness? Not abandoning individual strategies that work, but incorporating focused intentionality and conscious engagement that goes beyond classical teaching. For example, ChÃ¶d is a Vajrayana purification practice. I learned ChÃ¶d for my own spiritual work. Before a class began, when I received the roster, I started incorporating those students into my ChÃ¶d practice. I would literally pray for them throughout the course—for their well-being. Not presuming I know what’s right for them, just praying for their well-being.",

I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.",

The skills cultivated in Vipassana or zazen—observation and non-attachment—are precisely the skills you use in a psychedelic session, so they reinforce each other. Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.\n\nIn the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a ChÃ¶d practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions. I immediately learned that practice and began doing it before any session. I would never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.",

The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa. The living memory of the diamond luminosity is, for me, a more effective spiritual vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.",

By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence.

When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.",

        "text": "ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?\nChris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.",

I knew I needed to stop; I had to spend years absorbing what I had. But there was such an unfulfilled longing to return that I reached a point where I realized I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children and my students. I wasn’t suicidal; I was living a balanced life. But in my heart, I was waiting to die. Eventually I realized something’s wrong. This is not how this work is supposed to end. I must have made a mistake. I even wondered, Is it possible to have too much God?

This is a variation of a universal pattern: if you want to open to deeper truths and a deeper participatory relationship with the universe, you have to empty yourself of everything keeping you small—old ways of thinking and feeling—and those patterns have biological correlates. You go through detoxification—physical as well as mental and emotional. In Tibetan Buddhism, before receiving higher teachings capable of generating awakening, one must first do what’s called NDR, the preparatory practices—five practices you do 100,000 times each. One is full-body prostrations while reciting mantras. You’re going to the ground, lying down, getting up, praying—retuning your mind with mantras, your heart with devotion, and working your body to purify it while purifying mind and heart. That’s how it is for all spiritual practice. If psychedelics push you quickly into a higher state, you then have to purify after you’ve been in that state.\n\nAviv Shahar:\nYou either need to pay on the front end, during, or after.\n\nChris Bache:\nPay now or pay me later, but you have to pay.",

She didn’t take notes; we set up a video camera once, but it’s basically boring to watch—just someone lying down. It’s all internal. I’m not in touch with Carol except through the music in the room and, occasionally, a word or two. I’m so far outside time-space that I barely relate to what’s happening around me, but she was always there taking care of me.\n\nWas she influenced by my sessions? Yes and no. Carol never did psychedelics. She’s a serious Vajrayana practitioner—she completed a three-year retreat with her vajra teacher—and has deep commitments to her lineage. I learned a lot from her.

It was as if all my previous incarnations were winding together, like a string of white light around a kite spool.

Chöd means “cutting.” It is a Vajrayana Buddhist practice for removing obstacles and cutting through ego. Its lineage traces back to Machig Labdrön, a revered female practitioner from eleventh-century Tibet. Carol had received the practice from her teacher, Lama Tsultrim Allione, who had received it from her teacher, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. I quickly accepted her invitation because it felt timely. The previous session had finished well, and today felt like it would be a good day. So on this particular morning, we started the day with Carol doing Chöd over me for forty minutes, and then we began the session.",

In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.",

Nothing holds its existence by itself but is always transparent to the underlying matrix of cause and effect. When one experiences emptiness, one experiences the complete absence of an independent self, not only in one’s own person but in all reality. In this session, I experienced emptiness and Oneness as two sides of the same coin. When we experience the universe as One, it is clear that independent, separate things do not exist. Conversely, when the separate self dissolves completely, the Oneness of life spontaneously rises in our awareness.",

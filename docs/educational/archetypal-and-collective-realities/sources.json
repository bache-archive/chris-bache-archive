It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.",

The psychedelic experiences presented in this chapter suggest that the collective unconscious organizes its vast store of memories in a similar fashion. It appears to gather the memories of humanity into *giant memory clusters* that come from different people and different historical periods but share a common emotional theme. I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems.

But Sheldrake goes further than Jung in proposing that the collective psyche also receives and integrates the learning of its members. Sheldrake envisions a complex feedback loop operating between the species-mind and individuals that allows the species-mind to learn as its members learn. Collective learning progresses more slowly than individual learning, but when the species-mind eventually grasps a truth, the resulting shift ripples through the entire species resulting in faster learning curves.",

In my experience, after about a year and a half—11 or 12 sessions, not much time given how vast archetypal reality is—I moved through it fairly quickly, not its breadth but penetrating through, and then entered yet another death and rebirth. It was a dying out of the greater real into an even greater real—letting go of another layer of assumptions—and entering a year of tremendously powerful experiences that I grouped as causal oneness.",

When I went beyond archetypal reality into causal reality, all dualisms dissolved. You experience the world—whatever aspect you’re encountering—as a unified, single entity, a single consciousness. Plotinus says, “The world breathes as one.” There’s a radical transparency where you encounter the wholeness of life that doesn’t negate differentiation; it affirms it, as different manifestations of a single, undivided whole we call God, the Divine, or the One. That’s a different category of experience altogether from archetypal reality.\n\nEmmy Vadnais: Why is it termed archetypal reality for those unfamiliar with archetypes?",

When I entered into archetypal reality and died as a human being—died to my species identity—my sessions took me outside the operational range of our collective psyche, beyond human experience and history. Moving beyond the collective psyche, everything associated with it fell away: our understandings and projections of God, the flotsam and jetsam of history. I moved into increasingly clear, contentless states of consciousness that are hard to describe. We should be careful with language: “universal mind” or “cosmic mind” are huge concepts. The only part of that mind I know is what it taught me. There was a consciousness that took me in, taught me, ground me up into dust, and took me deeper into itself. Even so, I was experiencing aspects—fractal manifestations—of its totality. My language peters out at that depth. In Diamond Luminosity, I had a clear perception of moving outside Samsara, outside the Bardo, into a reality even beyond archetypal reality. There was a period of being born into archetypal reality, and then a process of being born out of it into a level that pre-exists archetypal reality—absolutely non-physical.",

For me, entities reflect levels of reality.

Would you like to say more?\nChris Bache:\nMy first concern was that it sounded like ego gone amok—ego inflation. I had to sit with that a long time, because my experiences told me that’s not what was happening. As you said, it’s a very different worldview. In the classic individual patient model, the individual is having experiences. The individual has transpersonal experiences, and the individual is always at the center. In this model, my individual existence was completely secondary. It becomes not a matter of my being central. I got the system started, but I dissolved completely into preexisting fields of consciousness. Those fields are the dynamic force having the experiences.\n\nThat manifested not only in the ocean of suffering, but later in archetypal reality and causal oneness. In many experiences, Chris Bache was a bit player. In the book I have an appendix: what dies and is reborn? After so many deaths and rebirths, it becomes a cognitive question. What is actually dying? It feels personal. Is it just ego dying over and over?",

We have a deep, visceral identity that’s deeper than our individual egoic identity, and to die as a human being is deeper than to die as an individual human being. To go into archetypal reality, I had to cease functioning cognitively in human terms and acclimate to flows of reality profoundly beyond not only my individual existence but beyond human existence. I moved outside the human field to levels of archetypal reality: a high, Platonic level—something like what Plato points to, except Plato’s archetypes are eternal forms in the mind of an unchanging God, and I experienced them as vast, living beings, overwhelmingly beyond my capacity to comprehend; I could touch pieces, but they were far too large. At a lower subtle level, I entered deep into the collective unconscious of humanity—the species mind—experiencing the human species as a single being, with networks of intelligence weaving our individual efforts, minds, and karma into larger patterns by which the species as a whole lives and breathes. I think I was being given a crash course in how our species works as a single organism to prepare for what came next.",

You said these beings live through humanity, experience through humanity, love through humanity.\nChris Bache:\nI’ve had reservations about that particular line, but I kept it in because it’s in my original notes. When the ocean of suffering culminated, it exploded me into a deeper level of consciousness. The distinctive qualities were twofold: it was incredibly ancient—beyond anything I’d imagined—and more real than time and space. I eventually came to understand it as archetypal reality: a level that exists before time and space and contributes fundamental structures to them. The vision is that all reality emerges out of a primal One which starts as a void and manifests as the Big Bang. Between the One and even the Big Bang, there are many gradations—unfoldings of the Divine, though I hesitate to use that word because of its connotations. There are many layers, and lower levels are sourced in the actions of higher levels. I was encountering these—whether to call them beings or principles—vast entities others have experienced too. The best my mind could do to give them form was to see them as galaxies—images borrowed from Hubble and James Webb—though they weren’t galaxies, just that massive in scale. These beings were part of creation, creating time and space and some of the structures within it. Far down the line we have human beings. The insight was that all human existence—and, in fact, all existence—was an expression of the intentions of these deeper cosmological principles and beings. I’m not sure I got all the pieces lined up, but I do think all human experience, male and female, is an aspect of a species intelligence; that species intelligence is an aspect of a planetary intelligence, which is an aspect of a solar-system and galactic intelligence. These deeper intelligences manifest as our lives; they experience the world as we do, experiencing the adventures we are having.",

I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown.

How can that be, that an individual awakes yet another does not?\nChris Bache:\nThe metaphor I like to use when teaching my students is that of leaves and the tree. Imagine leaves being individually conscious, yet they are manifestations of the consciousness of the tree. So we are individually conscious, and there is a narrative of individual evolution, but if you really dig deep and ask “what is an individual?” then you encounter the collective psyche—the consciousness of the planet, the galaxy, and then deeper, as you say, the absolute, what I call my belovedness. Individual awakening is a mistaken inference. It’s true that if you don’t work individually, you make no progress, but when you do, you're actually drawing many people's consciousness into your work. So it’s impossible to put a boundary on awakening; the universe doesn't even think in terms of individuals—it's interested in awakening the entire species. Not this religion, that continent, but the whole human family into evolutionary progression.

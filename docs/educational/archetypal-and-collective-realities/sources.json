We’re not used to thinking of physical reality as surface real, with deeper structures being more real—but quantum theory is comfortable with that, string theorists are comfortable with that. We should be comfortable with that in psychology.\n\nLuc Briede-Cooper:\nThere’s something intuitive about that. People do have experiences of degrees of reality sometimes. Sticking with the reality point for a minute: there’s depersonalization/derealization disorder—rare as a disorder, but more than 50% of people experience at least a moment of derealization in their lifetime. There’s also schizophrenia, which has an interesting relationship to mystical visions that Jung noted, and psychedelics can induce or worsen schizophrenic symptoms. The visions in schizophrenia can overlap with psychedelic visions. I’m curious: did your sense of mental illness change after your journeys?",

In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.\n\nIn LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves.

Psychedelics in general, and LSD in particular, function as non-specific amplifiers and catalysts of consciousness. They don’t give you a particular experience; they hyper-amplify your consciousness. If you use those hours of hyper-amplified consciousness carefully—shutting out all outside stimulus and focusing entirely within—you can use them to explore and, in a sense, excavate the deep architecture of the psyche and the nature of consciousness itself.",

When I entered into archetypal reality and died as a human being—died to my species identity—my sessions took me outside the operational range of our collective psyche, beyond human experience and history. Moving beyond the collective psyche, everything associated with it fell away: our understandings and projections of God, the flotsam and jetsam of history. I moved into increasingly clear, contentless states of consciousness that are hard to describe. We should be careful with language: “universal mind” or “cosmic mind” are huge concepts. The only part of that mind I know is what it taught me. There was a consciousness that took me in, taught me, ground me up into dust, and took me deeper into itself. Even so, I was experiencing aspects—fractal manifestations—of its totality. My language peters out at that depth. In Diamond Luminosity, I had a clear perception of moving outside Samsara, outside the Bardo, into a reality even beyond archetypal reality. There was a period of being born into archetypal reality, and then a process of being born out of it into a level that pre-exists archetypal reality—absolutely non-physical.",

Either way, the collective psyche is implicated, and that is perfectly normal and good.\nCHRIS BACHE: At the same time, it is possible to go beyond all collective thought forms and beyond human history. As one does, those forms tend to fade. There is much discussion of entities—especially because DMT and related substances often expose people to them—and I am not suggesting such entities are unreal. For me, entities reflect levels of reality. As one goes deeper, the granular quality of many individual beings yields to levels that are less granular, with fewer distinct beings, and then opens into vast tracts of consciousness that are less individual and less entity-like. At least, that has been my experience.",

First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.\n\nWhat I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.",

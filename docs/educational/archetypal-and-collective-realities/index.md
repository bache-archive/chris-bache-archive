*How Bache frames the collective psyche and archetypal domains: from META-COEX healing to an ontologically prior “bridge” that seeds space-time, with evolving archetypes and participatory disclosure.*

## Curated weave (book-first)

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. […] It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.  
— **LSDMU ch.1 §8 ¶7**

Bache shifts the center of gravity from private healing to the *deep psyche*. At depth, personal dynamics mirror species dynamics.

> The collective psyche appears to organize its memories […] into *giant memory clusters*. […] I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems.  
— **LSDMU ch.4 §2 ¶6**

> This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche […]. […] In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche.  
— **LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶5**

Mechanism: as COEX systems structure the personal unconscious, META-COEX structures the collective; high-energy sessions can catalyze species-level clearing. What domain are we in?

> I experienced archetypal reality to be a bridge between the physical universe and the source of existence […] the seed reality of space-time. […] The archetypal domain is actually a cluster of levels.  
— **LSDMU ch.7 §0 ¶8**

At this bridge, archetypes aren’t static molds.

> [I] use the term in a quasi-Jungian sense […] patterns in the collective unconscious […]. […] I see the collective psyche as itself learning and evolving over time, and therefore I see archetypes at this level as evolving over time.  
— **LSDMU ch.7 §10 ¶4**

Participation matters.

> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. […] Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience […].  
— **LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶2**

Taken together: a participatory passage from personal COEX to collective META-COEX, through a living, evolving archetypal bridge that informs—and learns from—our species-mind.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU ch.4 §2 ¶6**  
> The collective psyche appears to organize its memories in ways that parallel how the personal unconscious organizes its memories. […] It appears to gather the memories of humanity into *giant memory clusters* […] I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems. […]

**LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶5**  
> This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. […] In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. […]

**LSDMU ch.7 §0 ¶8**  
> I experienced archetypal reality to be a bridge between the physical universe and the source of existence. […] Being ontologically prior to space-time in the Great Chain of Being, it is the seed reality of space-time. […]

**LSDMU ch.7 §10 ¶4**  
> Second, I use the term in a quasi-Jungian sense to describe patterns in the collective unconscious of humanity—patterns of collective memory, collective thought, collective learning, and even collective physiology. […] I see the collective psyche as itself learning and evolving over time, and therefore I see archetypes at this level as evolving over time. […]

**LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶2**  
> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. […] Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of […] the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.

**(Optional, contextual) LSDMU ch.7 §7 ¶9**  
> Experiencing human existence as a completely unified field made everything much easier to understand. […] I was now experiencing as a centralized decision to incarnate entire generations to cleanse the human mind-field of its collective karmic legacy. […]

## Supporting transcript quotes (verbatim)

> In my experience, there were two archetypal levels: a high subtle level and a low subtle level. At the high subtle level—what I think of as Platonic—I encountered living forms responsible for creating spacetime […]. At the lower subtle, more Jungian level, I entered into the living tissue of the collective psyche. […] As we heal ourselves, we contribute to healing the collective psyche.

> Where I went next was into the greater realm of archetypal reality. […] I entered a state of awareness beyond the collective psyche, and at that level I was being worked with, taught how reality functions.

> At a lower level of archetypal reality—call it a Jungian level—I repeatedly experienced the human psyche and the human species as a single integrated organism […]. The individual is real; the collective is real. They operate on different scales and are mutually implicated.

> My focus wasn’t on groups but on all of humanity. […] Each of our minds is like a fractal spark within a species mind; each of our bodies a cell within an integrated body of humanity. […] Very similar to Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic fields theory.

> Why isn’t this just echoes of my personal unconscious […]? […] The cosmology that emerges in psychedelic states is echoed in the work of other psychedelicists […] There is a convergence of experience at deep levels.

> As one goes deeper, the granular quality of many individual beings yields to levels that are less granular […] and then opens into vast tracts of consciousness that are less individual and less entity-like.

> When I entered into archetypal reality and died as a human being—died to my species identity—[…] I moved into increasingly clear, contentless states of consciousness […] beyond archetypal reality.

## Notes & synthesis

Book passages establish the ontology (archetypal as seed/bridge) and mechanism (COEX → META-COEX; participatory disclosure). Transcripts confirm two archetypal tiers (high/Platonic vs low/Jungian), add species-organism imagery, and clarify that entities/thought-forms thin out with depth. Together they depict evolving archetypes within a learning species-mind.

> reckoning: archetypal reality. The collective suffering never reappeared in any subsequent session.
Chris Bache:
Where I went next was into the greater realm of archetypal reality. I entered a reality that was more real than physical reality—like Plato’s cave, where someone escapes the cave and enters a world more real than the physical, which is disorienting at first. When I entered archetypal reality, I stayed there in my sessions for the next year and a half. I went through a death deeper than ego death: I had to cease to be a human being in any way, shape, or form. My consciousness could no longer operate within the confines of even our collective psyche. I entered a state of awareness beyond the collective psyche, and at that level I was being worked with, taught how reality functions.

Emmy Vadnais: Why is it termed archetypal reality for those unfamiliar with archetypes?
Jeffrey Mishlove: I use “archetype” in two senses. Jung talked about archetypes as primary themes of human experience that become concretized in forms—wise old man, wise old woman, trickster, shadow—the dominant themes of the collective psyche. The second sense is Platonic: Plato’s discovery of a level of reality beyond time and space altogether.

I experienced both, though not as Plato described them. He thought of archetypes as unchanging prototypes within the mind of an unchanging, infinite being. I experienced them as living entities—but living on a vast scale of time and space far beyond anything we know within time and space. What is shared is that for something to manifest in time and space, it comes out of the oneness through these fundamental intermediate structures—super-intelligent, super-powerful—focusing energy down into manifestation.

> collective psyche and was gradually being taught how to experience how reality works at that level.
In my experience, there were two archetypal levels: a high subtle level and a low subtle level. At the high subtle level—what I think of as Platonic—I encountered living forms responsible for creating spacetime and its core structures. They were vast, enormous, like galaxies billions of light years across. They were archetypes, not static ideas in the mind of an unchanging god, but living forms evolving over vast tracts of time. At the lower subtle, more Jungian level, I entered into the living tissue of the collective psyche. I had experiences of the wholeness that the human psyche and even the human body represents—how we’re all fractal manifestations of a larger pattern, and how each of us, by healing our personal diseases, contributes to the collective, archetypal human body becoming stronger through history.

> ings seriously as saying something about the nature of reality, rather than just an inner adventure?
Chris Bache:
Good question—and the critical one. Why isn’t this just echoes of my personal unconscious or of the collective unconscious, rather than something that goes beyond those canyon walls? A couple of things.

First, are the experiences replicable? Do they show up in the sessions of other people? If it were just me describing these levels of reality, it might be as you say. But the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic states is echoed in the work of other psychedelicists—if they’re using a method and substance with sufficient power to break through the same number of layers. There is a convergence of experience at deep levels; when I describe my experiences, other journeyers recognize them as reflecting their own.

> amed it. I couldn’t penetrate beyond that; they were too big and foreign to give them coherent form.
At a lower level of archetypal reality—call it a Jungian level—I repeatedly experienced the human psyche and the human species as a single integrated organism, with physical and mental networks connecting it like neurology. I was shown how the individual is hardwired and soft-wired into this matrix, how the species mind informs our individual consciousness, and how our individual work reaches out to inform and structure future species consciousness. I saw that each of us carries a holographic, fractal piece of the diseases of our time—mental and physical—and as we heal ourselves, we contribute to healing the collective psyche. In that sense, you could say the collective psyche is more real than the individual psyche, though I’d put it differently: the individual is real; the collective is real. They operate on different scales and are mutually implicated. And both are transcended by Platonic, archetypal levels radically beyond our human collective psyche.

> the collective psyche. He further proposes that deeper journeys often move beyond entity-populated,
granular realms into vaster, less individuated fields of consciousness. Alongside sacred forms, powerful secular

aggregates—like greed or anger—operate similarly as collective thought forms.

HOST: At an integration circle, someone told me he encountered Ganesh, the elephant god of Hinduism. After your journeys, how do you understand the meaning of meeting a deity in a particular form?

CHRIS BACHE: When we experience realities beyond our ordinary consciousness and tap qualities like infinite compassion, infinite intelligence, and infinite creativity—qualities long associated with deities—it is not surprising that our psyche matches the phenomenology of the experience with the qualities of deities we know. Sometimes, however, we meet deities that are not part of our lineage and perhaps not even in our awareness. They can appear completely out of left field, yet take the recognizable cultural form of a deity—Ganesh, Jesus, Mary, the Prophet Muhammad, and others.

> edelics is about.

Ryan Kemp
Would you describe that as what Jung termed the collective unconscious?
Chris Bache
The collective unconscious is a stratum of consciousness below the personal unconscious. In Jung’s model, when we go below our conscious mind, we first encounter our personal unconscious. If you go deeper, you enter a stream of awareness shared by all human beings of your species—Jung’s collective psyche. Deeper still, you can enter broader streams—what some would call global consciousness—and then levels that go beyond space-time altogether: archetypal levels, complete states of dissolving into non-duality and what might be called causal oneness, and deeper states even than that. It’s a long journey with many levels of exploration along the way.

Ryan Kemp
So, as in Jung and in many spiritual and religious texts, we have our personal, individual mind, but the universe itself is a mind, a oneness of its own. Is that correct?

> se of that is very different from the tumultuous confusion that can arise in a pathological context.
Luc Briede-Cooper:
You mentioned the five levels—the personal, the collective, the archetypal, the causal oneness, and the Diamond Luminosity. Could you take us up through those? I know you’ve said elsewhere it’s a hard question to talk about, so I won’t press too hard.

Chris Bache:
We’ve gone into archetypal reality and the collective dimension. In my experience, after about a year and a half—11 or 12 sessions, not much time given how vast archetypal reality is—I moved through it fairly quickly, not its breadth but penetrating through, and then entered yet another death and rebirth. It was a dying out of the greater real into an even greater real—letting go of another layer of assumptions—and entering a year of tremendously powerful experiences that I grouped as causal oneness.

> ad to fall away to enter levels that humanity as a whole has not experienced, or only very few have.
Even in archetypal reality, you’re dealing with profound consciousness, but there’s still dualism—a sense of self and other. When I went beyond archetypal reality into causal reality, all dualisms dissolved. You experience the world—whatever aspect you’re encountering—as a unified, single entity, a single consciousness. Plotinus says, “The world breathes as one.” There’s a radical transparency where you encounter the wholeness of life that doesn’t negate differentiation; it affirms it, as different manifestations of a single, undivided whole we call God, the Divine, or the One. That’s a different category of experience altogether from archetypal reality.

> ou feel you were encountering something on a scale much larger than humanity, truly cosmic in scope?
Chris Bache
Yes, absolutely. When I entered into archetypal reality and died as a human being—died to my species identity—my sessions took me outside the operational range of our collective psyche, beyond human experience and history. Moving beyond the collective psyche, everything associated with it fell away: our understandings and projections of God, the flotsam and jetsam of history. I moved into increasingly clear, contentless states of consciousness that are hard to describe. We should be careful with language: “universal mind” or “cosmic mind” are huge concepts. The only part of that mind I know is what it taught me. There was a consciousness that took me in, taught me, ground me up into dust, and took me deeper into itself. Even so, I was experiencing aspects—fractal manifestations—of its totality. My language peters out at that depth. In Diamond Luminosity, I had a clear perception of moving outside Samsara, outside the Bardo, into a reality even beyond archetypal reality. There was a period of being born into archetypal reality, and then a process of being born out of it into a level that pre-exists archetypal reality—absolutely non-physical.

> ment itself. Either way, the collective psyche is implicated, and that is perfectly normal and good.
CHRIS BACHE: At the same time, it is possible to go beyond all collective thought forms and beyond human history. As one does, those forms tend to fade. There is much discussion of entities—especially because DMT and related substances often expose people to them—and I am not suggesting such entities are unreal. For me, entities reflect levels of reality. As one goes deeper, the granular quality of many individual beings yields to levels that are less granular, with fewer distinct beings, and then opens into vast tracts of consciousness that are less individual and less entity-like. At least, that has been my experience.

> any insights on how psychedelics or raising consciousness might help us find a better path forward?
Chris Bache:
Let’s hold the second part and address the first, because this was one of the biggest surprises of my work. First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.

What I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.

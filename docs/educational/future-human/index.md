*A species-level awakening: Bache’s Future Human names the form, mechanism, and labor by which humanity becomes a Diamond-clear, fully embodied, spiritually transparent civilization.*

## Curated weave (book-first)

> “The core vision of our future … is that humanity is coming into a time of **Great Awakening** … But for there to be a Great Awakening, there must first take place a **Great Death**.”  
> — **LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶8**

Bache frames the Future Human as a collective transformation, not a private attainment. The vantage comes from dissolving into the species-mind, where personal boundaries thin and long rhythms surface (see ch.9 §0 ¶9).

> “When the ‘small-self’ opens to the ‘species-self’ … insights into humanity’s larger developmental trajectory sometimes emerge.”  
> — **LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶9**

The **form** of this emergence coheres with his Diamond Luminosity work: the Future Human equals the Diamond Soul—Spirit and Matter in lucid balance (ch.9 §4 ¶1, §4 ¶9).

> “What will our evolutionary future self look like? … the form that the Future Human will take will be the **Diamond Soul**.”  
> — **LSDMU ch.9 §4 ¶1**

> “Ninety-five percent of the work … is gestation across deep time … The Future Human *is* the Diamond Soul.”  
> — **LSDMU ch.9 §4 ¶9**

Crucially, this is not abstract: he is briefly “carried into the distant future” and allowed to **try on** that state—clear, whole, tantric integration of Spirit and Matter (ch.9 §1 ¶34), later revisiting the “splendid creature” to steady courage for difficult years (ch.11 §0 ¶37).

> “Just touching it filled me with rapture … fully embodied spiritual realization … Spirit and Matter in perfect balance.”  
> — **LSDMU ch.9 §1 ¶34**

Talks reaffirm the arc: a turning point (“before-and-after”), a century of labor, and agency—**conditional** futures enacted by us.

> “We’re either going to go extinct or we’re going to transition … The next point is to wake up to who we really are.”

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶8**  
> The core vision of our future that has emerged in my sessions is that humanity is coming into a time of Great Awakening, a profound shift in the fundamental condition of the human psyche. But for there to be a Great Awakening, there must first take place a Great Death. We must be emptied of the old before the new can emerge. I have come to believe that the twentyfirst century will be such a time. It will begin the *dark night of our collective soul*, a time of emptying, of intense anguish, of loss of control and breakdown. A global purification unto death that will last generations. But through this hard labor, we will give birth to something extraordinary. More than just a new civilization, what is emerging is nothing less than a new order of human being. I believe that through the global systems crisis, our planet is giving birth to the Future Human.

**LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶9**  
> I know it sounds arrogant to speak on such a scale, but I must if lam to describe the visions that repeatedly came through my sessions. Ego-death destroys the existential isolation and constant self-referencing that organizes our ordinary experience of the world. When the partitions of personal consciousness are surrendered, our experience spontaneously opens to the larger rhythms of life that we are part of. One portion of these rhythms is the collective psyche of our species. At the subtle level of consciousness, we can dissolve into the human species-mind so deeply that the beginnings and endings of our personal life become insignificant. When the “small-self” opens to the “species-self” this completely, it is only natural that insights into humanity’s larger developmental trajectory sometimes emerge in our awareness. We would be surprised if this did not happen.

**LSDMU ch.9 §4 ¶1**  
> If history or nature or the Creative Intelligence of the universe is giving birth to a new form of human consciousness on this planet, the next question becomes, What form will this Future Human take? What will our evolutionary future self look like? To address this question, I want to connect the vision of the Great Awakening presented here with the vision of the birth of the Diamond Soul presented in the previous chapter. There is such a striking convergence of themes in these two visions that the longer I have held them both in my awareness, the more I have come to see them as deeply intertwined. I offer the following thoughts as a brief explanation for why I believe the form that the Future Human will take will be the Diamond Soul.

**LSDMU ch.9 §1 ¶34**  
> At one point, I was given a brief experience of the Future Human we are becoming. It was as though I had been carried into the distant future and allowed to try on for size what will be the abiding state of humanity at that time. What a magnificent being! Just touching it filled me with rapture, calm, and sheer delight. It felt clear, warm, and whole. There was an abiding sense of Oneness that went deeper than just the feeling of being interconnected. It was a feeling of being truly One underneath the diversity of life. Such expansiveness, such breadth of being! It was fully embodied spiritual realization, the tantric awakening of our entire species, Spirit and Matter in perfect balance. This penetrating glimpse transfixed me. Its beauty, grandeur, and simplicity pierced my heart. This awakening poured a delicious and healing nectar into me, a balm for all my kind.

**LSDMU ch.9 §4 ¶9**  
> And finally, one last point. When we come through this collective labor, we will discover that 95 percent of the work of creating this Future Human was already accomplished before our labor began. The birth of the Future Human is the culmination of a gestational process that has been underway for hundreds of thousands of years. Through the systematic expansion and integration of our human capacity lifetime after lifetime, we have been growing toward this historic breakthrough. Gestation is long and slow, but birth is sudden and quick. Our planet is going into labor and will soon give us no choice but to deliver our deeper self into history. The form of our future is implicit in our past. The Future Human *is* the Diamond Soul.

**LSDMU ch.11 §0 ¶37**  
> The time frame within which all this was taking place was staggering. In a final and deeply moving portion of the session, I entered humanity's deep future again and spent time with the FORM of the being we are becoming—the Future Human. What a splendid creature! What grace and nobility! It was such a privilege to experience this being and so helpful as we enter the difficult years ahead. The people need a vision of what we are becoming—of the extraordinary beauty that is emerging from our tangled past.

**LSDMU ch.8 §1 ¶49**  
> In the final analysis, I think that whether we remain inside the physical universe after waking up spiritually or leave it behind are not mutually exclusive options but simultaneous possibilities. If we were to achieve enlightenment and leave spacetime for one hundred thousand years and then return, we would find the universe continuing to patiently grow her children through the steady and relentless accumulation of experience in rebirth. If we leave again, this time for a million years, upon our return we would find the same thing—Nature growing humanity into ever richer forms. In such a universe, how could life not eventually produce fully awakened Souls on Earth? Not just a few here and there, but everyone everywhere. An entire species that through its hard labor has given birth to its next self-expression—a fully conscious Soul, green to its roots, feet firmly planted on the Earth but now transparent to the Creative Intelligence that everywhere presses in upon it. This is the vision of history I now turn to explore.

## Notes & synthesis
The book establishes the conceptual architecture—Great Death/Awakening, species-mind access, Diamond Soul identity—while the talks concretize timing metaphors (gestation → labor), conditionality (agency), and the felt “try-on” preview. No major tensions; interviews simply simplify or dramatize the book’s core claims.

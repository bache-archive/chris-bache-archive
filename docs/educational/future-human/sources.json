What does the future human look like?\nChris Bache:\nI think our spiritual traditions have been giving us insights into what’s emerging. All of the great saints and sages who seeded the religions of the Axial Age drew humanity to them because we could feel a deep resonance. They were archetypal prototypes of what we were becoming, and they invited us to become what they had become. In the Buddhas, the prophets, the Christ, and the great saints of the deepest spiritual traditions, we can see prototypes of what’s coming.",

Is that right?\nChris Bache:\nThere are two different models: one is that it’ll keep expanding forever; the other is that it reaches a maximum expansion and then contracts—a pulsating universe expanding and contracting, then re-expanding. I don’t have an answer to that question. Clearly, the universe is on a tear, going on for billions and billions of years. That’s a deflating insight if you think a human being is simply a 100-year-old being; then we’re sand on the beach beside the ocean—we don’t get to participate in that deep future. But if reincarnation is true—and I think there’s plenty of factual evidence that it is—and if our essence is indestructible, and we roll over what we’ve learned into continued learning over thousands and millions of years, then we actually get to participate in this divine unfolding. It’s our future. We are co-participants—eternal participants—in this eternal process.\n\nEmmy Vadnais:\nIn your experiences, you talked about the birth of the future human. Can you shed a little light on what that is about?",

Can you shed a little light on what that is about?\nChris Bache:\nThere’s a chapter in the book called “The Birth of the Future Human.” I think it may be the most important chapter, and it completely surprised me. I thought my work was a personal journey—healing, awakening. Then it broadened into an individual’s insight into the deep structure of our lives. But starting around 1990 through 1995, I began receiving a series of internally consistent visions about humanity’s evolutionary destiny: where we were in our journey, that we were coming to a turning point, a crescendo that would catalyze a tremendous transformation inside humanity—a true before-and-after moment in time. A profound spiritual transformation was coming to a head. This kept repeating itself in my work in different ways, but I didn’t know how the universe was going to pull it off.",

In 1995, I dissolved into the species mind, into what I call deep time, taken into the future where I experienced a death-and-rebirth of the human family—not as individuals, but humanity as a whole. It was a global systems crisis precipitated by escalating ecological crises. I wasn’t given details, dates, nothing about artificial intelligence or a third world war—just the experience of a prolonged loss of control and a collapse of everything considered normal and necessary. Since then, I’ve lived with this awareness. For me, it’s not a projected fantasy; it’s an experience, so I don’t question its truth. I see this period as one of increasing destabilization: conflicts between races, religions, sexes, classes—tremendous things we’ve done to each other for thousands of years. We have to grow spiritually into the next form emerging in the human. I think this process will continue to deepen for decades. What’s unfolding now is the overture, bringing to the surface age-old hatreds that we must transform. I don’t offer political solutions; my perspective isn’t ground-level. It’s from far above the Earth, looking at the long evolutionary trajectory.",

Please expand on that before we close.\nChris Bache:\nIn the 70th vision, I was given what I consider the last great vision of my journey; after that, it was wrapping up. I was taken into deep time and shown three core experiences. One was an insight into how humanity is designed for accelerated evolution. On the surface, we reincarnate: we learn, grow, change, make decisions, and return different. But beneath the incarnating self is a deeper structure that holds all our incarnational memories—a fundamental blueprint from which we act. Humanity grows and changes individually, while a very specific structure in the collective psyche accumulates and stores that information. Periodically, that deeper structure pivots—what I call a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. It’s the genius of creation: we learn individually, it collects at a deeper level, and when that deeper level shifts, all subsequent individual experience unfolds from that changed fundamental psyche. After the birth of the future human, all future incarnations of human beings will operate out of this transformed collective psyche—and the process continues. Individuals learn and grow; it’s collected at depth; that level learns and grows—like Rupert Sheldrake talks about morphogenic fields—an ongoing, continuously evolving process.",

I thought it was about personal transformation, even personal enlightenment. I never imagined that the evolution of the species would become such a dominant theme. Going back to about halfway through the work in the early ’90s, starting in 1991, I began to have a series of visions—just dropped into my sessions—that humanity was coming to a turning point, a true before-and-after point in history. We were entering a time of intense purification, essentially purifying the human psyche of the sins of our fathers—lifting the conditioning of the past to make us more receptive to, and capable of internalizing, the spiritual infusion, insights, and power becoming available at this time in history. There was a tremendous sense of rebirth coming.",

What may be powerful and true for one person won’t necessarily be powerful or true for another. I can only share what my experience has been. Early on—starting around my 23rd session, so for the last 50 or so—one of the recurring themes was where humanity is going. The vision was repeated again and again: we are coming into a turning point in history, a decisive before-and-after point, poised on the edge of a magnificent transition into a higher level of functioning.

In other sessions, I was taken far into the future and experienced this new archetype. I believe in reincarnation—my first book was on reincarnation—and from a philosopher’s perspective, I think the empirical evidence is overwhelming. It’s always been part of my thinking, based on the evidence, not religious belief. I experienced reincarnation dynamics many times in my sessions—not only my personal reincarnational history, but reincarnation as a dynamic process for the entire planet. The entire species is pulsing in the rhythm of reincarnation. If reincarnation is a basic fact of life, then we have been building the future human for hundreds of thousands of years, growing bit by bit. We remember our former lives usually when we die and return to the domain of the soul, but I think we are coming into a point where the soul is becoming conscious inside our historical existence.",

The message was always the same: we’re coming to a turning point, a profound spiritual awakening—a before-and-after in human history. It involves tremendous collective purification, emptying out the pains of history to lay a new foundation for an infusion of divine energy rising within us. I was given glimpses of the transformed humanity that would emerge, but not how nature would pull it off.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1995, when I had transitioned to the Diamond Luminosity phase of my work, I expected to be taken back into that state. Instead, I was dissolved into the species—Chris Bache dissolved into the human family. As the human family, I was taken into the future—into deep time—and experienced what I came to understand as a death-and-rebirth process impacting the entire human family. Just as an individual can undergo an intense death–rebirth process in spiritual or psychedelic practice, history was putting the entire human family through such a process.",

Could you elaborate?\nChris Bache: I explore this in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human,” and earlier in “The Great Awakening” in Dark Night, Early Dawn (2000). I was uncomfortable entering this territory at first—I’m not drawn to historical speculation. I began this work for individual healing and enlightenment, and that premise was blown away within a few years. The purification, the access to information and knowledge—everything seemed to be in service of the species as a whole. It’s not that our species is special in the universe, but the Divine’s focus here, now, seems species-wide.\n\nThis emphasis repeated so often and strongly that the gist of my 20-year journey became the collective story of death and rebirth. I have deep convictions that we’ve entered the dark night of our collective soul—a period of purification, confronting the sins of our fathers and mothers, which are our own through reincarnation. We’re facing our past choices and their consequences, purifying the toxins they left, to open into new dimensions of our being.",

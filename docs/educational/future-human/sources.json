If we leave again, this time for a million years, upon our return we would find the same thing—Nature growing humanity into ever richer forms. In such a universe, how could life not eventually produce fully awakened Souls on Earth? Not just a few here and there, but everyone everywhere. An entire species that through its hard labor has given birth to its next self-expression—a fully conscious Soul, green to its roots, feet firmly planted on the Earth but now transparent to the Creative Intelligence that everywhere presses in upon it.

I wasn’t given details, dates, nothing about artificial intelligence or a third world war—just the experience of a prolonged loss of control and a collapse of everything considered normal and necessary. Since then, I’ve lived with this awareness. For me, it’s not a projected fantasy; it’s an experience, so I don’t question its truth. I see this period as one of increasing destabilization: conflicts between races, religions, sexes, classes—tremendous things we’ve done to each other for thousands of years.

On the surface, we reincarnate: we learn, grow, change, make decisions, and return different. But beneath the incarnating self is a deeper structure that holds all our incarnational memories—a fundamental blueprint from which we act. Humanity grows and changes individually, while a very specific structure in the collective psyche accumulates and stores that information. Periodically, that deeper structure pivots—what I call a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. It’s the genius of creation: we learn individually, it collects at a deeper level, and when that deeper level shifts, all subsequent individual experience unfolds from that changed fundamental psyche. After the birth of the future human, all future incarnations of human beings will operate out of this transformed collective psyche—and the process continues.

What may be powerful and true for one person won’t necessarily be powerful or true for another. I can only share what my experience has been. Early on—starting around my 23rd session, so for the last 50 or so—one of the recurring themes was where humanity is going. The vision was repeated again and again: we are coming into a turning point in history, a decisive before-and-after point, poised on the edge of a magnificent transition into a higher level of functioning. There is a greatness emerging within humanity.",

In other sessions, I was taken far into the future and experienced this new archetype. I believe in reincarnation—my first book was on reincarnation—and from a philosopher’s perspective, I think the empirical evidence is overwhelming. It’s always been part of my thinking, based on the evidence, not religious belief. I experienced reincarnation dynamics many times in my sessions—not only my personal reincarnational history, but reincarnation as a dynamic process for the entire planet. The entire species is pulsing in the rhythm of reincarnation. If reincarnation is a basic fact of life, then we have been building the future human for hundreds of thousands of years, growing bit by bit. We remember our former lives usually when we die and return to the domain of the soul, but I think we are coming into a point where the soul is becoming conscious inside our historical existence.",

The message was always the same: we’re coming to a turning point, a profound spiritual awakening—a before-and-after in human history. It involves tremendous collective purification, emptying out the pains of history to lay a new foundation for an infusion of divine energy rising within us. I was given glimpses of the transformed humanity that would emerge, but not how nature would pull it off.\n\nSeveral years later, in 1995, when I had transitioned to the Diamond Luminosity phase of my work, I expected to be taken back into that state. Instead, I was dissolved into the species—Chris Bache dissolved into the human family. As the human family, I was taken into the future—into deep time—and experienced what I came to understand as a death-and-rebirth process impacting the entire human family. Just as an individual can undergo an intense death–rebirth process in spiritual or psychedelic practice, history was putting the entire human family through such a process.",

Could you elaborate?\nChris Bache: I explore this in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human,” and earlier in “The Great Awakening” in Dark Night, Early Dawn (2000). I was uncomfortable entering this territory at first—I’m not drawn to historical speculation. I began this work for individual healing and enlightenment, and that premise was blown away within a few years. The purification, the access to information and knowledge—everything seemed to be in service of the species as a whole. It’s not that our species is special in the universe, but the Divine’s focus here, now, seems species-wide.\n\nThis emphasis repeated so often and strongly that the gist of my 20-year journey became the collective story of death and rebirth. I have deep convictions that we’ve entered the dark night of our collective soul—a period of purification, confronting the sins of our fathers and mothers, which are our own through reincarnation. We’re facing our past choices and their consequences, purifying the toxins they left, to open into new dimensions of our being.",

I don’t know how long this transition will take—at least generations. Whether it’s 100 years or several hundred, I don’t know. If it took 1,000 years, that’s probably stretching it, because I think we’ll be dead if we don’t make this transition sooner. We’re either going to go extinct or we’re going to transition into this new form. Extinction—or near extinction—is a tremendous accelerator of evolution. However long it takes, whatever we become, evolution isn’t going to stop. We’ve been at this for billions of years; we’ll be at this for billions more. There’s no telling where we might go next, and next after that. So I don’t see an end point—just the next point. And the next point is to wake up to what’s really going on, to who we really are, to the depth and breadth of our relationships with life itself, other people, and other species—and then we continue.\n\nSandy Sedgbeer:\nIt’s been 24 years since you stopped.

Whatever transformation we’re going through—and we agree it’s acute, giving birth to a new order of human capacity—however long it takes, the human story isn’t stopping. The evolutionary drama isn’t ending. This is a new platform within which the story will continue to develop. We’ve been evolving by learning from suffering, our great teacher in much of the past, but we’re getting past that—just as we’re growing out of our fear of death. If there were one thing I wish I could give people from my sessions, it would be to lose the fear of death. If you’re afraid of death, your cosmology is upside down.

As we transition into questions and answers, I want to share a view I think we both hold: this century is a century of labor. We have been gestating the future human for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years through reincarnation—over and over, deeper and deeper. But now we’ve come into labor. Gestation is long; labor is short. Gestation can be gentle while life goes on at the surface; labor is intense. It requires a complete interruption of ordinary life and a deep turning within. We are in the process of collectively giving birth to what I call the future human. Many have seen and felt it—Homo spiritualis, Homo noeticus, different names—but the fundamental idea is the same: we are giving birth to a more evolved form of humanity.",

It’s going to require our very, very best and deepest efforts to come through this changed and built better.\n\nRoger Walsh:\nSo your vision may not be, “This is the way it’s going to be,” but rather, “Here is the possibility to which we can open ourselves.”\n\nChris Bache:\nYes, and I have to acknowledge that. Sometimes people who nearly die have, as part of their life review, a life preview. Sometimes what they see of the future comes true, and sometimes they see a future they can change. I talk about this in Ken Ring’s work, Heading Toward Omega. If they’re seeing a future they can change, they’re seeing a conditional future, not an absolute preset future. So what I’m seeing is a possible future—maybe even a probable future—but still a future we have to enact.",

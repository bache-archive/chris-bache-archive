This conversation is a follow-up. It was intended to be a discussion of various themes in the book, but it quickly focused on one particular aspect: while Chris was having experiences of deep time—like experiencing the entire course of human existence as a singular moment—he had a vision of what he called the birth of the future human, emerging out of extreme cataclysm: a long phase of strife, grief, suffering, and challenges that push humanity into its next phase of evolution. Chris considers where we are now to be the start of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>eally look forward to sharing the experiences I report in my book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe.
David has framed our conversation as the question of whether we can all access the cosmic mind using psychedelics. I believe that we all can, but whether we all should is another matter entirely. In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.</p>
<p>In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves. What’s important is the vision of the cosmos they contain, and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point we’re coming to.</p>

<p>lly important for humanity to address are being denied. First and foremost is global climate change.
In my book, LSD in the Mind of the Universe, I have a chapter on what I call the birth of the future human. It summarizes transmissions given to me over a 20-year course of high-dose LSD sessions about humanity's future, where we are in our evolutionary development, the critical crisis we are moving into, and the birth of a new form of humanity coming out of that crisis. A great future for humanity is possible, but for deep, spiritual realization to emerge, there must first take place a collective dark night of the soul. So I see what's happening politically against that backdrop: a growing dismantling of assumptions, an unraveling of our social contracts, and a growing global crisis generated by a series of eco-crises.</p>

<p>ve the form that the future human will take will be the diamond soul." That gives you a springboard.
Chris Bache: Let me just back up a second. When you work with high doses of LSD, totally internalized and intensified with music and eye shades, you basically explode your consciousness—you shatter it. For six or eight hours at a time, you become a different kind of being. You're not a human being; you open yourself to an unprecedented intimacy with the universe, which takes the role of teacher. The universe decides where you go and what you learn, balancing what you can take in and what it wants you to take in.</p>

<p>names—but the fundamental idea is the same: we are giving birth to a more evolved form of humanity.
What might this future human look like? Here I return to reincarnation and some experiences I describe in LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I’d done past-life therapy before and was familiar with about a dozen former lives—nothing special, ordinary lives. But in one particular session, all my former lives began to come back into me, fast and furious. I’d already gone through tremendous purification and death-rebirth. Then these lives started wrapping into me like filaments of light around a kite spool—each wrap a life. At a certain point they hit critical mass. There was an explosion of energy—diamond light blew out my chest—catapulting me into a completely new state of consciousness. All those individual lives fused into one, into a singularity. Then a teaching unfolded, illuminating the experience.</p>

<p>on, deep meditation, or psychedelic journeying. Feel free to share some of your experiences in that.
Chris Bache: Well, I’ve done that as carefully as I can in my book, LSD in the Mind of the Universe. The invitation is to appreciate that we only became conscious of the Mother Universe about 5,000 years ago—when we developed sufficient discipline to drop beneath the conditioning of our individual egoic mind and tap into the stream of consciousness we share with all life. We’ve been walking upright for 5.8 million years, operating with our larger brain for about 200,000 years. Writing came in about 5,000 years ago; the Upanishadic breakthroughs, three to four thousand years ago. But these are nothing compared to the billions of years ahead. We’re just waking up to who we are, so naturally we get confused given the enormity of what we’re growing into.</p>

<p>osophy of religion, not just for psychology, and I knew I wanted to get involved in doing this work.
So even though LSD had been made illegal in 1970, I chose to conscientiously break the law and begin a series of rigorously structured sessions following Stan’s protocol. After three medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at high doses. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. I would be much gentler on myself if I were doing it over again, but at the time this is what I was doing to accelerate my own spiritual development. Quickly it evolved into engaging the deep structures of human evolution and trying to support humanity’s spiritual development, and then exploring this marvelous universe that we are part of.</p>

You write toward the beginning of the book, “In the end, what’s important is not the method of exploration used, but what this method shows us about the extraordinary universe we live in.” That’s what I want to focus on—really the discoveries that you made. Let’s start with the title: LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I’m not sure everyone can track with you there—the universe has a mind? Tell us what you discovered.</p>

There is a third segment on the birth of the future human that came later in the chapter on the final vision. My visions didn’t tell me how or when this would take place, nor details. They took me inside the collective psyche and gave me its experience of the transition, and an understanding of some of the mechanisms at the collective level that will help us make this huge transition in the little time we have. I discuss this in Dark Night, Early Dawn and again in LSD and the Mind of the Universe.</p>

<p>incredible LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven, which many people have read now.
Just to add a little more about how I understand what happened in that 20-year journey—mind you, it would take all day to do it justice—the very short version is: in each one of those 73 journeys, the first two hours were, as you described in the book, sometimes exquisitely painful as you went through the difficult process of ego dissolution and beyond—letting go of any kind of identity, even as a human. And then what happened, as I recall, is that you broke out into what you have called the vast intelligences of the universe. Believe me, folks, this is no exaggeration—the kind of material that Chris brought back is absolutely stunning and absolutely relevant to what’s going on on the planet.</p>

As a long-time social activist, I want to add another note before we conclude. There are no guarantees here. We’ve seen the possibilities and felt them in our souls and bones. We know what’s possible, but there’s no guarantee we’ll realize it as a species. I see three great possibilities ahead. One is what we’ve just been speaking about: an extraordinary invitation into greater aliveness and possibility.</p>

<p>Chris Bache:
And eventually you come out with a certain understanding, at least of the large structure—the nature of reality. We're not simply creating a new society or a better society or a new economy or a new ecology. We are actually giving birth to a new form of the human species. I never expected anything like this to emerge in the work. I didn't know this was even possible. At the subtle level of consciousness, you open up to different levels of collective consciousness, and when your individual identity pops, you can open to your species identity, to the collective psyche. I’ve had that experience many times.</p>

<p>the LSD work—but LSD and the Mind of the Universe focuses on what happened in the high-dose journey.
The circumstances were unusually stable, concentrated, and focused: the same sitter for years, same set and setting, intention, location (Northeast Ohio), substance, dose level, and the same recording process—always recording each session as completely as possible within 24 hours. When you stabilize your work—eliminate variables, use the same methodology consistently—it stabilizes the conversation between you and the creative intelligence of the universe. It stabilizes the communion so that one session leads to the next in a coherent, intelligent manner. You may not understand the continuity as it unfolds, but over time you see patterns and feel you’re engaging a single creative intelligence. I say that carefully—there are many layers and forms of intelligence—but across sessions the continuity is unmistakable.</p>

<p>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is the memoir of a psychedelic explorer. It is the story of one person’s journey into the mind of the cosmos. I’ve tried to tell this story as concisely as I can, focusing on the journey itself and keeping theoretical discussion to a minimum. I will rely on other authors to give the reader the history and science of psychedelics, their psychopharmacology, and their clinical applications. I share my psychedelic experiences here not because I think they are special or unique, for they are not, but because, all things considered, they are the most valuable gift I have to offer the psychedelic conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the first time that the theme of humanity’s future entered my sessions, but it would not be the last. From this point on, the story of our collective evolution became a recurring theme in my work. Though I describe this story as a “master plan,” I do not mean this in a heavy handed, dictated-destiny sense of the phrase. I am simply trying to give voice to an encounter with the deep intentionality expressing itself in the unfolding complexity of our universe. In time this story became the metaframework of my entire psychedelic journey and my entire life. I will say more about this in chapter 9, “The Birth of the Future Human,” but the story I will tell there began here, inside these two sessions.</p>

<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶49 (8 · 1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the final analysis, I think that whether we remain inside the physical universe after waking up spiritually or leave it behind are not mutually exclusive options but simultaneous possibilities. If we were to achieve enlightenment and leave spacetime for one hundred thousand years and then return, we would find the universe continuing to patiently grow her children through the steady and relentless accumulation of experience in rebirth. If we leave again, this time for a million years, upon our return we would find the same thing—Nature growing humanity into ever richer forms. In such a universe, how could life not eventually produce fully awakened Souls on Earth? Not just a few here and there, but everyone everywhere. An entire species that through its hard labor has given birth to its next self-expression—a fully conscious Soul, green to its roots, feet firmly planted on the Earth but now transparent to the Creative Intelligence that everywhere presses in upon it. This is the vision of history I now turn to explore.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §4 ¶1 (9 · 4)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If history or nature or the Creative Intelligence of the universe is giving birth to a new form of human consciousness on this planet, the next question becomes, What form will this Future Human take? What will our evolutionary future self look like? To address this question, I want to connect the vision of the Great Awakening presented here with the vision of the birth of the Diamond Soul presented in the previous chapter. There is such a striking convergence of themes in these two visions that the longer I have held them both in my awareness, the more I have come to see them as deeply intertwined. I offer the following thoughts as a brief explanation for why I believe the form that the Future Human will take will be the Diamond Soul.</p>

<p>The time frame within which all this was taking place was staggering. In a final and deeply moving portion of the session, I entered humanity's deep future again and spent time with the FORM of the being we are becoming—the Future Human. What a splendid creature! What grace and nobility! It was such a privilege to experience this being and so helpful as we enter the difficult years ahead. The people need a vision of what we are becoming—of the extraordinary beauty that is emerging from our tangled past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §3 ¶13 (9 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the inherent wholeness of existence becomes a living experience for more and more persons, individuals will find themselves empowered by new orders of creativity that could not have been anticipated as long as we were trapped within the narrow confines of an atomistic, self-referential mode of consciousness. As the encompassing fields of mind become stronger, synergy and synchronicity will increase. The Sacred Mind will spring alive inside the human family in ways that seem impossible from our current fragmented condition. However difficult the journey, who could not feel uplifted by the privilege of being part of such an undertaking? The pain of this labor should not be feared but used creatively. We are building a new world for our grandchildren, indeed, a new species. (Bache 2000, 254-56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶9 (9 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know it sounds arrogant to speak on such a scale, but I must if lam to describe the visions that repeatedly came through my sessions. Ego-death destroys the existential isolation and constant self-referencing that organizes our ordinary experience of the world. When the partitions of personal consciousness are surrendered, our experience spontaneously opens to the larger rhythms of life that we are part of. One portion of these rhythms is the collective psyche of our species. At the subtle level of consciousness, we can dissolve into the human species-mind so deeply that the beginnings and endings of our personal life become insignificant. When the “small-self” opens to the “species-self” this completely, it is only natural that insights into humanity’s larger developmental trajectory sometimes emerge in our awareness. We would be surprised if this did not happen.</p>

<p>ts for the natural human being, the birth of the future human. What does the future human look like?
Chris Bache:
I think our spiritual traditions have been giving us insights into what’s emerging. All of the great saints and sages who seeded the religions of the Axial Age drew humanity to them because we could feel a deep resonance. They were archetypal prototypes of what we were becoming, and they invited us to become what they had become. In the Buddhas, the prophets, the Christ, and the great saints of the deepest spiritual traditions, we can see prototypes of what’s coming.</p>

<p>:
I recall in your book that you were shown the universe goes on and on, essentially. Is that right?
Chris Bache:
There are two different models: one is that it’ll keep expanding forever; the other is that it reaches a maximum expansion and then contracts—a pulsating universe expanding and contracting, then re-expanding. I don’t have an answer to that question. Clearly, the universe is on a tear, going on for billions and billions of years. That’s a deflating insight if you think a human being is simply a 100-year-old being; then we’re sand on the beach beside the ocean—we don’t get to participate in that deep future. But if reincarnation is true—and I think there’s plenty of factual evidence that it is—and if our essence is indestructible, and we roll over what we’ve learned into continued learning over thousands and millions of years, then we actually get to participate in this divine unfolding. It’s our future. We are co-participants—eternal participants—in this eternal process.</p>

Chris Bache:
There’s a chapter in the book called “The Birth of the Future Human.” I think it may be the most important chapter, and it completely surprised me. I thought my work was a personal journey—healing, awakening. Then it broadened into an individual’s insight into the deep structure of our lives. But starting around 1990 through 1995, I began receiving a series of internally consistent visions about humanity’s evolutionary destiny: where we were in our journey, that we were coming to a turning point, a crescendo that would catalyze a tremendous transformation inside humanity—a true before-and-after moment in time. A profound spiritual transformation was coming to a head. This kept repeating itself in my work in different ways, but I didn’t know how the universe was going to pull it off.</p>

One of the last great visions the universe gave me in one of my sessions took me deep into deep time—into the future—and gave me my last experience of the future human. It was as if it allowed me to try on, for size, the fundamental blueprint of the human psyche at that point in the future. This was the most extraordinary being. I can't quickly describe to you what an extraordinary being this is.</p>

Chris Bache: We're trying to unify engineering, ecological, industrial practices; taking responsibility for planetary health geopolitically and geophysically. That effort is mirrored by the intrapsychic process where we strive to grow up and come to terms with who and what we are. This is what I call the birth of the future human. The crisis we are entering, which will likely dominate the 21st and extend into the 22nd century, is not simply economic or industrial—it's a crisis of consciousness, an evolutionary crisis giving birth to a future human.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ng been through what you’ve been through, how do you see these times laid into what you experienced?
Chris Bache:
Jumping many years ahead, I summarized my experiences of our time in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human.” Over many years, I was given visions of humanity coming to a turning point, a spiritual breakthrough—an evolutionary shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. In 1995, I dissolved into the species mind, into what I call deep time, taken into the future where I experienced a death-and-rebirth of the human family—not as individuals, but humanity as a whole. It was a global systems crisis precipitated by escalating ecological crises. I wasn’t given details, dates, nothing about artificial intelligence or a third world war—just the experience of a prolonged loss of control and a collapse of everything considered normal and necessary. Since then, I’ve lived with this awareness. For me, it’s not a projected fantasy; it’s an experience, so I don’t question its truth. I see this period as one of increasing destabilization: conflicts between races, religions, sexes, classes—tremendous things we’ve done to each other for thousands of years. We have to grow spiritually into the next form emerging in the human. I think this process will continue to deepen for decades. What’s unfolding now is the overture, bringing to the surface age-old hatreds that we must transform. I don’t offer political solutions; my perspective isn’t ground-level. It’s from far above the Earth, looking at the long evolutionary trajectory.</p>

<p>vehicle—the human being—is designed for rapid transformation. Please expand on that before we close.
Chris Bache:
In the 70th vision, I was given what I consider the last great vision of my journey; after that, it was wrapping up. I was taken into deep time and shown three core experiences. One was an insight into how humanity is designed for accelerated evolution. On the surface, we reincarnate: we learn, grow, change, make decisions, and return different. But beneath the incarnating self is a deeper structure that holds all our incarnational memories—a fundamental blueprint from which we act. Humanity grows and changes individually, while a very specific structure in the collective psyche accumulates and stores that information. Periodically, that deeper structure pivots—what I call a shift in the plate tectonics of the collective psyche. It’s the genius of creation: we learn individually, it collects at a deeper level, and when that deeper level shifts, all subsequent individual experience unfolds from that changed fundamental psyche. After the birth of the future human, all future incarnations of human beings will operate out of this transformed collective psyche—and the process continues. Individuals learn and grow; it’s collected at depth; that level learns and grows—like Rupert Sheldrake talks about morphogenic fields—an ongoing, continuously evolving process.</p>

Can you say more about the visions you had for humanity’s future and the time that we’re in?
Chris Bache:
This was one of the great surprises for me, because I never expected anything like this to emerge in my work. I thought it was about personal transformation, even personal enlightenment. I never imagined that the evolution of the species would become such a dominant theme. Going back to about halfway through the work in the early ’90s, starting in 1991, I began to have a series of visions—just dropped into my sessions—that humanity was coming to a turning point, a true before-and-after point in history. We were entering a time of intense purification, essentially purifying the human psyche of the sins of our fathers—lifting the conditioning of the past to make us more receptive to, and capable of internalizing, the spiritual infusion, insights, and power becoming available at this time in history. There was a tremendous sense of rebirth coming.</p>

Chris Bache:
I know I’m sharing my own visionary experiences. What may be powerful and true for one person won’t necessarily be powerful or true for another. I can only share what my experience has been. Early on—starting around my 23rd session, so for the last 50 or so—one of the recurring themes was where humanity is going. The vision was repeated again and again: we are coming into a turning point in history, a decisive before-and-after point, poised on the edge of a magnificent transition into a higher level of functioning. There is a greatness emerging within humanity.</p>

Now—or for a long time before that, within our time before that.</p>

<p>Chris Bache:
There’s another theme that gave me some details of what the future human is. In other sessions, I was taken far into the future and experienced this new archetype. I believe in reincarnation—my first book was on reincarnation—and from a philosopher’s perspective, I think the empirical evidence is overwhelming. It’s always been part of my thinking, based on the evidence, not religious belief. I experienced reincarnation dynamics many times in my sessions—not only my personal reincarnational history, but reincarnation as a dynamic process for the entire planet. The entire species is pulsing in the rhythm of reincarnation. If reincarnation is a basic fact of life, then we have been building the future human for hundreds of thousands of years, growing bit by bit. We remember our former lives usually when we die and return to the domain of the soul, but I think we are coming into a point where the soul is becoming conscious inside our historical existence.</p>

<p>lly conscious souls; that species would create a different life on this planet than we’ve ever seen.
Later in my work, over about four years, I began receiving a series of visions about human evolution. The message was always the same: we’re coming to a turning point, a profound spiritual awakening—a before-and-after in human history. It involves tremendous collective purification, emptying out the pains of history to lay a new foundation for an infusion of divine energy rising within us. I was given glimpses of the transformed humanity that would emerge, but not how nature would pull it off.</p>

<p>Several years later, in 1995, when I had transitioned to the Diamond Luminosity phase of my work, I expected to be taken back into that state. Instead, I was dissolved into the species—Chris Bache dissolved into the human family. As the human family, I was taken into the future—into deep time—and experienced what I came to understand as a death-and-rebirth process impacting the entire human family. Just as an individual can undergo an intense death–rebirth process in spiritual or psychedelic practice, history was putting the entire human family through such a process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>e case: a painful birth to transition into a more functional, balanced species. Could you elaborate?
Chris Bache: I explore this in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human,” and earlier in “The Great Awakening” in Dark Night, Early Dawn (2000). I was uncomfortable entering this territory at first—I’m not drawn to historical speculation. I began this work for individual healing and enlightenment, and that premise was blown away within a few years. The purification, the access to information and knowledge—everything seemed to be in service of the species as a whole. It’s not that our species is special in the universe, but the Divine’s focus here, now, seems species-wide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This emphasis repeated so often and strongly that the gist of my 20-year journey became the collective story of death and rebirth. I have deep convictions that we’ve entered the dark night of our collective soul—a period of purification, confronting the sins of our fathers and mothers, which are our own through reincarnation. We’re facing our past choices and their consequences, purifying the toxins they left, to open into new dimensions of our being.</p>

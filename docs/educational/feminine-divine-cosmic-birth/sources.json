First, the tremendous love the universe awakened in me—the deep heart-opening and passionate love that took me in—had a feminine quality. Second, a specific cosmology emerged in my sessions that surprised me; it wasn’t one I’d internalized from my reading. I was taken back to the beginning of creation—before the Big Bang—and experienced the universe emerging out of a primal oneness which becomes two, yin and yang. Out of that primal two, one consciousness remained outside time and space, intact, while the other entered time and space and manifested everything that has evolved since the Big Bang. The consciousness that stayed outside felt more “masculine,” and the consciousness that created felt more “feminine.” It was congruent with my repeated experience of the universe as more feminine than masculine. The Great Mother lineage is very strong in me; I’ve always felt deeply connected to it.\n\nJef Baker: As in many cultures around the world, the Earth is the Great Mother.",

What I’m about to describe is a heuristic: a splitting of the divine principle into two halves—a “male” half that stays outside time and space in a transcendent position, and a “female” half that manifests time and space and the physical cosmos. I don’t literally think in male/female terms, but this is the best my mind could do. The principle is what matters: not all creative intelligence manifests as physical reality. Some holds position outside physical reality. There is a spiritual reality that gives birth to physical reality.",

That also is many thousands of years…\nChris Bache: I think basically all the axial religions got two things fundamentally wrong. They got nature wrong—they don’t really have an adequate theology or understanding of nature—and they got women wrong. The two are connected, because women are so closely connected to nature, and those traditions were patriarchally and escapist oriented. As a historian, I understand it. Four or five thousand years ago, through various psychotechnologies—yoga, meditation, or psychedelic substances—we began to have deeper experiences of the Mother Universe, the universe that surrounds the physical universe. Once you have experiential contact with that universe, it is so blissful, so ecstatic, and you recognize that’s where we’re from. You can’t help believing that’s where we belong. This is not where we belong; that is where we belong. So a theology of return developed: the savior comes to take us home, the enlightened being liberates us back into our home. But that still leaves the question: what is the purpose of creation?",

The mother universe is spiritual reality, continually infusing, orchestrating, shaping, and receiving physical reality. At the subatomic level there’s a dance, a continual infusion of energy into time and space from the quantum or sub-quantum realm. Ninety-six percent of the universe is dark energy and dark matter—physical existence is just the surface.",

Perhaps you could give us a little insight into the nature of deep time.\n\nChris Bache: Early on, after the ocean of suffering in the cleansing phase—really intense collective cleansing—when I came through each session, I’d be spun into a reality so foreign that, after my 11th session, I couldn’t remember it. It took months to begin to fully recall it. I had entered what I later called “deep time.” For a year and a total of seven sessions, I experienced my life as a completed whole—start to finish—with all the days of my life simultaneously present. Holding the totality of my life in a single now was hard for a mind trained to operate linearly. It literally took a year to learn to stabilize consciousness at that condition. I kept going back to the same state; the universe was teaching me how to be conscious there.",

Around my ninth or tenth session, the universe broke me like a twig. I began the day as a white, Ivy League–educated philosopher, passionately concerned with the meaning of existence. The universe forced me to become its exact opposite. I became women. I became women of color. I became women who weren’t interested in the meaning of life, who weren’t educated at all. I was myself, but in all these other roles. It terrified me. I fought it. Eventually, when I surrendered and allowed myself to become all these women, everything shifted. I was taken under the arm of the Great Mother and initiated into the lives of hundreds of women—the more positive side of female experience—conceiving, giving birth, loving husbands, loving children.",

I see myself as a servant of the Great Mother, with physical existence as her embodiment and the transcendent divine as more male, the embodied divine more female.

It was a womanly form that was the exact opposite of my male, academic, intellectually oriented form. It was totally terrifying to experience being me but not being me within a framework I’d never known. It snapped me. When I let go and yielded, I became hundreds—potentially thousands—of women and was given a journey into the world of women under the arm of the Great Mother. It was ecstatic. When it opened, I thought, Why was I afraid of this? This is marvelous. The universe was teaching me that where I was going, gender does not exist. All gender, all roles based on gender, and any aspect of my historical personality had to be surrendered if I was going to experience more intimately what is there.\n\nRegina Meredith:\nOn behalf of the men and women watching this: what was the most terrifying or difficult part initially of being confronted with a woman’s reality?",

I thought my work was a personal journey—healing, awakening. Then it broadened into an individual’s insight into the deep structure of our lives. But starting around 1990 through 1995, I began receiving a series of internally consistent visions about humanity’s evolutionary destiny: where we were in our journey, that we were coming to a turning point, a crescendo that would catalyze a tremendous transformation inside humanity—a true before-and-after moment in time. A profound spiritual transformation was coming to a head. This kept repeating itself in my work in different ways, but I didn’t know how the universe was going to pull it off.",

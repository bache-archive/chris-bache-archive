*Bache’s “cosmic birth” frames creation as a feminine descent into time/space and a coming reunion—labor that births a more transparent humanity.*

## Curated weave (book-first)

> Creation seemed to be a reality that had come forth from a dynamic relation between two Cosmic Beings […] One being, who felt more like a “She,” had plunged Herself into the task of creating space-time […] The other being, who felt more like a “He,” had remained fully conscious outside of space-time. […] With this phase of the work now largely complete, the self-imposed exile was coming to an end, and the Lovers were at long last being reunited.  
— **LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶121**

In Bache’s sessions, creation is a love-driven polarity within a prior unity. The “She” becomes the universe by entering time and space, losing conscious memory for aeons; the “He” remains transcendent. As evolution ripens, the long separation closes—*a reunion that functions as a cosmic birth*.

> When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level […] it allows a *cosmic communion* to take place between the causal and subtle realms. […] What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God […].  
— **LSDMU App. I §1 ¶22**

This birth unfolds through communion across levels—subtle and causal interpenetrating—so the “below” remembers the “above.” The process is not merely personal but ontological: reality nourishing itself through us.

> With this insight, an exquisite joy swept through me. I suddenly remembered what I was. […] my identity was […] the Divine Feminine who had set out to create the physical universe and who was now being reunited with her Lover. […] My nature was Consciousness and my work was Creation. All for joy.  
— **LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶28**

Bache’s identity experiences confirm the pattern: the labor of separation, the reunion, and the joy of creation realized. The “Womb of Creation” then reframes human evolution within a vaster cosmology.

> *The Womb of Creation* placed the master story of human evolution into a larger cosmological context […].  
— **LSDMU ch.11 §1 ¶19**

A few public talks tie this to our historical moment: a species-level turning—“the future human”—arriving as the feminine reconciles with the masculine.

> I want to be careful […] a splitting of the divine principle into two halves—a “male” half that stays outside time and space […] and a “female” half that manifests time and space and the physical cosmos. […] The principle is what matters […].

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶121**  
> Creation seemed to be a reality that had come forth from a dynamic relation between two Cosmic Beings who had themselves emerged from a Primal Unity. One being, who felt more like a “She,” had plunged Herself into the task of creating space-time and the physical universe, knowing in advance that She would eventually lose Her self-awareness in this work and become unconscious of Her true nature for billions of years. The other being, who felt more like a “He,” had remained fully conscious outside of space-time. The creating half had voluntarily submitted to this long and painful isolation in order to create the raw substance of the physical universe, which would in time become transparent to divine intention as matter evolved into increasing self-awareness. With this phase of the work now largely complete, the self-imposed exile was coming to an end, and the Lovers were at long last being reunited.

**LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶28**  
> With this insight, an exquisite joy swept through me. I suddenly remembered what I was. At that moment, my identity was not Chris Bache but the Divine Feminine who had set out to create the physical universe and who was now being reunited with her Lover. Through these many glimpses, I had been patiently guided to rediscover my true nature and the purpose of my life. My nature was Consciousness and my work was Creation. All for joy.

**LSDMU App. I §1 ¶22**  
> Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a *cosmic communion* to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.

**LSDMU ch.11 §1 ¶19**  
> *The Womb of Creation* placed the master story of human evolution into a larger cosmological context. It was as though the consciousness guiding my sessions wanted to lift my line of sight to a broader horizon at the end of the journey and give me a higher vantage point from which to view everything taking place on our planet in order to remind me that as meaningful and beautiful as the entire evolutionary project is, it is but one drop in the infinite ocean of being.

**LSDMU App. I §1 ¶21**  
> Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book *The Cosmic Game*. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.

> I want to be careful and remind us that a finite mind does its best to give cognitive structure to transcendent experiences. What I’m about to describe is a heuristic: a splitting of the divine principle into two halves—a “male” half that stays outside time and space in a transcendent position, and a “female” half that manifests time and space and the physical cosmos. I don’t literally think in male/female terms, but this is the best my mind could do. The principle is what matters: not all creative intelligence manifests as physical reality. Some holds position outside physical reality. There is a spiritual reality that gives birth to physical reality.

> That was my ego death experience. […] When I let go and yielded, I became hundreds—potentially thousands—of women and was given a journey into the world of women under the arm of the Great Mother. It was ecstatic. […] The universe was teaching me that where I was going, gender does not exist.

## Notes & synthesis

The book anchors the “cosmic birth” in a two-in-one cosmology (ch.6), with experiential confirmation (ch.6 ¶28) and a mechanism of inter-level communion (App. I §1). Talks clarify the gendered language as heuristic, tie the reunion to a species-level transformation, and frame the work as service to the Great Mother. No direct contradictions surfaced.

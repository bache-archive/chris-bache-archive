<blockquote>
<p>Christopher M. Bache is a scholar whose work explores the intersection of consciousness, cosmology, and spirituality, particularly through the lens of psychedelic experiences. His writings delve into the nature of the universe, emphasizing a feminine aspect of creation and the interconnectedness of all existence. Bache's approach combines philosophical inquiry with insights drawn from personal exploration, contributing to a broader understanding of the divine and the cosmos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creation seemed to be a reality that had come forth from a dynamic relation between two Cosmic Beings who had themselves emerged from a Primal Unity. One being, who felt more like a “She,” had plunged Herself into the task of creating space-time and the physical universe, knowing in advance that She would eventually lose Her self-awareness in this work and become unconscious of Her true nature for billions of years. The other being, who felt more like a “He,” had remained fully conscious outside of space-time. The creating half had voluntarily submitted to this long and painful isolation in order to create the raw substance of the physical universe, which would in time become transparent to divine intention as matter evolved into increasing self-awareness. With this phase of the work now largely complete, the self-imposed exile was coming to an end, and the Lovers were at long last being reunited.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book <em>The Cosmic Game</em>. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶22 (1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a <em>cosmic communion</em> to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.</p>

<p>Light has always been recognized as a signature of the Divine. It is a universal constant in our spiritual traditions—a vast radiance fusing all knowledge, love, and power. Mystics attest to it; those who have nearly died attest to it. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that when our psychedelic journey takes us deep into the universe, the Light is waiting for us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the negative perinatal experiences continued to build over the next several sessions, so did the positive experiences that emerged during the ecstatic portion of the sessions. In one session, I experienced life as a living fabric of interwoven intelligences—atomic, molecular, cellular, human, societal, and planetary. This early taste of the weave of Oneness was just a metaphysical appetizer for the deeper experiences of Oneness that would follow later, so I will not spend time on it. I would, however, like to share one experience from this period because it speaks to the rationale for this book as a whole. This session helped me let go of my conventional academic training and embrace psychedelics as anew method of philosophical inquiry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶6 (1 · 5)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As this journey deepened, I found myself entering a spiraling love affair with this intelligence, a Being so vast I can only describe it using the vocabulary of the Divine even while the sessions themselves were repeatedly demonstrating how limited and childlike our historical conceptions of the Divine have been. I agree with Jonathan Goldman who in speaking of ayahuasca said, “The rituals of the Daime are not meant to be an ‘experience,’ but rather to provide a chance to interact intimately with a Divine Being of unimaginable intelligence, compassion, clarity, and spiritual power.’ I do not know the limits of this Being and I hesitate to even call it a “Being” at all. As I have experienced it, it is the fabric of existence itself. I think of it as the generative intelligence of our universe, the Mind of the Cosmos—both transcendent source and manifest body of existence, beyond all categories of He or She yet infinitely more than any It.</p>

<p>When a subject in a psychedelic session engages a perinatal matrix, then the experience will be multidimensional but thematically coherent. He or she may experience simultaneously one or more phases of the original birth trauma, similar real or imagined traumas from later life of both a physical and psychological nature, and, in addition, thematically congruent spiritual and philosophical conflicts and insights....</p>

<p>With this insight, an exquisite joy swept through me. I suddenly remembered what I was. At that moment, my identity was not Chris Bache but the Divine Feminine who had set out to create the physical universe and who was now being reunited with her Lover. Through these many glimpses, I had been patiently guided to rediscover my true nature and the purpose of my life. My nature was Consciousness and my work was Creation. All for joy.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the inherent wholeness of existence becomes a living experience for more and more persons, individuals will find themselves empowered by new orders of creativity that could not have been anticipated as long as we were trapped within the narrow confines of an atomistic, self-referential mode of consciousness. As the encompassing fields of mind become stronger, synergy and synchronicity will increase. The Sacred Mind will spring alive inside the human family in ways that seem impossible from our current fragmented condition. However difficult the journey, who could not feel uplifted by the privilege of being part of such an undertaking? The pain of this labor should not be feared but used creatively. We are building a new world for our grandchildren, indeed, a new species. (Bache 2000, 254-56)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The Womb of Creation</em> placed the master story of human evolution into a larger cosmological context. It was as though the consciousness guiding my sessions wanted to lift my line of sight to a broader horizon at the end of the journey and give me a higher vantage point from which to view everything taking place on our planet in order to remind me that as meaningful and beautiful as the entire evolutionary project is, it is but one drop in the infinite ocean of being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §11 ¶2 (1 · 11)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that Sri Aurobindo was correct when he said that these cosmologies reflect an incomplete understanding of existence. They reflect the deepening of humanity’s contact with the spiritual universe that took place about three to four thousand years ago. Once we began to gain <em>experiential</em> access to the bliss of this mother universe through meditation, yoga, and psychedelic substances, how could we not but conclude that we “belonged” there more than here, that Earth was not our “true home,” and that we had “fallen” from paradise through some kind of cosmic blunder? Our enthusiasm for these theologies of return is understandable given their historical context, but in the context of the dramatically expanded understanding of the universe emerging in science combined with our deepening psychedelic experience, we are beginning to see that these theologies reflect an incomplete model of the cosmos.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.</p>

<p>That the universe is the manifest body of a Divine Being of unimaginable intelligence, compassion, clarity, and power, that we are all aspects of this Being, never separated from it for a moment, that we are growing ever more aware of this connection, that physical reality emerges out of Light and returns to Light continuously, that Light is our essential nature and our destiny, that all life moves as One, that reincarnation is true, that there is a deep logic and significance to the circumstances of our lives, that everything we do contributes to the evolution of the whole, that our awareness continues in an ocean of time and a sea of bliss when we die, that we are loved beyond measure and that humanity is driving towards an evolutionary breakthrough that will change us and life on this planet at the deepest level.

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶2 (1 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path that has been well documented by scholars. From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.</p>

<p>Jef Baker: It’s interesting that you also note perceiving the universe as feminine.
Chris Bache: For two reasons I discuss in the book. First, the tremendous love the universe awakened in me—the deep heart-opening and passionate love that took me in—had a feminine quality. Second, a specific cosmology emerged in my sessions that surprised me; it wasn’t one I’d internalized from my reading. I was taken back to the beginning of creation—before the Big Bang—and experienced the universe emerging out of a primal oneness which becomes two, yin and yang. Out of that primal two, one consciousness remained outside time and space, intact, while the other entered time and space and manifested everything that has evolved since the Big Bang. The consciousness that stayed outside felt more “masculine,” and the consciousness that created felt more “feminine.” It was congruent with my repeated experience of the universe as more feminine than masculine. The Great Mother lineage is very strong in me; I’ve always felt deeply connected to it.</p>
<p>Jef Baker: As in many cultures around the world, the Earth is the Great Mother.</p>

<p>of the cosmic process integrating and interpenetrating, liberating each other from their loneliness.
Chris Bache:
I want to be careful and remind us that a finite mind does its best to give cognitive structure to transcendent experiences. What I’m about to describe is a heuristic: a splitting of the divine principle into two halves—a “male” half that stays outside time and space in a transcendent position, and a “female” half that manifests time and space and the physical cosmos. I don’t literally think in male/female terms, but this is the best my mind could do. The principle is what matters: not all creative intelligence manifests as physical reality. Some holds position outside physical reality. There is a spiritual reality that gives birth to physical reality.</p>

I believe in reincarnation—we’ve had lives as men and women—but this wasn’t simply encountering former lives. The message was: where you are going, gender does not exist. Let go. When I let go of my identity as Chris Bache, I entered the beginnings of a deep conversation, a deep communion with the universe. I thought after such a deep ego death my suffering was over and I would be introduced to a banquet of cosmological insights. That’s not what happened at the collective mind level.</p>

<p>ted in that kind of slightly self-denial philosophy, isn’t it? That also is many thousands of years…
Chris Bache: I think basically all the axial religions got two things fundamentally wrong. They got nature wrong—they don’t really have an adequate theology or understanding of nature—and they got women wrong. The two are connected, because women are so closely connected to nature, and those traditions were patriarchally and escapist oriented. As a historian, I understand it. Four or five thousand years ago, through various psychotechnologies—yoga, meditation, or psychedelic substances—we began to have deeper experiences of the Mother Universe, the universe that surrounds the physical universe. Once you have experiential contact with that universe, it is so blissful, so ecstatic, and you recognize that’s where we’re from. You can’t help believing that’s where we belong. This is not where we belong; that is where we belong. So a theology of return developed: the savior comes to take us home, the enlightened being liberates us back into our home. But that still leaves the question: what is the purpose of creation?</p>

<p>g about the Divine, the collective mind, manifesting in matter within the universe. Is that correct?
Chris Bache
Yes. Think of a mother universe and a daughter universe. The mother universe is spiritual reality, continually infusing, orchestrating, shaping, and receiving physical reality. At the subatomic level there’s a dance, a continual infusion of energy into time and space from the quantum or sub-quantum realm. Ninety-six percent of the universe is dark energy and dark matter—physical existence is just the surface.</p>

<p>Jef Baker: As I noted earlier, I’m just up to the point of deep time in your book. Perhaps you could give us a little insight into the nature of deep time.</p>
<p>Chris Bache: Early on, after the ocean of suffering in the cleansing phase—really intense collective cleansing—when I came through each session, I’d be spun into a reality so foreign that, after my 11th session, I couldn’t remember it. It took months to begin to fully recall it. I had entered what I later called “deep time.” For a year and a total of seven sessions, I experienced my life as a completed whole—start to finish—with all the days of my life simultaneously present. Holding the totality of my life in a single now was hard for a mind trained to operate linearly. It literally took a year to learn to stabilize consciousness at that condition. I kept going back to the same state; the universe was teaching me how to be conscious there.</p>

Chris Bache: That was my ego death experience. Around my ninth or tenth session, the universe broke me like a twig. I began the day as a white, Ivy League–educated philosopher, passionately concerned with the meaning of existence. The universe forced me to become its exact opposite. I became women. I became women of color. I became women who weren’t interested in the meaning of life, who weren’t educated at all. I was myself, but in all these other roles. It terrified me. I fought it. Eventually, when I surrendered and allowed myself to become all these women, everything shifted. I was taken under the arm of the Great Mother and initiated into the lives of hundreds of women—the more positive side of female experience—conceiving, giving birth, loving husbands, loving children.</p>

At the end, when I wasn’t sure what to do with all of this, the Mother—my naming of the Absolute tends to run feminine—spoke. I see myself as a servant of the Great Mother, with physical existence as her embodiment and the transcendent divine as more male, the embodied divine more female. She said, “Let them see me as you have seen me. That’s all. They’ll know what to do with it. It will serve them in ways you can’t anticipate. Just let them see me.”</p>

<p>ly, what did that do to you when you suddenly connected with the female experience after being male?
Chris Bache:
About two and a half years into my journey—around sessions 10 or 11—the universe put me into a situation where I could experience nothing except from within a feminine identity. It was a womanly form that was the exact opposite of my male, academic, intellectually oriented form. It was totally terrifying to experience being me but not being me within a framework I’d never known. It snapped me. When I let go and yielded, I became hundreds—potentially thousands—of women and was given a journey into the world of women under the arm of the Great Mother. It was ecstatic. When it opened, I thought, Why was I afraid of this? This is marvelous. The universe was teaching me that where I was going, gender does not exist. All gender, all roles based on gender, and any aspect of my historical personality had to be surrendered if I was going to experience more intimately what is there.</p>

Chris Bache:
There’s a chapter in the book called “The Birth of the Future Human.” I think it may be the most important chapter, and it completely surprised me. I thought my work was a personal journey—healing, awakening. Then it broadened into an individual’s insight into the deep structure of our lives. But starting around 1990 through 1995, I began receiving a series of internally consistent visions about humanity’s evolutionary destiny: where we were in our journey, that we were coming to a turning point, a crescendo that would catalyze a tremendous transformation inside humanity—a true before-and-after moment in time. A profound spiritual transformation was coming to a head. This kept repeating itself in my work in different ways, but I didn’t know how the universe was going to pull it off.</p>

No more ‘up and out’ cosmology, no escapist theologies, no Bardo. The Bardo is in the process of emptying itself—it’s a temporary condition in the evolutionary saga, and as we become more integrated, we no longer need that buffer.

So what dies and is reborn at these deeper cycles of death and rebirth—beyond the ego, beyond the species ego, beyond a series of shamanic personas? I think what dies and is reborn is something of truly cosmic proportions. Some dimension God is calling, some dimension that is extraordinarily vast, surrenders, and in that surrendering awakens more completely to itself.

<p>Sandy Sedgbeer: So the suffering is the gateway.
Chris Bache: It's a byproduct of letting go of being small in order to enter being large, and that’s not always easy. It’s not just letting go of personal identity. Ego death is only the first of many patterns of death and rebirth. At deeper levels, what you let go of is much larger than egoic structures. It’s such a mystery that at the end of the book I included an appendix asking, what dies when you're so far beyond ego death and yet still having sensations of dying and loss of control? What, exactly, is dying?</p>

<p>gs. You said these beings live through humanity, experience through humanity, love through humanity.
Chris Bache:
I’ve had reservations about that particular line, but I kept it in because it’s in my original notes. When the ocean of suffering culminated, it exploded me into a deeper level of consciousness. The distinctive qualities were twofold: it was incredibly ancient—beyond anything I’d imagined—and more real than time and space. I eventually came to understand it as archetypal reality: a level that exists before time and space and contributes fundamental structures to them. The vision is that all reality emerges out of a primal One which starts as a void and manifests as the Big Bang. Between the One and even the Big Bang, there are many gradations—unfoldings of the Divine, though I hesitate to use that word because of its connotations. There are many layers, and lower levels are sourced in the actions of higher levels. I was encountering these—whether to call them beings or principles—vast entities others have experienced too. The best my mind could do to give them form was to see them as galaxies—images borrowed from Hubble and James Webb—though they weren’t galaxies, just that massive in scale. These beings were part of creation, creating time and space and some of the structures within it. Far down the line we have human beings. The insight was that all human existence—and, in fact, all existence—was an expression of the intentions of these deeper cosmological principles and beings. I’m not sure I got all the pieces lined up, but I do think all human experience, male and female, is an aspect of a species intelligence; that species intelligence is an aspect of a planetary intelligence, which is an aspect of a solar-system and galactic intelligence. These deeper intelligences manifest as our lives; they experience the world as we do, experiencing the adventures we are having.</p>

Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.</p>

<p>new spiritual experience and reality as it unfolds. I suppose we’re all participants in creating it.
Chris Bache: The movements you mentioned—neo-paganism and eco-spirituality—I see both as attempting to put nature back into spiritual discourse, which was one of the things lost in the classic patriarchal religions. They’re trying to bring us back to the innate wisdom of nature, a wisdom that runs throughout our consciousness and our bodies, connecting our body consciousness to the body consciousness of Earth. Eco-spirituality is a way of experiencing spirituality that connects us to the planet and to the stars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see this in the resurgence of interest in astrology—not a naive, mechanistic astrology, but the vision that the universe has a pulse to it. The galaxies have a pulse, our solar system has a pulse, and if you know how to read that pulse, you can feel how your body and destiny unfold in rhythm with it. That’s a form of eco-spirituality—solar spirituality, galactic spirituality.</p>

<p>g from that into something else. Could you give a step-by-step of what the early stages looked like?
Chris Bache:
For about the first two years, I worked at what Stan Grof describes as the perinatal level of consciousness—the interface between personal egoic reality in space-time and early transpersonal consciousness. I had many experiences of reliving my own birth, experiences of death and dying, until, after about two and a half years, my personal reality was shattered. I died as the person I had known myself to be and was then reborn into a reality that radically transcended Chris Bache's reality. At that point, I was working deep within the collective unconscious, and the process began again.</p>

<p>orced since first experiencing it in the late 1990s, to the writing of the book, to the present day?
Chris Bache: It hasn't changed one bit. I say in the book that when I had the experience in session 55—the death and rebirth of humanity in 1995—for weeks I walked around like I was walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb went off. I have carried in my being, in my body, a knowing of where we are in history and what's coming.</p>

<p>When I look around, whether I agree with people politically or socially or not, I see heroes. I see every human being here on this planet as having incarnated voluntarily, choosing to be part of this evolutionary pivot. Every person here—even though they may not remember it—has chosen to be here, and this is going to be a very difficult period to incarnate. The beings who are part of the incarnation process are extraordinarily powerful, valuable beings.</p>

Aviv Shahar:
We’ll get further into both the divine reality and the cycles of death and rebirth. But just to pick up where you started—the sense of suffering you described—stepping back, what do you understand to be the significance of suffering in the evolutionary process? Why is suffering part of evolution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Bache:
That really is a core question, isn’t it? It’s deep, and hard to answer without preparing the ground, so I’ll take shortcuts and ask your listeners’ indulgence. During the same period of the cosmic tour—when I was being given a crash course in Cosmology 101—I was taken back to what appeared to be the beginning of creation itself, the beginning of time and space, and I experienced an overwhelming love saturating me. It was a cosmic love. Then I witnessed the birth of space and time and all of evolution taking place inside this love, held and guided by it.</p>

<p>ll give birth to that in us which is more beautiful, more ecstatic, more competent, more plugged in.
I think we truly are becoming a species of buddhas, a species of christs and prophets. These are models that tried to give us early visions of what’s emerging. We couldn’t imagine ordinary human beings reaching that level of excellence. Now we begin to understand—through reincarnation, over and over—slowly we grow into that level of excellence, which is simply transparency to the essential condition in which life is experienced. The irony is we awaken to what has always been happening. It’s always been this way: the universe one; the universe filled with intelligence; we empty of separate self. Somehow we distracted ourselves from it. So we’re waking up to the paradise the universe already is. We’ve just been missing it.</p>

I find your experience and vision so hopeful as we move into ecological and societal crisis. We have about ten minutes—does anyone have a question for Chris?</p>

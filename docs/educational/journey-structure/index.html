    <h2>Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)</h2>
    <div class="stack">
      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §10 ¶1</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story I am telling in this book, therefore, is a story of entering progressively deeper states of consciousness and through these states experiencing progressively deeper levels of reality. Because the universe is holographically integrated, experiences of great depth may open at any point along the way, so I don’t want to make a gospel of linear progression. Many variables influence what emerges in a person’s sessions on any given day. That said, it was my experience that by standardizing as many of these variables as possible, the universe by and large revealed itself in stages. Each of these stages had its distinctive characteristics and dynamics. I think of them as different <em>platforms of experience</em>. On my journey, I was systematically moved from one platform of experience to another over many years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶3</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §7 ¶2</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §0 ¶6</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like Pahnke, many journeyers have reported being flooded with a supernatural radiance after going through ego-death. As one moves into still deeper levels of transpersonal experience, one encounters fields nested within fields of light. Each step beyond matter, beyond the soul, beyond the collective psyche, and beyond archetypal reality takes us deeper into a living ecology of light. Eventually, one discovers that the entire universe floats in an Ocean of Radiance.</p>

<p>When I got to the end of the journey, I looked back and asked how many fundamental platforms of consciousness I had entered. I boiled them down to five: work at the personal level; […] the collective mind; then the archetypal dimension; then oneness or causal consciousness; and finally what I call the diamond luminosity.<br />

<p>It’s not simply opening 73 times to the same interface. There’s a cycle of death and rebirth […] If you work consistently, you go through another death and rebirth into another level. […] I distinguished five broad categories my sessions fell into.<br />

<p>Working with high doses, you completely surrender to the process. […] The strategy is to surrender—let consciousness take you wherever it wants, show you whatever it wants, no matter how inscrutable, painful, or absurd it seems at the time.<br />

<p>I always felt myself engaging—and being engaged by—a larger consciousness. […] What you experience as a guiding intelligence arises at the intersection of your individual mind and the universal mind.<br />

<p>All my sessions were recorded within 24 hours. I had about 400 pages of notes, which I studied, blocked, took apart, reassembled, diagrammed in different ways. It took years to piece together the storyline—and decide what to leave out and what to include.<br />

<p>In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.<br />

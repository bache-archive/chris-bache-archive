        "text": "ugh your journeys, and how might that relate to the lack of one ultimate level and meta-coexistence?\nChris Bache: That’s a big question. I was a religious studies professor. My first vocation was wanting to be a Catholic priest. I was raised Roman Catholic and spent four years in the seminary. The Catholic tradition treated me well; no trauma. Then I did an undergraduate degree in theology at Notre Dame, a master’s in New Testament criticism at Cambridge, and philosophy of religion at Brown. By the time I finished graduate school, I had pretty much studied my way out of religion altogether. I recapitulated the transition from medieval Catholic theology to the scriptural revolution in Protestantism, to the scientific critique of religion in the modern mind. I finished a fairly sophisticated agnostic with very high standards for any conceptualization of something beyond time and space—something approximating God.",

When I would go through, consciousness was waiting for me. I might not understand the logic of the sequence for years—there are things I only began to understand when I wrote the book—but I had enough structure to know there was a logic to the process. I always felt met and engaged—sometimes very consciously, where I would ask questions and it would orchestrate my experience. There was an intelligence meeting me, taking me, educating me, breaking me down, reducing me to dust, taking me further, taking me back, over and over until I understood something—and then it would take me deeper.",

I started this work focused on enlightenment, which is what the Ten Oxherding Pictures are about—awakening to the ever-present condition so that, in the end, you come back to where you were, but with your filters clear and the present luminously there. That was my initial agenda.\n\nBut it was superseded by two other aspects. First, the challenges of our collective enlightenment—our collective evolution. Eventually my personal healing or enlightenment was superseded by responding to the call to support our collective transformation in history. Second, that was superseded by the opportunity to explore the deep structure of the universe itself—a cosmological exploration. You don’t need to explore the universe’s deep structure to awaken to your essential nature. These are different projects. My work combined the enlightenment project but yielded to a different one—the philosopher’s project: an invitation to explore, as far as I could, the nature of cosmic reality.",

I could lift my eye shades mid-journey and not be hallucinating. The visuals were very deep, but I never saw the intelligence I was experiencing so intimately. It would purify me—beat me up, crush me, destroy me—and then, after purification, receive me, educate me, take me through things until it was sure I understood, then take me deeper.

There’s nothing unique about my experiences—they’re part of our collective experiences that push the boundaries in certain ways. Many people have written to say I clarified their experiences—“Here’s what I experienced around this topic.” Many have written, “I’ve never touched psychedelics in my life, but I’ve had experiences completely in alignment with yours. Let me explain mine.” Clearly this is a large pattern emerging within the collective psyche. It’s a joy to share and to enter into conversation with other journeyers.",

I began as a Christian and a Catholic—four years in seminary studying for the priesthood. I studied Hebrew and Greek for biblical work. I’ve learned so much from Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Native traditions. The two deepest, longest-lasting influences on me have been Christianity and Buddhism.\n\nI think my journey affirms the deepest truths of Christianity and of all the world’s religions—Judaism’s Kabbalah, Hinduism, Buddhism—while also, in important ways, eclipsing the religions of the last several thousand years.

And how might someone structure them if they’re aimed at the other goals?\nChris Bache:\nI didn’t understand much of this at the time; I understood it only after going a long way down the road and looking back at how my choices affected the trajectory. The dose decision is significant. Working with high doses, you completely surrender to the process. It’s impossible to direct it. You can set all the good intentions you want, but the states that arise with high doses, amplified by carefully selected music and internalization in a kiva-like practice, set in motion processes so powerful you can’t control them. The strategy is to surrender—let consciousness take you wherever it wants, show you whatever it wants, no matter how inscrutable, painful, or absurd it seems at the time.",

I saw the range of experiences Stan described in Realms of the Human Unconscious. With my grounding in Western philosophical and theological thought, I appreciated the significance of these states. I believed that people making the most important contributions in my discipline would be speaking from an experiential basis in a matter of years, not just a theoretical one. To do that, you have to get in and do the work. I had no idea how long it would be. Early on, I thought you go through ego death and then get unrestricted access to deep consciousness. What I found is the universe has many layers. While it’s all holographically integrated, if you engage systematically with a careful methodology, the universe takes you in by degrees, by layers. As you move into a new layer of consciousness and stabilize there, if you keep pushing, you go to the edge of that layer and through another death-and-rebirth process—different than ego death but building on it. You go through a series of death-and-rebirth processes as you explore progressively deeper levels. That’s how it happened for me. There was a systematic progression into communion with the universe. That’s how I laid out the book: beginning to end, consolidating the story, each chapter moving into another level of consciousness or engagement.",

Could you speak to that?\nChris Bache:\nI always felt myself engaging—and being engaged by—a larger consciousness. It didn’t take concrete, personified form. Its core qualities changed as I went deeper. The way I think of it: the consciousness we enter into in psychedelic states is an infinite consciousness capable of generating any number of experiences. Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from this infinite field.\n\nIf you do this repeatedly, as you integrate experiences and undergo purifications, your consciousness changes. The consciousness you take into the next encounter catalyzes a deeper set of experiences from the infinite potential. What you experience as a guiding intelligence arises at the intersection of your individual mind and the universal mind; as you change, that intersection changes. The guiding consciousness felt constant to me but remained formless, seldom adopting concrete form—because forms would change as the experiences deepened.",

        "text": "you unpick a bit of the structure you see as useful for helping us move toward being future humans?\nChris Bache\nThere are several things rolled into your observations—all good. First, I think integration is very important. We have the chemical technology to trigger very deep states of consciousness, but these states may have very little lasting impact on our deeply ingrained psychological and cultural habits if we don't take time to sit with them and integrate them as deeply as we can into our embodied existence.\n\nOver the course of my work, even though I was paying a lot of attention and doing as good a job as I could to integrate each individual session, I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey. I didn't fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey and realized how hard the stopping hit me, exposing the imbalance—the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences, which were the deepest: being drawn into intimacy, into communion with—I want to say the divine, but I'm cautious because we have to unpack theological baggage.",

When I started, I thought there was just one death—ego death—that would launch you into the spiritual universe. But the spiritual universe has many layers. Being operational at one layer doesn’t mean you’re operational at deeper layers. You go through another metamorphosis—another death and surrender—to be reborn into another layer, and so on. That reflects the Tibetan idea of Bardo: a discrete layer of consciousness. In describing the after-death journey, there are multiple Bardos you pass through—the hungry ghosts, heavenly spirits, and so on. In the West, we often use Bardo to represent the totality of what happens after death, and that’s fine, but the original use points to stages in a progression.",

Depth is different: entering contact with deeper levels of reality—other systems, other beings, archetypal realities, the void, the pure cosmic void.

I boiled them down to five: work at the personal level; work at the collective mind—where the ocean of suffering arose and purification aimed at the collective more than the personal; then the archetypal dimension; then oneness or causal consciousness; and finally what I call the diamond luminosity—what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.",

> the LSD work—but LSD and the Mind of the Universe focuses on what happened in the high-dose journey.
> The circumstances were unusually stable, concentrated, and focused: the same sitter for years, same set and setting, intention, location (Northeast Ohio), substance, dose level, and the same recording process—always recording each session as completely as possible within 24 hours. When you stabilize your work—eliminate variables, use the same methodology consistently—it stabilizes the conversation between you and the creative intelligence of the universe. It stabilizes the communion so that one session leads to the next in a coherent, intelligent manner. You may not understand the continuity as it unfolds, but over time you see patterns and feel you’re engaging a single creative intelligence. I say that carefully—there are many layers and forms of intelligence—but across sessions the continuity is unmistakable.

> a journey. The publisher wanted a more marketable title, and that’s LSD in the Mind of the Universe.
> The beginning of this book goes back over 40 years. In 1978, when I began graduate school, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work. His book Realms of the Human Unconscious turned my life around, followed quickly by LSD Psychotherapy. He gave me the method and the confidence to explore my consciousness and, through that exploration, to come to know the deep psyche—the deep universe—better. I want to emphasize I did this work as a philosopher. I was not a therapist. I wasn’t primarily seeking healing—though healing did come—but seeking to understand our universe as deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness as deeply as I could.

> ing deeper requires yet another cycle of complete surrender to enter the initiation available there.
> Working with high doses of LSD has been compared to a nuclear bomb. The bomb and LSD were both created in the same decade. A long, sustained series of psychedelic experiences, focused therapeutically, triggers a sustained “nuclear explosion”—not only de‑structuring reality as you’ve known it, but exposing deeper levels that were always there but invisible until this explosion brought them into awareness. We’re not talking about bombs, of course; we’re talking about this beautiful universe: 100 billion galaxies, billions of stars in the Milky Way. I’ll use that as backdrop to touch on turning points in my journey and levels of reality I entered.

> Looking back, I identified five core levels or cycles of death and rebirth: personal mind; collective mind (species mind); archetypal mind; causal oneness (the One); and Diamond Luminosity. That’s the structure I used to tell the travelogue in the book.

> Just to add a little more about how I understand what happened in that 20-year journey—mind you, it would take all day to do it justice—the very short version is: in each one of those 73 journeys, the first two hours were, as you described in the book, sometimes exquisitely painful as you went through the difficult process of ego dissolution and beyond—letting go of any kind of identity, even as a human. And then what happened, as I recall, is that you broke out into what you have called the vast intelligences of the universe. Believe me, folks, this is no exaggeration—the kind of material that Chris brought back is absolutely stunning and absolutely relevant to what’s going on on the planet.

> folding into deeper levels of reality. This may not be true for everyone; it simply was true for me.
> LSD is often likened to the atomic bomb, invented in the same decade. I use the nuclear explosion as an image of the combustive fire generated in a long series of sessions—this cycle of death and rebirth. As it continues, it activates and brings into conscious awareness deeper levels of the universe, just as a nuclear explosion brings into visible form atmospheric layers that were always there but hidden. It is the power of the psychedelic dynamic that brings these dimensions into our conscious awareness. We’re not talking about literal explosions, but exploration into the mind of the universe—the cosmic mind.

> At the end of my journey, looking back, I identified five strata I had entered systematically over 20 years: the personal mind; the collective mind (our species); archetypal mind; causal oneness; and diamond luminosity.

> his hypothesis and see how my sessions mapped against the solar system’s rhythms during those years.
> The story I’m telling in LSD in the Mind of the Universe is not primarily a personal story. In one sense it is, but in another sense it’s not. Imagine a series of sessions: after the first 15 or so, insights and help for my personal life tended to come at the beginning and end of sessions, as I was leaving and returning to time-space reality—small circles. During the peak hours—large circles—I was usually operating beyond my personal reality, beyond Chris’s reality—not entirely, but largely. The story I’m telling is what unfolded in those peak hours. It’s primarily a cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. The personal details matter in a therapeutic narrative, not so much in a cosmological one.

> eally look forward to sharing the experiences I report in my book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe.
> David has framed our conversation as the question of whether we can all access the cosmic mind using psychedelics. I believe that we all can, but whether we all should is another matter entirely. In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.

> In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves. What’s important is the vision of the cosmos they contain, and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point we’re coming to.

> osophy of religion, not just for psychology, and I knew I wanted to get involved in doing this work.
> So even though LSD had been made illegal in 1970, I chose to conscientiously break the law and begin a series of rigorously structured sessions following Stan’s protocol. After three medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at high doses. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. I would be much gentler on myself if I were doing it over again, but at the time this is what I was doing to accelerate my own spiritual development. Quickly it evolved into engaging the deep structures of human evolution and trying to support humanity’s spiritual development, and then exploring this marvelous universe that we are part of.

Let’s start with the title: LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I’m not sure everyone can track with you there—the universe has a mind? Tell us what you discovered.

> There was a systematic instruction: one session more or less started where the previous session stopped. When you work systematically, there’s a progressive deepening. It took years to understand what the universe was showing me—where it was taking me. I had a sense of a systematic encounter with an intelligence orchestrating my experience in dialogue with me—not taking any deity or archetypal form, always dissolving into deeper layers of infinity when pressed. That, cumulatively, is the story I’m telling in LSD in the Mind of the Universe.

> ous psychedelic experiences—must be surrendered if a truly new and novel dimension is going to open.
> I asked myself: How many fundamental, core death-rebirth transitions did I go through? There are levels within levels, with iterations that go deeper and deeper. But I identified five core cycles. First, the death of self: the complete shattering of your time-space identity—ego death. Second, entering the collective mind, the collective psyche. Third, entering archetypal mind—the domain described by Jung and Plato, though different than either portray it. Fourth, entering causal oneness. Oneness appears much earlier in the journey, but causal oneness is distinctive: there is no outer boundary. It is the totality of existence; you cannot step outside it to get a perspective on it. Fifth, the domain of Diamond Luminosity, which occupied me for the last five years of my journey.

> In the book, these stages map to chapters: crossing the boundary of birth and death; exploring collective mind—the ocean of suffering, deep time in the soul, initiation into the universe; archetypal mind—the greater real of archetypal reality; causal oneness—a benediction of blessings.

> ive us an outline—what was happening in there, after 70-something sessions of 500 micrograms of LSD?
> Chris Bache:
> That is the question, and it's hard to summarize—it's taken me about 300 pages just to tell the story. There were so many layers. Basically, my experience has been that the universe—or the mind of the universe, or the mind of the divine—is an infinite ocean of potential. When we drop our individual mind into that ocean, it catalyzes experiences out of that infinite potential. As we are changed, influenced, healed, and purified by that exchange, the seed crystal of our mind changes. When we later drop that same, now-transformed mind into the ocean, it catalyzes a deeper set of experiences.

> later. Can you take us further into your sessions to give us a taste of what that was like for you?
> Chris Bache: That’s hard because of context. Some very influential books were based on a limited number of psychedelic experiences. Aldous Huxley wrote The Doors of Perception after one mescaline experience. Huston Smith wrote his reflections after taking LSD six times. Michael Pollan’s helpful book was also after a handful of experiences. The challenge with my work is how long the journey was and how many layers of consciousness opened. It’s not simply opening 73 times to the same interface. There’s a cycle of death and rebirth that reproduces itself. Death breaks you free of one level of reality—physical reality initially—and takes you into a nonphysical spiritual reality. You work there for a while, and if you work consistently, you go through another death and rebirth into another level, where you learn that level’s rules, and so on. Focusing on any one level leaves out many others. Eventually, when putting the whole together, I distinguished five broad categories my sessions fell into: personal mind—your personal unconscious and story; collective mind—the collective psyche, humanity’s species mind; archetypal mind—which for me was more Platonic than Jungian, dimensions outside time and space and outside the collective psyche; causal levels of reality—where oneness becomes the dominant reality; and beyond that, diamond luminosity—a particularly clear dimension of light I worked with in the last five years. My experiences lay out as a sequential journey from personal mind to collective mind, archetypal mind, and so forth.

> ugh your journeys, and how might that relate to the lack of one ultimate level and meta-coexistence?
Chris Bache: That’s a big question. I was a religious studies professor. My first vocation was wanting to be a Catholic priest. I was raised Roman Catholic and spent four years in the seminary. The Catholic tradition treated me well; no trauma. Then I did an undergraduate degree in theology at Notre Dame, a master’s in New Testament criticism at Cambridge, and philosophy of religion at Brown. By the time I finished graduate school, I had pretty much studied my way out of religion altogether. I recapitulated the transition from medieval Catholic theology to the scriptural revolution in Protestantism, to the scientific critique of religion in the modern mind. I finished a fairly sophisticated agnostic with very high standards for any conceptualization of something beyond time and space—something approximating God.

> John Dupuy:
Did you feel you were being held or guided—in some sense taken care of—in this journey?
Chris Bache:
At every step along the way. When I would go through, consciousness was waiting for me. I might not understand the logic of the sequence for years—there are things I only began to understand when I wrote the book—but I had enough structure to know there was a logic to the process. I always felt met and engaged—sometimes very consciously, where I would ask questions and it would orchestrate my experience. There was an intelligence meeting me, taking me, educating me, breaking me down, reducing me to dust, taking me further, taking me back, over and over until I understood something—and then it would take me deeper.

> st one goes something like, “Thus ends the journey that never needed to be made in the first place.”
Chris Bache
Yes. I started this work focused on enlightenment, which is what the Ten Oxherding Pictures are about—awakening to the ever-present condition so that, in the end, you come back to where you were, but with your filters clear and the present luminously there. That was my initial agenda.

But it was superseded by two other aspects. First, the challenges of our collective enlightenment—our collective evolution. Eventually my personal healing or enlightenment was superseded by responding to the call to support our collective transformation in history. Second, that was superseded by the opportunity to explore the deep structure of the universe itself—a cosmological exploration. You don’t need to explore the universe’s deep structure to awaken to your essential nature. These are different projects. My work combined the enlightenment project but yielded to a different one—the philosopher’s project: an invitation to explore, as far as I could, the nature of cosmic reality.

> to historically specific expressions.

Stephen Gray:
Was there a visual component to these journeys?
Chris Bache:
Very strong visual components—not hallucinatory. I could lift my eye shades mid-journey and not be hallucinating. The visuals were very deep, but I never saw the intelligence I was experiencing so intimately. It would purify me—beat me up, crush me, destroy me—and then, after purification, receive me, educate me, take me through things until it was sure I understood, then take me deeper. But it never adopted an identifiable form.

> e saying corresponds, deepens, and fills out what I’ve learned in my own journey. So how’s it going?
Chris Bache:
It’s going just as you say. There’s nothing unique about my experiences—they’re part of our collective experiences that push the boundaries in certain ways. Many people have written to say I clarified their experiences—“Here’s what I experienced around this topic.” Many have written, “I’ve never touched psychedelics in my life, but I’ve had experiences completely in alignment with yours. Let me explain mine.” Clearly this is a large pattern emerging within the collective psyche. It’s a joy to share and to enter into conversation with other journeyers.

> art, but to continue evolving. Do you feel your journey confirms Buddhism, and where does it differ?
Chris Bache
I’ve been deeply influenced by all the world’s religions. I began as a Christian and a Catholic—four years in seminary studying for the priesthood. I studied Hebrew and Greek for biblical work. I’ve learned so much from Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Native traditions. The two deepest, longest-lasting influences on me have been Christianity and Buddhism.

I think my journey affirms the deepest truths of Christianity and of all the world’s religions—Judaism’s Kabbalah, Hinduism, Buddhism—while also, in important ways, eclipsing the religions of the last several thousand years. The universe I was initiated into demanded levels of understanding beyond anything I had learned in those traditions. I had to become operational within a deeper metaphysics.

> cosmological exploration? And how might someone structure them if they’re aimed at the other goals?
Chris Bache:
I didn’t understand much of this at the time; I understood it only after going a long way down the road and looking back at how my choices affected the trajectory. The dose decision is significant. Working with high doses, you completely surrender to the process. It’s impossible to direct it. You can set all the good intentions you want, but the states that arise with high doses, amplified by carefully selected music and internalization in a kiva-like practice, set in motion processes so powerful you can’t control them. The strategy is to surrender—let consciousness take you wherever it wants, show you whatever it wants, no matter how inscrutable, painful, or absurd it seems at the time.

> going to do X amount of sessions,” or did you go in saying, “I’ll have a few and see where it goes”?
Chris Bache
No trajectory or goal. I saw the range of experiences Stan described in Realms of the Human Unconscious. With my grounding in Western philosophical and theological thought, I appreciated the significance of these states. I believed that people making the most important contributions in my discipline would be speaking from an experiential basis in a matter of years, not just a theoretical one. To do that, you have to get in and do the work. I had no idea how long it would be. Early on, I thought you go through ego death and then get unrestricted access to deep consciousness. What I found is the universe has many layers. While it’s all holographically integrated, if you engage systematically with a careful methodology, the universe takes you in by degrees, by layers. As you move into a new layer of consciousness and stabilize there, if you keep pushing, you go to the edge of that layer and through another death-and-rebirth process—different than ego death but building on it. You go through a series of death-and-rebirth processes as you explore progressively deeper levels. That’s how it happened for me. There was a systematic progression into communion with the universe. That’s how I laid out the book: beginning to end, consolidating the story, each chapter moving into another level of consciousness or engagement.

> ience at the right time. In your journeys you describe a sense of guidance. Could you speak to that?
Chris Bache:
I always felt myself engaging—and being engaged by—a larger consciousness. It didn’t take concrete, personified form. Its core qualities changed as I went deeper. The way I think of it: the consciousness we enter into in psychedelic states is an infinite consciousness capable of generating any number of experiences. Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from this infinite field.

If you do this repeatedly, as you integrate experiences and undergo purifications, your consciousness changes. The consciousness you take into the next encounter catalyzes a deeper set of experiences from the infinite potential. What you experience as a guiding intelligence arises at the intersection of your individual mind and the universal mind; as you change, that intersection changes. The guiding consciousness felt constant to me but remained formless, seldom adopting concrete form—because forms would change as the experiences deepened.

> you unpick a bit of the structure you see as useful for helping us move toward being future humans?
Chris Bache
There are several things rolled into your observations—all good. First, I think integration is very important. We have the chemical technology to trigger very deep states of consciousness, but these states may have very little lasting impact on our deeply ingrained psychological and cultural habits if we don't take time to sit with them and integrate them as deeply as we can into our embodied existence.

Over the course of my work, even though I was paying a lot of attention and doing as good a job as I could to integrate each individual session, I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey. I didn't fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey and realized how hard the stopping hit me, exposing the imbalance—the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences, which were the deepest: being drawn into intimacy, into communion with—I want to say the divine, but I'm cautious because we have to unpack theological baggage.

> nced this profoundly in your psychedelic journeys—the constant states of transformation and rebirth.
Chris Bache
Yes. When I started, I thought there was just one death—ego death—that would launch you into the spiritual universe. But the spiritual universe has many layers. Being operational at one layer doesn’t mean you’re operational at deeper layers. You go through another metamorphosis—another death and surrender—to be reborn into another layer, and so on. That reflects the Tibetan idea of Bardo: a discrete layer of consciousness. In describing the after-death journey, there are multiple Bardos you pass through—the hungry ghosts, heavenly spirits, and so on. In the West, we often use Bardo to represent the totality of what happens after death, and that’s fine, but the original use points to stages in a progression.

> aker:
You used the term “breadth” as well as depth—like bandwidth—which I hadn’t heard put that way.
Chris Bache:
In certain experiences, breadth is a useful metaphor for the ways we connect with humanity, other persons, nature—states of consciousness that are extremely wide, so to speak. Depth is different: entering contact with deeper levels of reality—other systems, other beings, archetypal realities, the void, the pure cosmic void. Different categories of experience.

Jef Baker:
That might be a good point to talk about archetypes.

Chris Bache:
When I got to the end of the journey, I looked back and asked how many fundamental platforms of consciousness I had entered. I boiled them down to five: work at the personal level; work at the collective mind—where the ocean of suffering arose and purification aimed at the collective more than the personal; then the archetypal dimension; then oneness or causal consciousness; and finally what I call the diamond luminosity—what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.

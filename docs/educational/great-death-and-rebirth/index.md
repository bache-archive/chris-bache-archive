> Christopher M. Bache is a scholar and author known for his exploration of consciousness, reincarnation, and the transformative potential of psychedelic experiences. His work delves into the intricate relationship between death and rebirth, particularly in the context of high-dose LSD sessions, and examines how these experiences can facilitate personal and collective awakening. Bache's contributions to the fields of psychology and spirituality offer a nuanced perspective on the nature of existence and the cycles of life.

> y fear—fear of dying, fear of loss. If you lose that fear of dying, you live from a different place.
> LSD and the Mind of the Universe is a psychedelic memoir—a whole life’s work. I like the title Diamonds from Heaven better because it’s a story of a journey of deepening intimacy. After sessions, even a grocery store can feel like Disneyland—strange and surreal. That’s our work: go into deeper intimacy with whatever drives the universe, then come back and live our lives as best we can. Reincarnation does this—pulling us out into spiritual reality, plunging us back in, over and over. A psychedelic session reenacts that on a smaller orbit: it shatters the earthly life, opens us to what it’s like to die into the great surrounding world, then we come back into time and space. Do that enough times—incarnate enough times—and you cease to relate to the world as before.

> At very high doses of LSD, one goes through a series of death-rebirth experiences. The first takes place at the interface of our time-space consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness—usually referred to as ego death, the complete destruction of our personal time-space identity and the opening into spiritual reality. If we continue and press deeper, we go through more deaths at the psychic, subtle, and causal levels of consciousness, to use Stan’s terms.

> ing deeper requires yet another cycle of complete surrender to enter the initiation available there.
> Working with high doses of LSD has been compared to a nuclear bomb. The bomb and LSD were both created in the same decade. A long, sustained series of psychedelic experiences, focused therapeutically, triggers a sustained “nuclear explosion”—not only de‑structuring reality as you’ve known it, but exposing deeper levels that were always there but invisible until this explosion brought them into awareness. We’re not talking about bombs, of course; we’re talking about this beautiful universe: 100 billion galaxies, billions of stars in the Milky Way. I’ll use that as backdrop to touch on turning points in my journey and levels of reality I entered.

> Jeffrey Mishlove: Psychedelics amplify consciousness. Some people take them looking for a good afternoon: a little more openness to life and love. They keep the fundamental parameters of their personality, just softer and more expansive, which is perfectly fine. But if you want a deep dive—exploring the deep structure of existence, transcending space and time, moving into the deep future—that requires a carefully laid-out strategy. I’m not suggesting my way is the only beneficial way. As a philosopher, I was looking for depth of immersion and understanding, and that takes serious work.

> Jeffrey Mishlove: This became a real intellectual issue for me. When you experience dying and being reborn through multiple levels of reality, it raises the question: what is actually dying? You can have deep experiences of dying years after ego-death, and it’s not simply the ego dying over and over. It’s a different kind of death.

> h and rebirth on higher levels of the transpersonal spectrum, with no relation to biological birth.”
> Let’s move to the next question: Why does dying repeat itself so many times in psychedelic therapy? Returning to my personal story, when this long phase of collective dying and rebirth had ended, it was followed by a series of five overwhelmingly positive sessions that seemed to constitute a megarebirth. I felt overwhelmed by grace, filled with blessings, with a deep sense that I’d accomplished the primary purpose of my incarnation. At that point, after all those years, I hoped that the ordeal of dying would stop eventually; I thought the transition to transpersonal reality would become easier—and I think it would have, if I had stayed within the boundaries of transpersonal experience I had thus far initiated. But for better or worse, the method of exploration I’d chosen was so powerful it kept pushing me beyond my experiential limits. I was working with five to six hundred micrograms of LSD in totally internalized sessions.

> I'd like to return to that. One of the themes in your work is giving a really persuasive case for reincarnation. I already sort of believed in reincarnation from my own explorations, but you make a really solid case for it. You wrote a book, Life Cycles, about it, and then later on, in your most recent book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe, you said there were things you didn’t quite get to in that book. Could you describe your current understanding of reincarnation?
> 
> Chris Bache:
> As a philosopher, I think reincarnation is a fundamental concept to examine, because philosophical traditions diverge: if you believe there is no reincarnation versus if you believe there is, you end up with two different understandings of reality. Early in my academic career, I looked seriously at whether there is empirical evidence for reincarnation. Fifty years ago, this evidence did not exist, but today it does. I think we have ample empirical evidence that reincarnation is a simple fact of life.

> That’s a lot of LSD, to put it mildly. I want to tease out your description of death-rebirth. It’s recognized across the world’s spiritual traditions as a profound psycho-spiritual birth experience and deliberately sought in traditions such as shamanism. You describe it in a radically expanded way—as a repetitive process of dying to one identity and limitation after another, reconstituting a new, more porous, expanded identity, and then having to offer that into the whole.

> eriences on that journey. My life has never been the same. How do you thank someone for such a gift?
> The experience of dying and being reborn is central to holotropic and psychedelic work, yet it remains deeply puzzling. This morning, I’d like to share my attempts to address three basic questions about the death-rebirth dynamic. First: Why does death become as large as it sometimes does in psychedelic therapy? Second: Why does death repeat itself so many times in this long process? And third, and perhaps most difficultly: What is actually dying in the death-rebirth process? Along the way, I’d also like to revise the discussion of death-rebirth that I presented in Dark Night, Early Dawn, which I now find incomplete.

> death and about life and about our future as individuals and as a species. It’s a beautiful vision.
> Chris Bache:
> Every time we die, at the deepest level all spiritual traditions tell us no one dies—we transition into a different level of reality. I’m not making light of death or trivializing it, only affirming this deeper insight: everything we are survives the death of the body. At the end of every lifetime, we return to where we came from as a resting place. We are restored and refreshed, and then we return to the challenges of history. We don’t have to live through all the evolutionary future to know freedom from the fear of death. If there were one thing from my psychedelic experiences I wish I could give the world, it would be eliminating the fear of death. I am not only unafraid of dying—I’m looking forward to it, because death is homecoming. Always, death is homecoming.
> 
> Simeon Mihaylov:
> Different spiritual traditions have said that in different ways. Carl Jung says at one point that life is a short period between two infinities—which, in the end, might just be one. I think that’s a beautiful way of putting it.

> k of all my sessions, noting dates, and making a detailed record within 24 hours after each session.
> When you work in a sustained fashion with powerful psychedelics at high doses of LSD, you don’t go through one death and rebirth; you go through a series of deaths and rebirths. Our time-space identity—our ego—dies, and one enters spiritual reality. Repeating this surrender leads to deeper encounters with the structures of existence. I follow Stan in adopting his vocabulary to describe these states as the psychic level of transpersonal experience, the subtle level, and the causal level. LSD is sometimes likened to a nuclear bomb of the psyche—developed in the same decade as the nuclear bomb. A sustained, very intense psychotherapeutic process sets in motion a catalytic energy sustained over years. Sessions get deeper and deeper in a sustained fashion. It’s not unlike a nuclear explosion revealing deeper levels of the atmosphere: they were always there, but previously invisible, and now the force brings them into awareness. This is just an analogy, but in sustained psychedelic work, you don’t simply start over at the beginning of every session; one session starts where the previous left off. You go deeper and eventually enter discrete levels of consciousness with their own rules. You acclimate and learn to become consciously aware at these depths. We’re not talking about nuclear bombs—we’re talking about entering the mind of the universe, the great expanse of consciousness. Some would call it God or the Divine; I prefer the mind of the universe, the mind of the cosmos. In my journey into this vast consciousness that holds all existence, I went through multiple layers, experiencing deaths and rebirths along the way.

> ous psychedelic experiences—must be surrendered if a truly new and novel dimension is going to open.
> I asked myself: How many fundamental, core death-rebirth transitions did I go through? There are levels within levels, with iterations that go deeper and deeper. But I identified five core cycles. First, the death of self: the complete shattering of your time-space identity—ego death. Second, entering the collective mind, the collective psyche. Third, entering archetypal mind—the domain described by Jung and Plato, though different than either portray it. Fourth, entering causal oneness. Oneness appears much earlier in the journey, but causal oneness is distinctive: there is no outer boundary. It is the totality of existence; you cannot step outside it to get a perspective on it. Fifth, the domain of Diamond Luminosity, which occupied me for the last five years of my journey.
> 
> In the book, these stages map to chapters: crossing the boundary of birth and death; exploring collective mind—the ocean of suffering, deep time in the soul, initiation into the universe; archetypal mind—the greater real of archetypal reality; causal oneness—a benediction of blessings.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe**

> LSD and the Mind of the Universe is the memoir of a psychedelic explorer. It is the story of one person’s journey into the mind of the cosmos. I’ve tried to tell this story as concisely as I can, focusing on the journey itself and keeping theoretical discussion to a minimum. I will rely on other authors to give the reader the history and science of psychedelics, their psychopharmacology, and their clinical applications. I share my psychedelic experiences here not because I think they are special or unique, for they are not, but because, all things considered, they are the most valuable gift I have to offer the psychedelic conversation.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶20 (1)**

> This insight invites us to think about the dynamics of death and rebirth more multidimensionally. It is an insight that generalizes across multiple levels of reality. At the subtle level of consciousness, for example, death and rebirth may open a portal that serves not only to drain destructive energies out of the species-mind but also to infuse healing energies into the species-mind from a higher source, as the sessions reported in chapter 8 demonstrate. At still deeper levels, such portals may allow any number of transcendental blessings to be infused directly into lower orders of existence. The question then becomes: How does the addition of this principle of *infusion from above* influence the question of how we might understand what is dying and being reborn at these deep levels of psychedelic experience?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶1 (1)**

> My psychedelic journey generated a repeating cycle of death and rebirth that systematically initiated me into progressively deeper levels of consciousness. This generates a thought-provoking question: What exactly is dying and being reborn in this spiral of initiation? There is often an acute sensation of dying at the deeper levels, but what does this sensation attach to? Is it simply ego dying over and over again, or is there something more going on? I want to briefly propose four overlapping answers to this question.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶4 (1 · 12)**

> Confronting our personal shadow is always challenging work, but to understand the deeper suffering that emerges on this journey, we must understand the role that death and rebirth play in an extended psychedelic practice. The experience of dying and being reborn is one of the central dynamics of therapeutically focused psychedelic work. Death is simply the price one is asked to pay to gain access to the myriad worlds that lie beyond the body-mind ego, death not as a metaphor or symbolic enactment but the agonizing loss of everything we know to be real and true, the spasm of our last breath, the terrifying surrender. Death comes in many shapes and sizes. It may steal in softly, melting our resistance slowly, or break through the door violently with drums pounding. Either way, if we want to experience the deeper currents of the cosmos, sooner or later death calls to us.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶15 (6 · 1)**

> The proposal that death and rebirth take place at multiple levels of consciousness falls within the broad framework of Grof’s body of work, where he points to the numerous forms that death can take at transpersonal levels. In *The Ultimate Journey*, for example, he writes:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe**

> And last, this book has two titles, what Tibetans would call an outer title and an inner title. LSD and the Mind of the Universe is its outer title, describing what the book is about—exploring the mind of the universe through carefully conducted LSD sessions. Diamonds from Heaven is its inner title, describing its innermost essence, for at the center of the mind of the universe, one enters the infinite clear light of Diamond Luminosity.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶7 (1 · 8)**

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §4 ¶15 (2 · 4)**

> The death-rebirth process is never fully completed in a single session. Many sessions of repeatedly engaging the same issues are required before one has exhausted them. The usual pattern is that a subject working at this level will eventually experience a major perinatal crisis centering on one of the phases described above. Yielding to and resolving the crisis will usually shift the person into positive transpersonal experiences for the remainder of the session even though perinatal content may remain for future sessions. If the process is continued through serial sessions, a final death-rebirth experience eventually will completely exhaust all perinatal content. Making copious use of case histories, Grof has demonstrated that systematically engaging this traumatic material can actually dissolve the perinatal matrices, thus permanently removing their influence from the individual’s behavior. In subsequent sessions, the subject moves directly into transpersonal experience as the journey in consciousness continues. Grof has found that *every single person who reaches this level in their work adopts a spiritual interpretation of existence, regardless of their prior psychosocial conditioning*. This includes such unmystical types as staunch atheists, skeptics, Marxists, and positivistically oriented scientists.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶7 (1 · 12)**

> Because the universe is infinitely deep with many layers, one faces many deaths on this journey. Ego-death is only the first. Death and rebirth is a cycle that repeats itself multiple times because the universe tends to yield its treasures in layers. The death of the egoic self is followed by other deaths at deeper levels, harder to describe because the terrain is less familiar but no less demanding to undergo.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §6 ¶12 (7 · 6)**

> Let me take this one step further. When this cycle of purification reaches particularly deep, it becomes a *cycle of death and rebirth*. I had originally thought that death and rebirth was a one-time event, but after going through this cycle multiple times at different levels of consciousness, I began to realize that in psychedelic sessions, *“death” is actually a very intense form of purification*.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §6 ¶13 (7 · 6)**

> After you have died and been reborn many times in your sessions, eventually the very concept of death begins to lose its meaning. You learn through repetition that at the deepest level of your being, it is impossible to die. The form that we are can be shattered, our reality can be repeatedly destroyed, but our innermost essence always reemerges. The phoenix always rises. When the process of purification reaches particularly deep, when it reaches so deep that it begins to dissolve the structure of our life as we have known it, it becomes *purification unto death*. When it empties us of all that we have known and all that we have been, a crisis is reached where what we have been collapses and we are carried forward into a new level of reality.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)**

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

In transpersonal consciousness, the first Death-Rebirth experience takes place at the interface of our time-space consciousness and the beginnings of spiritual consciousness, and it's usually referred to as ego death.

> rough cycles of death and rebirth, their significance, and how they facilitate collective awakening.
Chris Bache:
First, what I’m going to describe is my variation on an ancient Buddhist teaching. When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.

> and rebirth. How has that process impacted you? What was that like for you during these experiences?
Chris Bache: Violence may not be quite the right word. It shows up in the early stages when you're going through powerful kriyas and this tremendous physical and emotional detoxification, which can leave you in convulsions, bouncing around the mattress, as your body throws off vast quantities of physical and emotional stress. There is a certain violence in dying. Over the course of the work, I learned that the deepest breakthroughs followed the deepest purifications, and the deepest deaths yielded the deepest ecstatic joys on the other side. As that became clear, death became my closest ally. Rather than trying to avoid harsh confrontations, I did everything I could to facilitate their emergence. I went right at it—not because I like suffering, but because I like what was on the other side. I came to understand that even death in a psychedelic context is a form of purification: letting go of reality as you know it at one level to gain access to reality at a deeper level. So it became part of the work.

> Chris a chance to connect the living universe with the evolution of life through that living system.
Chris Bache
In that context, let me say something hard and consoling at the same time. From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.

Chris Bache:
Health world? I think it's great. And if you do your work well, one of the things that happens is you lose all fear of death. Once you transition several times into that reality, you know in your bones, from your own experience, that death is not an end of anything. It's simply the end of an incarnational cycle, and there is absolutely nothing to fear about death. Death is homecoming. All of the Hollywood bullshit thrown up at us—dark places and demons and ghosts and all this stuff—it's just nonsense. Ninety-nine percent of people die and make a transition into the light perfectly naturally and comfortably. If you're afraid of dying, you've got your entire metaphysics upside down. Death is homecoming. Death is the end of your matriculation. It's the harvesting of your life. Birth should be mourned. Birth is where the work begins. It's like being a freshman in college—it's hard. Graduation is wonderful, right?

> back for that one. It’s really good to bear these things in mind as we move through intense periods.
Chris Bache: Let’s allow ourselves to look deep into the future of this future human. Whatever transformation we’re going through—and we agree it’s acute, giving birth to a new order of human capacity—however long it takes, the human story isn’t stopping. The evolutionary drama isn’t ending. This is a new platform within which the story will continue to develop. We’ve been evolving by learning from suffering, our great teacher in much of the past, but we’re getting past that—just as we’re growing out of our fear of death. If there were one thing I wish I could give people from my sessions, it would be to lose the fear of death. If you’re afraid of death, your cosmology is upside down. You don’t understand what’s going on. Death is graduation. Death is the great respite, the great reward.

> nced this profoundly in your psychedelic journeys—the constant states of transformation and rebirth.
Chris Bache
Yes. When I started, I thought there was just one death—ego death—that would launch you into the spiritual universe. But the spiritual universe has many layers. Being operational at one layer doesn’t mean you’re operational at deeper layers. You go through another metamorphosis—another death and surrender—to be reborn into another layer, and so on. That reflects the Tibetan idea of Bardo: a discrete layer of consciousness. In describing the after-death journey, there are multiple Bardos you pass through—the hungry ghosts, heavenly spirits, and so on. In the West, we often use Bardo to represent the totality of what happens after death, and that’s fine, but the original use points to stages in a progression.

> orced since first experiencing it in the late 1990s, to the writing of the book, to the present day?
Chris Bache: It hasn't changed one bit. I say in the book that when I had the experience in session 55—the death and rebirth of humanity in 1995—for weeks I walked around like I was walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb went off. I have carried in my being, in my body, a knowing of where we are in history and what's coming.

When I look around, whether I agree with people politically or socially or not, I see heroes. I see every human being here on this planet as having incarnated voluntarily, choosing to be part of this evolutionary pivot. Every person here—even though they may not remember it—has chosen to be here, and this is going to be a very difficult period to incarnate. The beings who are part of the incarnation process are extraordinarily powerful, valuable beings.

> g from that into something else. Could you give a step-by-step of what the early stages looked like?
Chris Bache:
For about the first two years, I worked at what Stan Grof describes as the perinatal level of consciousness—the interface between personal egoic reality in space-time and early transpersonal consciousness. I had many experiences of reliving my own birth, experiences of death and dying, until, after about two and a half years, my personal reality was shattered. I died as the person I had known myself to be and was then reborn into a reality that radically transcended Chris Bache's reality. At that point, I was working deep within the collective unconscious, and the process began again.

> tures within which you are holding reality. So it’s death, but a fluid death—a purification process.
John Dupuy:
So, Chris, following up on what Roger asked about what dies—what doesn’t die? Because in your book you talk a lot about reincarnation as a given in the universe as it was revealed to you—this universe, multiverse, whatever this mysterium tremendum is that you’ve brought back to us. So what doesn’t die?

Chris Bache:
When we go deep, we realize that everything is dying and living, dying and living, constantly. There are no stable things which are not dying in this universe. To see that clearly is considered a great accomplishment—to really understand that everything is temporary, transitional, moving, fluid. People have asked me, “What is it that dies?” What I will say is there is always continuity of memory. If you organize your session well, there is continuity of recall; therefore there is continuity of memory. You might say that memory doesn’t die, but I don’t think that’s the best way to describe it. I think memory is shattered and reconstituted. I don’t know what doesn’t die, but—

John Dupuy:
—is being purified, right? What is it that’s being purified?

> e case: a painful birth to transition into a more functional, balanced species. Could you elaborate?
Chris Bache: I explore this in a chapter called “The Birth of the Future Human,” and earlier in “The Great Awakening” in Dark Night, Early Dawn (2000). I was uncomfortable entering this territory at first—I’m not drawn to historical speculation. I began this work for individual healing and enlightenment, and that premise was blown away within a few years. The purification, the access to information and knowledge—everything seemed to be in service of the species as a whole. It’s not that our species is special in the universe, but the Divine’s focus here, now, seems species-wide.

This emphasis repeated so often and strongly that the gist of my 20-year journey became the collective story of death and rebirth. I have deep convictions that we’ve entered the dark night of our collective soul—a period of purification, confronting the sins of our fathers and mothers, which are our own through reincarnation. We’re facing our past choices and their consequences, purifying the toxins they left, to open into new dimensions of our being.

> h the previous experience. If you re-listened, it would tend to pull you back toward that territory?
Chris Bache
It would tend to, or at least there was the potential for it to pull you in that direction. Maybe not the second time, but with repeated listening it can narrow your experience instead of expanding and opening it.

Ryan Kemp
As you touched on, what you came to learn was a series of iterated deaths and rebirths in one body, which appears in Stan Grof’s work as well. Could you talk about how you view that—and its relationship to actual death and rebirth as we know it, the leaving of this form and coming back into a new form?

Chris Bache
It took me a long time to understand the patterns of my sessions. In some ways they started as I expected, drawing upon Stan’s map of consciousness, but after a few years they seemed to diverge and enter new territory. One thing I’ve come to understand is that consciousness has many levels—operational tiers. Each time you enter a new level, there is required a surrender of everything you had known and assumed before, in order to enter a level that operates by completely different rules.

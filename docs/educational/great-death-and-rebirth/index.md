*Bache’s LSD practice reframed death–rebirth as a repeating, purifying initiation through successively deeper layers of consciousness, dissolving fear of death and widening identity from the personal to the collective—and sometimes the cosmic.*

## Curated weave (book-first)

> “The experience of dying and being reborn is one of the central dynamics… Death is simply the price one is asked to pay to gain access to the myriad worlds that lie beyond the body-mind ego… either way, if we want to experience the deeper currents of the cosmos, sooner or later death calls to us.”  
— **LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶4**

Early on, he learned that this “price” is paid again and again—not once.

> “When this cycle of purification reaches particularly deep, it becomes a *cycle of death and rebirth*… I began to realize that in psychedelic sessions, *‘death’ is actually a very intense form of purification*.”  
— **LSDMU ch.7 §6 ¶12**

> “After you have died and been reborn many times… the very concept of death begins to lose its meaning… our innermost essence always reemerges. The phoenix always rises… when it empties us of all that we have known… we are carried forward into a new level of reality.”  
— **LSDMU ch.7 §6 ¶13**

This repetition unfolds as a spiral through levels.

> “I now see death and rebirth as a cycle that repeats many times as we move into progressively deeper levels of consciousness… looking back… the death-rebirth cycle was repeating itself in different forms at different levels of consciousness.”  
— **LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶10**

What, then, dies?

> “My psychedelic journey generated a repeating cycle of death and rebirth… What exactly is dying and being reborn…? Is it simply ego dying over and over again, or is there something more going on? I want to briefly propose four overlapping answers…”  
— **LSDMU Appendix I §1 ¶1**

Practice made this possible.

> “Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy… these early sessions… functioned as an intensive training camp… They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.”  
— **LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5**

Together, these passages show Bache’s view: death–rebirth is archetypal purification that repeats across layers—first ego, then deeper identities—training us to surrender, widen identity, and eventually lose the fear of dying.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶4**
> Confronting our personal shadow is always challenging work, but to understand the deeper suffering that emerges on this journey, we must understand the role that death and rebirth play in an extended psychedelic practice. The experience of dying and being reborn is one of the central dynamics of therapeutically focused psychedelic work. Death is simply the price one is asked to pay to gain access to the myriad worlds that lie beyond the body-mind ego, death not as a metaphor or symbolic enactment but the agonizing loss of everything we know to be real and true, the spasm of our last breath, the terrifying surrender. Death comes in many shapes and sizes. It may steal in softly, melting our resistance slowly, or break through the door violently with drums pounding. Either way, if we want to experience the deeper currents of the cosmos, sooner or later death calls to us.

**LSDMU ch.7 §6 ¶12**
> Let me take this one step further. When this cycle of purification reaches particularly deep, it becomes a *cycle of death and rebirth*. I had originally thought that death and rebirth was a one-time event, but after going through this cycle multiple times at different levels of consciousness, I began to realize that in psychedelic sessions, *“death” is actually a very intense form of purification*.

**LSDMU ch.7 §6 ¶13**
> After you have died and been reborn many times in your sessions, eventually the very concept of death begins to lose its meaning. You learn through repetition that at the deepest level of your being, it is impossible to die. The form that we are can be shattered, our reality can be repeatedly destroyed, but our innermost essence always reemerges. The phoenix always rises. When the process of purification reaches particularly deep, when it reaches so deep that it begins to dissolve the structure of our life as we have known it, it becomes *purification unto death*. When it empties us of all that we have known and all that we have been, a crisis is reached where what we have been collapses and we are carried forward into a new level of reality.

**LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶10**
> At the present time, however, I have shifted to what I think is a simpler and more elegant way of understanding the ocean of suffering. I now see death and rebirth as a cycle that repeats many times as we move into progressively deeper levels of consciousness. Being an archetypal cycle, any single death-rebirth experience may incorporate material from multiple levels of consciousness. But looking back over the trajectory of all my sessions, I now recognize that the death-rebirth cycle was repeating itself in different forms at different levels of consciousness. The image below may help convey this point.

**LSDMU Appendix I §1 ¶1**
> My psychedelic journey generated a repeating cycle of death and rebirth that systematically initiated me into progressively deeper levels of consciousness. This generates a thought-provoking question: What exactly is dying and being reborn in this spiral of initiation? There is often an acute sensation of dying at the deeper levels, but what does this sensation attach to? Is it simply ego dying over and over again, or is there something more going on? I want to briefly propose four overlapping answers to this question.

**LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5**
> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

> When one works with very high doses of LSD, one goes through a series of Death-Rebirth experiences… the first Death-Rebirth… is usually referred to as ego death. It is the complete destruction of our personal time-space identity and the beginning of an opening into spiritual reality.

> Over the course of the work, I learned that the deepest breakthroughs followed the deepest purifications, and the deepest deaths yielded the deepest ecstatic joys on the other side… I came to understand that even death in a psychedelic context is a form of purification…

> Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective… The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness… your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity.

## Notes & synthesis
Transcripts confirm the book’s core: death–rebirth repeats as purification across tiers (ego → deeper identities), requiring disciplined surrender and training. They extend the frame to species-level transformation (Session 55) and repeatedly emphasize the practical fruit—loss of death-fear. Minor differences are of emphasis, not direction.

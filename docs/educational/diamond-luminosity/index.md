> This educational page explores the concept of "Diamond Luminosity," a term used to describe specific states of consciousness encountered in deep experiential work. It delves into the philosophical and psychological dimensions of these experiences, which are characterized by a profound sense of clarity and connection to a reality beyond conventional existence. The discussion also touches on the implications of these states for understanding the nature of consciousness and the human experience.

> That’s not a silly question at all. A bit of background: “Diamond Luminosity” points to states of consciousness I entered in the last five years of my work. I had already gone through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal process and a really solid ego death. I had entered what I later called the ocean of suffering at the collective psyche level, gone into archetypal reality, causal-level reality—many adventures—and I felt philosophically satiated and complete. I was experiencing profound oneness with existence, touching the meta-cosmic void, standing under the waterfall of cosmic love. I was existentially very satisfied.

I had known light many times. “Diamond Luminosity” is not just a fancy metaphor. I learned there are many degrees and dimensions of light, and the Diamond Luminosity is an exceptionally pure, exceptionally clear dimension of light. I think the diamond soul, as an assay light being, is a manifestation of this quality of light inside individuated existence. So on the one hand it’s the same, and on the other it’s a variation. I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily identical, but it’s very close.

> sity domain opened to me only four times, and these are the four sessions I present in this chapter.
> My understanding is that Diamond Luminosity is an extra-Samsara reality—it lies outside the Bardo, outside of Samsara, outside all the cycles of physical reality and the Bardo realities of psychic reality. It is the pure light from which the universe arises and returns. It is Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. In between these four immersions, there were many intense episodes of cleansing and personal healing. In general, there were two movements during this four-year period: first, going deeper into Diamond Luminosity; then Diamond Luminosity began to crunch itself more deeply into my physical body. The turning point for this was Session 50. I only began to understand what was happening after the fact. I had no control over what was happening in the sessions; I went along with wherever the universe was taking me and only figured out afterward what had taken place. In Session 50, I was as deep into the universe as I ever went. I was in the clearest, most sublime state of Diamond Luminosity I had ever known. Then everything in my visual field pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw a reality far into the distance that looked like luminous galaxies. A ray of light from that reality hit me, and it absolutely shattered me. I call it the absolute light, just to give it a name. What it showed me is that the universe we explore in these deep states of consciousness is endless. I would never get to the end of the divine mind, the cosmic mind, even using this powerful method of exploration.

> ime we have. I discuss this in Dark Night, Early Dawn and again in LSD and the Mind of the Universe.
> After the Benediction of Blessings, I had no idea where the work would go. I felt I had been drawn deep into the cosmic process, overwhelmed with cosmic love, taken into the fertile void beneath all physical existence. I didn’t know what was next, but there were still five years ahead. The Diamond Luminosity chapter gathers four years of work and 26 sessions—the most of any chapter. After yet one more intense death-and-rebirth, I was taken into what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality: a domain of consciousness of absolute, pure light. The most striking thing was how clear—clear beyond imagination—this domain was. Just touching it for a few minutes was life-transforming. It was beyond the species-mind, beyond archetypal reality, beyond any derivative of physical consciousness—into a hyper-clear, celestial state. Over the next four years, I entered this reality four times—only four out of 26 sessions took me deep into it. The session titles were Death State, Diamond Luminosity, The Universal Field of Light, and The Nature of Mind. In between, as you might imagine, there were many sessions of intense purification because this was a much more pure level of reality and required the purification of my physical and psychological system to stabilize consciousness there. Also scattered throughout, a great deal of personal healing took place—curious to me because I would have thought personal healing would have occurred earlier, but I came to understand why things unfolded in that order. The first two of these sessions took me deeper into Diamond Luminosity, peaking in the 50th session. The second two—60 and 66—saw Diamond Luminosity crunching deeper into my physical and psychological system, into my body.

> Diamond Luminosity is discussed in Chapter 10, the largest in the book—26 sessions, almost a third of the entire journey. Before I talk about Diamond Luminosity, I talk about the birth of the future human, a series of experiences that began during initiation into the universe and continued into the Diamond Luminosity work. At the end, in the last year, there was a final vision that became the capstone of the birth of the future human. It’s impossible to do more than touch on a few themes to give a sense of the trajectory—so first, let’s do that.

> diamond luminosity was crunching itself deeper into my mind, personality, physiology, biochemistry.
> In the 50th session, a particular experience in diamond luminosity radically changed my understanding of existence. I’d pushed hard, thinking the purpose was to reach a final condition—to get home, to become one with the universe or the metacosmic void. I’d had many experiences of oneness and learned there are degrees of oneness; I’d experienced the primal void and learned there are degrees of the void. At the peak of diamond luminosity, resting intact in a deeply blissful state, my visual field pivoted 90 degrees. A circle opened, and in the far distance I saw a reality far beyond diamond luminosity—a domain of light. A ray of light came from that reality and hit me; it shattered me. It took minutes to recover. That’s when I understood it’s an infinite progression. We’ll never get to the end of it. Even with this aggressive mode of exploration, I’d never reach the end. The mind of the universe is too vast. There is a homecoming, yes, but the idea of an end that changes everything—I don’t think so. Oneness is beautiful and important, but even oneness does not exhaust what the universe has to teach.

> hat I call Diamond Luminosity—what Buddhism calls the Absolute, the clear light of absolute reality.
> After I finished my sessions, Spirit said to me in meditation, “20 years in, 20 years out.” I took that to mean it would take me 20 years to fully assimilate and integrate 20 years of sessions. As it turned out, LSD and the Mind of the Universe—what I prefer to call Diamonds from Heaven—was published exactly 20 years after I finished. So it was 20 years of exploration, followed by 20 years of digesting, reflecting, integrating, and finally telling the story. I share it in the hope it will be useful to others—both journeyers and non-journeyers engaged in spiritual practices—because the cosmology that emerges, and the understanding of the processes we’re all engaged in, may be helpful.

> e meta-cosmic void, standing under the waterfall of cosmic love. I was existentially very satisfied.
> But in the last five years—26 sessions—I was catapulted, after another series of death-and-rebirth experiences, into a state of consciousness that was light—exceptionally pure, exceptionally clear light, clear beyond imagination. I had accessed light many times before; the light is a signature of radically expanded divine states of consciousness. But when I talk about Diamond Luminosity, I mean a particular state: a hyper-clear state of consciousness. Because I know the Buddhist literature better than other traditions (at least the mystical side), I correlate it with what the Buddhists call Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality—the foundational metaphysical structure, the light out of which the Big Bang emerges and gives birth to the physical universe. So it doesn’t have anything to do with physical diamonds, but it does relate to what the Diamond Sutra points toward, and Vajrayana—vajra meaning diamond. Other traditions also speak about this diamond-esque luminosity, but I know it best from Buddhist sources. It seems to correlate with what’s described in the Tantras and in the Vadnais Sutras of the Dharmakaya. Beautiful.

> Just to add a little more about how I understand what happened in that 20-year journey—mind you, it would take all day to do it justice—the very short version is: in each one of those 73 journeys, the first two hours were, as you described in the book, sometimes exquisitely painful as you went through the difficult process of ego dissolution and beyond—letting go of any kind of identity, even as a human. And then what happened, as I recall, is that you broke out into what you have called the vast intelligences of the universe. Believe me, folks, this is no exaggeration—the kind of material that Chris brought back is absolutely stunning and absolutely relevant to what’s going on on the planet.

After ego-death, after the ocean of suffering, after archetypal and causal realities—about 15 years in—I had been given so many spiritual treasures that I felt existentially satisfied. I had experienced radical Shunyata—emptiness of self—oneness of all existence. Then I went through yet another death-rebirth cycle and accessed a dimension of light so pure and clear it stunned me. It became my sole objective to return.

Between those sessions were deep purification, more learning, more teaching.

> e sometimes draw premature conclusions about their true implications for the nature of the universe.
> Here’s why: towards the end of my LSD work—those last five years—I had several immersions into what I called the "diamond luminosity," a state beyond even merging with the divine. I'd go into it repeatedly, but in my 50th session, something new happened. I was as far out as I'd ever been—peaceful, merged with the light—when suddenly, everything pivoted. I saw a new reality, even further removed, and a beam of light hit me and utterly shattered me. This was a different order of light—beyond the diamond luminosity I’d spent 15 years reaching. I called it the absolute light. That was when I realized that these experiences aren't about achieving a final state; it's an infinite progression. I completely gave up the idea that you could ever reach the end.

> minosity that you began to experience in your sessions? Is it the same thing or something different?
Chris Bache:
I think it’s a variation of the same thing. The Diamond Luminosity I experienced is, I believe, a level of reality in the cosmos. In Buddhist terminology, I’d describe it as an extra-samsaric reality—beyond cyclic existence, beyond the Bardo. There are many layers of the Bardo—the low animal hell realms, the high deity realms—but the Diamond Luminosity is beyond all of those. There is a clear phenomenological difference between the high deity realms and then moving into the Diamond Luminosity, which is beyond all deities, archetypes, or any dimension we normally encounter.

> ook’s inner title is Diamonds from Heaven. Are those diamonds the blessing we get from this process?
Chris Bache
There are many blessings—insight, transformation, deepening—but “diamonds from heaven” refers to something specific. After about 15 years, having moved through ego death, collective species death, archetypal realities, and causal-level realities, I went through another death-rebirth and was catapulted into a dimension of pure light—crystalline, ultra-clear light. I’d experienced light before, as many psychedelic voyagers do, but this was different. When I call it diamond consciousness or diamond luminosity, I’m pointing to a particular quality of light: ultra, ultra clear—beyond imagination.

> d then you were led into the diamond luminosity and its discovery. Describe that transition, please.
Chris Bache
I have to back up a little. I went into archetypal reality—let’s skip over the details—and then through another death-and-rebirth process into what I came to call causal mind, a condition where everything is one: all the diversity of life pulsing as a single totality. It was an overwhelming, absorbing experience of fundamental oneness. My boundaries dissolved completely—not only personal boundaries. From this perspective, there were no boundaries anywhere in the universe; we are all aspects of this fundamental oneness. I experienced what the Buddhists call shunyata—emptiness, transparency. In another session I was taken into the cosmic, fertile void out of which the universe emerged, an experience of overwhelming cosmic love. That went on for a year—extraordinary blessings—and I was completely satisfied, philosophically and spiritually.

Chris Bache
What I share doesn’t come from an intellectual basis or books I’ve read—I wish I could give you footnotes and the documentation academics love. I have to speak only out of my spiritual experiences, my psychedelic experiences. Over the course of a long journey, I was plunged into a series of initiatory visionary experiences. What I shared just now is what was given to me, shown with consistency: that humanity is entering a critical time, a critically unstable bifurcation point; that the world is entering a global crisis driven by cascading ecological crises; that these crises would hit again and again, causing profound breakdown. Many wise people see it coming and fear an extinction event—that we won’t survive what’s ahead.

> ore, diamond light is of a different order entirely—ultra-clear, super-luminous, beyond imagination.
In the next four years and twenty-five sessions, I entered this diamond luminosity state only four times, each time separated by tremendous purification and healing. The 50th session was the deepest—an absorption into pure light, boundaries dissolved, happiness beyond description. In that state, something happened that altered my understanding of reality. My visual field pivoted, and in the distance, I perceived a reality as far beyond where I was as my current state was beyond Earth, time, and space. A ray of light from that further reality struck me and shattered me—I call it the Absolute Light. This made me realize that the journey is infinite; there is no final point, no end to God or the Divine. I learned there are depths within oneness, within the void—endless variations. I once believed you could ultimately reach an endpoint—a final destiny. But this experience showed me that the Divine is infinitely large, and the path is an endless progression.

> more importance than others. How are we to worship in light of the Diamond Luminosity—pun intended?
Chris Bache: I’ll tell you how I worship. I worship the universe—the diversity of life on this planet, the manifestation of galaxies, solar systems, star systems. I worship the manifest abundance and unfolding complexity of life itself, and I honor the hidden drivers of this reality. Science tells us that about 96% is dark energy and dark matter, which we’ve never seen and don’t really understand; only about 4% is visible in any realistic form. It’s not a stretch to think the universe is unfolding out of an extraordinarily complex and infinite reality. So I honor the universe as the manifest body of this intelligence, and I honor the intelligence that is manifesting as this body at the same time.

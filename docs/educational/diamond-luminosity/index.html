<blockquote>
<p>Christopher M. Bache is a scholar known for his exploration of consciousness and psychedelic experiences. His concept of "Diamond Luminosity" refers to profound states of awareness that transcend conventional perceptions of reality. This notion is situated within a broader context of spiritual and psychological transformation, drawing on various philosophical and religious frameworks. Bache's work invites a deeper understanding of the intersections between consciousness, experience, and existential inquiry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luminosity refer to actual diamonds?” Another viewer asks whether it’s related to the Diamond Sutra.
Chris Bache:
That’s not a silly question at all. A bit of background: “Diamond Luminosity” points to states of consciousness I entered in the last five years of my work. I had already gone through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal process and a really solid ego death. I had entered what I later called the ocean of suffering at the collective psyche level, gone into archetypal reality, causal-level reality—many adventures—and I felt philosophically satiated and complete. I was experiencing profound oneness with existence, touching the meta-cosmic void, standing under the waterfall of cosmic love. I was existentially very satisfied.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>minosity that you began to experience in your sessions? Is it the same thing or something different?
Chris Bache:
I think it’s a variation of the same thing. The Diamond Luminosity I experienced is, I believe, a level of reality in the cosmos. In Buddhist terminology, I’d describe it as an extra-samsaric reality—beyond cyclic existence, beyond the Bardo. There are many layers of the Bardo—the low animal hell realms, the high deity realms—but the Diamond Luminosity is beyond all of those. There is a clear phenomenological difference between the high deity realms and then moving into the Diamond Luminosity, which is beyond all deities, archetypes, or any dimension we normally encounter.</p>

<p>Diamond Luminosity, which is beyond all deities, archetypes, or any dimension we normally encounter.
When the soul congealed in my being in the Diamond Luminosity—when the soul exploded from my chest—it had that same quality of light as the Diamond Luminosity but at a slightly lower intensity. Let me back up. We experience light many times in psychedelic journeys. It’s common: going through ego death, entering light; entering collective dimensions, experiencing dimensions of light. I had known light many times. “Diamond Luminosity” is not just a fancy metaphor. I learned there are many degrees and dimensions of light, and the Diamond Luminosity is an exceptionally pure, exceptionally clear dimension of light. I think the diamond soul, as an assay light being, is a manifestation of this quality of light inside individuated existence. So on the one hand it’s the same, and on the other it’s a variation. I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily identical, but it’s very close.</p>

Chris Bache:
Yes. The day after, you’re still one foot in, one foot out—standing at the edge of the well. By playing the music while your cognitive capacities are back, you let your mind return to that territory and capture it.</p>

A question raised by several viewers relates to the way we titled this program, using your phrase “Diamond Luminosity.” One of our viewers, Celia Funk, asks, “This may be a silly question, but does the title Diamond Luminosity refer to actual diamonds?” Another viewer asks whether it’s related to the Diamond Sutra.</p>

<p>nd luminosity, I’m pointing to a particular quality of light: ultra, ultra clear—beyond imagination.
Over the last five years of my work—26 sessions—I was taken into diamond luminosity four times. Between those entries, there was lots of purification and many teachings, but those four immersions are the true “diamonds from heaven,” the most important takeaway. Looking to religious literature, the closest analogue I found is Buddhism’s Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality, the light out of which the Big Bang emerges. That is what I believe I experienced in diamond luminosity.</p>

Much of your cosmology feels Buddhist, though there are differences—especially around reincarnation, where the goal isn’t to enter nirvana and depart, but to continue evolving. Do you feel your journey confirms Buddhism, and where does it differ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ook’s inner title is Diamonds from Heaven. Are those diamonds the blessing we get from this process?
Chris Bache
There are many blessings—insight, transformation, deepening—but “diamonds from heaven” refers to something specific. After about 15 years, having moved through ego death, collective species death, archetypal realities, and causal-level realities, I went through another death-rebirth and was catapulted into a dimension of pure light—crystalline, ultra-clear light. I’d experienced light before, as many psychedelic voyagers do, but this was different. When I call it diamond consciousness or diamond luminosity, I’m pointing to a particular quality of light: ultra, ultra clear—beyond imagination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>d then you were led into the diamond luminosity and its discovery. Describe that transition, please.
Chris Bache
I have to back up a little. I went into archetypal reality—let’s skip over the details—and then through another death-and-rebirth process into what I came to call causal mind, a condition where everything is one: all the diversity of life pulsing as a single totality. It was an overwhelming, absorbing experience of fundamental oneness. My boundaries dissolved completely—not only personal boundaries. From this perspective, there were no boundaries anywhere in the universe; we are all aspects of this fundamental oneness. I experienced what the Buddhists call shunyata—emptiness, transparency. In another session I was taken into the cosmic, fertile void out of which the universe emerged, an experience of overwhelming cosmic love. That went on for a year—extraordinary blessings—and I was completely satisfied, philosophically and spiritually.</p>

<p>lse—what other scaffolds—do you want to put there before we explore the sense of diamond luminosity?
Chris Bache
What I share doesn’t come from an intellectual basis or books I’ve read—I wish I could give you footnotes and the documentation academics love. I have to speak only out of my spiritual experiences, my psychedelic experiences. Over the course of a long journey, I was plunged into a series of initiatory visionary experiences. What I shared just now is what was given to me, shown with consistency: that humanity is entering a critical time, a critically unstable bifurcation point; that the world is entering a global crisis driven by cascading ecological crises; that these crises would hit again and again, causing profound breakdown. Many wise people see it coming and fear an extinction event—that we won’t survive what’s ahead.</p>

<p>; archetypal mind—the greater real of archetypal reality; causal oneness—a benediction of blessings.
Diamond Luminosity is discussed in Chapter 10, the largest in the book—26 sessions, almost a third of the entire journey. Before I talk about Diamond Luminosity, I talk about the birth of the future human, a series of experiences that began during initiation into the universe and continued into the Diamond Luminosity work. At the end, in the last year, there was a final vision that became the capstone of the birth of the future human. It’s impossible to do more than touch on a few themes to give a sense of the trajectory—so first, let’s do that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ore, diamond light is of a different order entirely—ultra-clear, super-luminous, beyond imagination.
In the next four years and twenty-five sessions, I entered this diamond luminosity state only four times, each time separated by tremendous purification and healing. The 50th session was the deepest—an absorption into pure light, boundaries dissolved, happiness beyond description. In that state, something happened that altered my understanding of reality. My visual field pivoted, and in the distance, I perceived a reality as far beyond where I was as my current state was beyond Earth, time, and space. A ray of light from that further reality struck me and shattered me—I call it the Absolute Light. This made me realize that the journey is infinite; there is no final point, no end to God or the Divine. I learned there are depths within oneness, within the void—endless variations. I once believed you could ultimately reach an endpoint—a final destiny. But this experience showed me that the Divine is infinitely large, and the path is an endless progression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>more importance than others. How are we to worship in light of the Diamond Luminosity—pun intended?
Chris Bache: I’ll tell you how I worship. I worship the universe—the diversity of life on this planet, the manifestation of galaxies, solar systems, star systems. I worship the manifest abundance and unfolding complexity of life itself, and I honor the hidden drivers of this reality. Science tells us that about 96% is dark energy and dark matter, which we’ve never seen and don’t really understand; only about 4% is visible in any realistic form. It’s not a stretch to think the universe is unfolding out of an extraordinarily complex and infinite reality. So I honor the universe as the manifest body of this intelligence, and I honor the intelligence that is manifesting as this body at the same time.</p>

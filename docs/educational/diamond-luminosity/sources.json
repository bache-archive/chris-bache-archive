After going through yet one more intense cycle of death and rebirth, I was taken into a brilliantly clear, supremely luminous radiance. Buddhism calls this radiance *dharmakaya*—the Clear Light of Absolute Reality. I call it the domain of Diamond Luminosity. This Luminosity captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest in continuing to explore the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me. This was a different order of reality altogether. Its clarity was so overwhelming, its energy so pure that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions.",

It was perfectly focused power. I suddenly knew that all my experiences in space-time over all these centuries served the cultivation of this Diamond Energy.

I could not imagine anything more fulfilling or complete than the Pure Light of Diamond Luminosity. And indeed, I did find my personal stopping point here. But at the very moment of reaching this pinnacle, this session showed me that there are dimensions of existence beyond even this. I saw that there are more dimensions of Light than I will ever be able to explore in this lifetime, even using this powerful method. There is simply not enough time, and I do not have enough strength to touch them all. We are truly children waking in the arms of an infinite cosmos.",

An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering.

I had known light many times. “Diamond Luminosity” is not just a fancy metaphor. I learned there are many degrees and dimensions of light, and the Diamond Luminosity is an exceptionally pure, exceptionally clear dimension of light.

My visual field pivoted, and in the distance, I perceived a reality as far beyond where I was as my current state was beyond Earth, time, and space. A ray of light from that further reality struck me and shattered me—I call it the Absolute Light. This made me realize that the journey is infinite; there is no final point, no end to God or the Divine. I learned there are depths within oneness, within the void—endless variations. I once believed you could ultimately reach an endpoint—a final destiny. But this experience showed me that the Divine is infinitely large, and the path is an endless progression.",

I worship the universe—the diversity of life on this planet, the manifestation of galaxies, solar systems, star systems. I worship the manifest abundance and unfolding complexity of life itself, and I honor the hidden drivers of this reality. Science tells us that about 96% is dark energy and dark matter, which we’ve never seen and don’t really understand; only about 4% is visible in any realistic form. It’s not a stretch to think the universe is unfolding out of an extraordinarily complex and infinite reality. So I honor the universe as the manifest body of this intelligence, and I honor the intelligence that is manifesting as this body at the same time.",

Every time you go through death-rebirth, people often encounter light in many forms. I had encountered it at many levels. After ego-death, after the ocean of suffering, after archetypal and causal realities—about 15 years in—I had been given so many spiritual treasures that I felt existentially satisfied. I had experienced radical Shunyata—emptiness of self—oneness of all existence. Then I went through yet another death-rebirth cycle and accessed a dimension of light so pure and clear it stunned me. It became my sole objective to return.\n\nOnce you touch what I’m calling the diamond Luminosity, it’s so far beyond anything I’d previously touched that I lost interest in archetypal or causal realities. I wanted to get back there. It is breathtakingly pure, and the associated ecstasy is staggering. Over the next five years—26 sessions, one-third of my entire journey—I accessed it only four more times. Between those sessions were deep purification, more learning, more teaching.",

It is the pure light from which the universe arises and returns. It is Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. In between these four immersions, there were many intense episodes of cleansing and personal healing. In general, there were two movements during this four-year period: first, going deeper into Diamond Luminosity; then Diamond Luminosity began to crunch itself more deeply into my physical body. The turning point for this was Session 50. I only began to understand what was happening after the fact. I had no control over what was happening in the sessions; I went along with wherever the universe was taking me and only figured out afterward what had taken place. In Session 50, I was as deep into the universe as I ever went. I was in the clearest, most sublime state of Diamond Luminosity I had ever known. Then everything in my visual field pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw a reality far into the distance that looked like luminous galaxies. A ray of light from that reality hit me, and it absolutely shattered me. I call it the absolute light, just to give it a name. What it showed me is that the universe we explore in these deep states of consciousness is endless. I would never get to the end of the divine mind, the cosmic mind, even using this powerful method of exploration.",

I experienced all of my former lives coming into me very quickly. Tremendous work had been done earlier in the session, and I was in a state where I was integrating streams of consciousness from multiple lifetimes. It was like wrapping string around a kite spool—filaments of white light. They hit a critical mass and fused—these lives fused into a single energy entity. When they fused, there was an explosion of diamond light from my chest that catapulted me into a completely different state of consciousness. I was still an individual, but beyond any frame of reference I had known. I wasn’t Chris Bache; I was a being of which Chris Bache was a part, along with these other former lives. That’s what I came to call the birth of the diamond soul.",

On a specific note: why the word “diamond” for those realms?\nChris Bache: Having experienced the light itself, “diamond” felt like the most natural image. Perhaps I’m influenced by Vajrayana—the Diamond Way—in the background. The image isn’t uncommon in terma texts that try to describe subtle levels of consciousness, so it came organically from the experience.\n\nOn integration, I’m glad it’s getting more attention. We can blow through levels and have extraordinary experiences with increasing predictability, but internalizing them—really digesting them so they become part of your being—is a long process. I think we overemphasize the dying of seeing and underemphasize the dying of keeping.",

I’d pushed hard, thinking the purpose was to reach a final condition—to get home, to become one with the universe or the metacosmic void. I’d had many experiences of oneness and learned there are degrees of oneness; I’d experienced the primal void and learned there are degrees of the void. At the peak of diamond luminosity, resting intact in a deeply blissful state, my visual field pivoted 90 degrees. A circle opened, and in the far distance I saw a reality far beyond diamond luminosity—a domain of light. A ray of light came from that reality and hit me; it shattered me. It took minutes to recover. That’s when I understood it’s an infinite progression. We’ll never get to the end of it. Even with this aggressive mode of exploration, I’d never reach the end. The mind of the universe is too vast. There is a homecoming, yes, but the idea of an end that changes everything—I don’t think so. Oneness is beautiful and important, but even oneness does not exhaust what the universe has to teach.",

Then I’m dropped into this infinitely satisfying, clear Diamond Luminosity—what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. The second time I’m in that reality—the 50th session—I’m as deep into the universe as I’ve ever been. I couldn’t ask for anything more. Suddenly my visual field pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw a reality far, far in the distance—again, it looked like galaxies. Out of that reality, a beam of light came and hit me, and it absolutely shattered me. It was more powerful than even the Diamond Luminosity that had been my ultimate reality.

This domain captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest I had in exploring the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me. This was a different order of reality altogether. Its clarity was so overwhelming, its energy so pure, that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions.

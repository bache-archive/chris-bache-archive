A bit of background: “Diamond Luminosity” points to states of consciousness I entered in the last five years of my work. I had already gone through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal process and a really solid ego death. I had entered what I later called the ocean of suffering at the collective psyche level, gone into archetypal reality, causal-level reality—many adventures—and I felt philosophically satiated and complete. I was experiencing profound oneness with existence, touching the meta-cosmic void, standing under the waterfall of cosmic love. I was existentially very satisfied.",

It is the pure light from which the universe arises and returns. It is Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality. In between these four immersions, there were many intense episodes of cleansing and personal healing. In general, there were two movements during this four-year period: first, going deeper into Diamond Luminosity; then Diamond Luminosity began to crunch itself more deeply into my physical body. The turning point for this was Session 50. I only began to understand what was happening after the fact. I had no control over what was happening in the sessions; I went along with wherever the universe was taking me and only figured out afterward what had taken place. In Session 50, I was as deep into the universe as I ever went. I was in the clearest, most sublime state of Diamond Luminosity I had ever known. Then everything in my visual field pivoted 90 degrees, and I saw a reality far into the distance that looked like luminous galaxies. A ray of light from that reality hit me, and it absolutely shattered me. I call it the absolute light, just to give it a name. What it showed me is that the universe we explore in these deep states of consciousness is endless. I would never get to the end of the divine mind, the cosmic mind, even using this powerful method of exploration.",

I felt I had been drawn deep into the cosmic process, overwhelmed with cosmic love, taken into the fertile void beneath all physical existence. I didn’t know what was next, but there were still five years ahead. The Diamond Luminosity chapter gathers four years of work and 26 sessions—the most of any chapter. After yet one more intense death-and-rebirth, I was taken into what Buddhism calls Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality: a domain of consciousness of absolute, pure light. The most striking thing was how clear—clear beyond imagination—this domain was. Just touching it for a few minutes was life-transforming. It was beyond the species-mind, beyond archetypal reality, beyond any derivative of physical consciousness—into a hyper-clear, celestial state. Over the next four years, I entered this reality four times—only four out of 26 sessions took me deep into it. The session titles were Death State, Diamond Luminosity, The Universal Field of Light, and The Nature of Mind. In between, as you might imagine, there were many sessions of intense purification because this was a much more pure level of reality and required the purification of my physical and psychological system to stabilize consciousness there. Also scattered throughout, a great deal of personal healing took place—curious to me because I would have thought personal healing would have occurred earlier, but I came to understand why things unfolded in that order. The first two of these sessions took me deeper into Diamond Luminosity, peaking in the 50th session. The second two—60 and 66—saw Diamond Luminosity crunching deeper into my physical and psychological system, into my body.",

I’d pushed hard, thinking the purpose was to reach a final condition—to get home, to become one with the universe or the metacosmic void. I’d had many experiences of oneness and learned there are degrees of oneness; I’d experienced the primal void and learned there are degrees of the void. At the peak of diamond luminosity, resting intact in a deeply blissful state, my visual field pivoted 90 degrees. A circle opened, and in the far distance I saw a reality far beyond diamond luminosity—a domain of light. A ray of light came from that reality and hit me; it shattered me. It took minutes to recover. That’s when I understood it’s an infinite progression. We’ll never get to the end of it. Even with this aggressive mode of exploration, I’d never reach the end. The mind of the universe is too vast. There is a homecoming, yes, but the idea of an end that changes everything—I don’t think so.

As it turned out, LSD and the Mind of the Universe—what I prefer to call Diamonds from Heaven—was published exactly 20 years after I finished. So it was 20 years of exploration, followed by 20 years of digesting, reflecting, integrating, and finally telling the story.

I had accessed light many times before; the light is a signature of radically expanded divine states of consciousness. But when I talk about Diamond Luminosity, I mean a particular state: a hyper-clear state of consciousness. Because I know the Buddhist literature better than other traditions (at least the mystical side), I correlate it with what the Buddhists call Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality—the foundational metaphysical structure, the light out of which the Big Bang emerges and gives birth to the physical universe. So it doesn’t have anything to do with physical diamonds, but it does relate to what the Diamond Sutra points toward, and Vajrayana—vajra meaning diamond. Other traditions also speak about this diamond-esque luminosity, but I know it best from Buddhist sources. It seems to correlate with what’s described in the Tantras and in the Vadnais Sutras of the Dharmakaya. Beautiful.",

        "text": "ore, diamond light is of a different order entirely—ultra-clear, super-luminous, beyond imagination.\nIn the next four years and twenty-five sessions, I entered this diamond luminosity state only four times, each time separated by tremendous purification and healing. The 50th session was the deepest—an absorption into pure light, boundaries dissolved, happiness beyond description. In that state, something happened that altered my understanding of reality. My visual field pivoted, and in the distance, I perceived a reality as far beyond where I was as my current state was beyond Earth, time, and space. A ray of light from that further reality struck me and shattered me—I call it the Absolute Light. This made me realize that the journey is infinite; there is no final point, no end to God or the Divine. I learned there are depths within oneness, within the void—endless variations. I once believed you could ultimately reach an endpoint—a final destiny. But this experience showed me that the Divine is infinitely large, and the path is an endless progression.",

        "text": "more importance than others. How are we to worship in light of the Diamond Luminosity—pun intended?\nChris Bache: I’ll tell you how I worship. I worship the universe—the diversity of life on this planet, the manifestation of galaxies, solar systems, star systems. I worship the manifest abundance and unfolding complexity of life itself, and I honor the hidden drivers of this reality. Science tells us that about 96% is dark energy and dark matter, which we’ve never seen and don’t really understand; only about 4% is visible in any realistic form. It’s not a stretch to think the universe is unfolding out of an extraordinarily complex and infinite reality. So I honor the universe as the manifest body of this intelligence, and I honor the intelligence that is manifesting as this body at the same time.",

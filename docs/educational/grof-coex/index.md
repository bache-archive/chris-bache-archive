> This educational page explores the concepts of COEX systems and meta-COEX systems as developed by Stanislav Grof. These frameworks describe how both personal and collective experiences are organized within the psyche, emphasizing the thematic clusters of memories that share common emotional charges. The implications of these systems extend to understanding the interconnectedness of individual and collective trauma throughout human history.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §4 ¶4**

> To explain these patterns in his data, Grof introduced the concepts of COEX system and Basic Perinatal Matrix (BPM). A COEX system, short for “system of condensed experience,” is a specific constellation of memories (and fantasies) from many periods of an individual's life that share a common theme and are marked by a common emotional charge. For a simple analogy, imagine taking a novel and highlighting the protagonist’s many experiences in different colors according to their emotional content—red for anger, green for jealousy, yellow for fear, etc. If you were then to cut up the entire book and gather all the cuttings of each color into separate piles, each pile would represent a single COEX system. The surface layers of a COEX system are made up of more recent or superficial experiences of that particular emotion. As you move deeper into the system, the experiences tend to become older and more basic. At the center of each system is a core experience or set of experiences that represents the primary disturbance, the seed experience around which later experiences cluster.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §2 ¶6**

> The collective psyche appears to organize its memories in ways that parallel how the personal unconscious organizes its memories. Grof has demonstrated that our personal unconscious organizes its memories into *clusters of experience* that come from different periods of our life but share a common emotional theme. As we saw in chapter 2, he calls these clusters of condensed experience COEX systems. The psychedelic experiences presented in this chapter suggest that the collective unconscious organizes its vast store of memories in a similar fashion. It appears to gather the memories of humanity into *giant memory clusters* that come from different people and different historical periods but share a common emotional theme. I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems. The structure of a META-COEX system parallels the structure of a personal COEX system, but it operates on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness—the subtle level.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶4**

> The pulse of the life one is living in these hours is the pulse of human history. The COEX systems that are resolving themselves in these exercises are not personal complexes but META-COEX systems within the collective unconscious. The intelligence that initiates and guides this collective rebirth is not the individual’s higher self but something like the higher self of the human species, the archetypal intelligence that connects us to the Creative Intelligence of the universe.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶5**

> This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §10 ¶4**

> Like Grof, I will use these terms to identify states of consciousness without endorsing a specific model of spiritual development. While my psychedelic experiences unfolded in this general order, there were many variations along the way. I will also use these terms for the different levels of reality one becomes aware of through these states. That is, I accept the premise that subtle states of consciousness reveal subtle levels of reality, causal states reveal causal levels, and so on. This is the great value of entering these states, that through them we gain access to deeper dimensions of existence.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §2 ¶5**

> Grof’s understanding of these episodes is that they are clusters of memories in the collective unconscious that get pulled into one’s personal death-rebirth process at the perinatal level of consciousness. Because the perinatal dimension lies at the interface of personal and transpersonal consciousness, perinatal experience can weave together material from both the personal and the collective psyche. Grof believes that these episodes of collective suffering are essentially bleed-through from the collective unconscious because of their resonance to some aspect of personal ego-death. That is, he sees ego-death as being the core experience here, and these clusters of collective experience are drawn to this core because they parallel some aspect of egodeath. If this were an opera, ego-death would be singing lead and these collective experiences would be the chorus.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶17**

> Furthermore, Grof supports restricting the term perinatal to death-rebirth experiences that have strong fetal components. In a personal exchange with me on this topic in October 25, 2006, he wrote:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶2**

> In Grof’s model of the psyche, the perinatal domain is a level of consciousness that lies between the personal psyche and transpersonal levels of consciousness. It is both the basement of the personal unconscious and the doorway to spiritual states of awareness. Entering this domain triggers an extremely realistic confrontation with death that is often combined with reliving one’s birth and a variety of intense physical and emotional discharges. This existential confrontation with death and the limits of physical existence drives a fundamental question: Do our lives have any true meaning and purpose in the larger scheme of things, or are we just the random products of a blind and indifferent universe? Through systematically engaging these physical, psychological, and existential trials, one works through a series of core issues that eventually culminate in the complete collapse of one’s physical identity, followed by rebirth into spiritual reality.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §10 ¶3**

> I will follow Stan Grof in describing these platforms of experience as the *psychic*, *subtle*, and *causal* levels of consciousness. Ken Wilber first used these terms, together with *non-duality*, in *The Atman Project* (1980) to identify what he believed were the four stages of psycho-spiritual development. Drawing largely from Hindu and Buddhist sources, Wilber saw these four stages as evolutionary stepping-stones culminating in nondual spiritual realization. While referencing Wilber’s model, Grof does not use these terms to classify stages of spiritual development but rather to distinguish different states of consciousness that emerge in psychedelic and Holotropic Breathwork sessions. That is, his description is phenomenological rather than hierarchical. In this context, he distinguishes low and high psychic, subtle, and causal consciousness, giving examples of each drawn from his extensive archives.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶3**

> My experience of the perinatal domain closely mirrored Grof’s description of it in *Realms of the Human Unconscious*. When I entered this territory, my sessions became filled with fetal sensations, convulsive seizures, intense confrontations with the futility of existence, and many experiences of dying. I felt like a poster boy for the perinatal, and 1 deeply appreciated having Grof’s map of this confusing domain. During the first four sessions, these experiences had been relatively mild, but this changed dramatically in the 5th session.

> Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book *The Cosmic Game*. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §1 ¶11**

> What I experienced in this reality over the next ten sessions can be divided into two broad categories. The first set of experiences was more Platonic in nature and took place at what I would judge to be a higher subtle level. The second set was more Jungian in nature and took place at a lower subtle level. Both of these domains were archetypal but at different orders of scale. (For a short description of the concept of archetype and how I use this term, see the addendum at the end of this chapter, page 169.)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶10**

> Let me step back and say this more carefully. There is an important set of insights that emerges from gathering and analyzing the psychedelic experiences of large numbers of people, and this does require lifting experiences out of their original context. This has been one of Stan Grof’s invaluable contributions. By phenomenologically mapping the psychedelic experiences of hundreds if not thousands of people, Stan has established the ontological validity of the transpersonal territory. A different set of insights emerges when we follow one person through this territory. Without this collective database, the individual’s journey could be written off as being merely a private fantasy. Against the background of this collective database, however, tracking one person through this terrain brings out certain features of the psychedelic process more sharply: the multiple stages of initiation, the deepening spiral of death and rebirth, and the participatory dynamics of psychedelic disclosure. It is this work for which context is vital. Each of these perspectives complements and strengthens the other.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §6 ¶5**

> When I tried to make sense of these experiences, I first applied Grof’s perinatal theory to them, but while certain perinatal elements were present—nausea, a sense of entrapment, and release—many other elements were missing. There was no existential crisis, no confrontation with the meaninglessness of existence, and no physical seizures—all of which had been present in earlier sessions. And while the chaos and loss of coherence were reminiscent of ego-death, experientially, this particular chaos cut much deeper and marked a more fundamental unraveling than the death of my personal ego.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶3**

> Low-dose *psycholytic therapy* (75-300 mcg, typically around 200 mcg) activates the unconscious more gently, allowing a gradual unfolding of the psyche to take place. At this dosage level, the psyche releases its secrets and pains in layers. Emotional abreaction and other therapeutic mechanisms are intensified, calling for a flexible, dynamic engagement with the therapist. Grof’s early work at the Psychiatric Research Institute in Prague was primarily psycholytic therapy where sessions took place at one-week to two-week intervals and numbered between fifteen and one hundred sessions, averaging about forty sessions.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §5 ¶4**

> collective unconscious of the human species. Now I was above that field, at some higher archetypal level of reality. As many times before, I had the clear sensation that something was working with me to consolidate a clear position at this level so that I could receive instruction about how reality functions here. I felt myself to be “above the world,” in a region of intelligence that creates and sustains physical reality. I worked hard to establish greater clarity at this level by cooperating with the forces that surrounded and saturated me. Many insights came concerning the broad sweep of creation, how consciousness consolidates itself into matter deliberately and by stages.

> The second key is grounding. Without deep grounding, powerful experiences may come and go but amount to very little in the long run. First, there is the grounding achieved by establishing a strong set and setting on the day of a session. But deep transformation requires more than this. For enduring change to take root in our lives, we must also create a *container* for holding our experiences in between our sessions—for remembering them, pondering them, and putting their lessons into practice. If we don’t do this, we will be pulled to chase new experiences before we have fully digested the gifts we’ve already been given.

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)**

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶15 (6 · 1)**

> The proposal that death and rebirth take place at multiple levels of consciousness falls within the broad framework of Grof’s body of work, where he points to the numerous forms that death can take at transpersonal levels. In *The Ultimate Journey*, for example, he writes:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶22 (1)**

> Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a *cosmic communion* to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)**

> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.

> While Grof’s therapeutic protocol was the foundation of my psychedelic practice, I want to emphasize that I did this work not as a clinician but as a philosopher. I was not primarily seeking healing but an understanding of our universe. I wanted to experience the universe as deeply as I could and to know what I was at the core of my being, underneath all the layers of social and psychological conditioning. In this I saw myself pursuing a philosophical method that in modern times can be traced to William James’s *The Varieties of Religious Experience*. There in the context of his extensive analysis of spiritual experience, James describes his own self-experiments with nitrous oxide, which led to his famous observation:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)**

> LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶2 (1 · 5)**

> The choice to work with high doses turned out to have enormous consequences for what unfolded on this journey. It radically expanded not only the *depth of consciousness* reached but also the *breadth of consciousness* being activated in each session. It wasn’t simply a matter of eating the same karmic meal in fewer bites, as I had naively thought. Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web. Working at these levels changed not only how deep my experiences went but also who or what was actually having these experiences, what the “working unit” of experience was in a session. In these highly energized conditions, the size of the patient literally expands. What I mean by this will become clearer as we proceed.

> I love that description. What was it that so captured you about Grof’s work when you encountered it?
Chris Bache:
I immediately saw that if what he was saying was correct, it had enormous implications—for philosophy, which was my interest—not just for healing in clinical psychology. Here was a method that allowed deep, firsthand access to dimensions of consciousness and, through those dimensions, to dimensions of reality I had seen described in many spiritual literatures. This was a protocol that allowed people to be initiated, if only temporarily—what I call the path of temporary immersion. We have to be careful not to confuse a path of temporary immersion with what I would call the path of abiding presence, the more contemplative, meditational path. But this gave temporary access to states far beyond ordinary egoic awareness and far beyond space-time, to explore the deep structure of the universe itself.

> method is deeply interesting. Could you start by telling us what it is and what your work has been?
Chris Bache: What we share in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—with mind and soul. Now that we know how vast the physical universe is, the question becomes: how large and how deep is the mind of the universe? Just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I saw his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but to philosophy: he was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness, where the answers to the philosophical questions I carried from religious studies might lie.

Along the way, another transformation was pending. Chris read Stanislav Grof’s work on the use of psychedelics in psychotherapy, the non-dogmatic influences of Buddhism and Huston Smith’s perennialism. We know an integral soon followed. Chris ended his psychedelic explorations in 1999, and it wasn't until 2009 he wrote his first book, The Living Classroom. Here he shared how his expansive consciousness seemed to impact his students in what he called leaky boundaries. Again, those of us in integral recognize the psychoactive effect presencing has upon others. In 2019 he wrote LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven, some of which he'll share today and at the conference. Please give Chris Bache a warm San Diego Integral welcome.

> talking here. I hope the beautiful conversation we had brings you joy and wisdom, as it did for me.
To begin, could you give a general overview of your work as you discuss in the book—what it’s about and what your experiences really were?

Chris Bache
It all began right after I finished graduate school in 1978. I started my career as a professor of religious studies at Youngstown State University in Ohio, and I read Stan Grof’s first book, Realms of the Human Unconscious. I knew immediately this was critically important to my discipline, philosophy of religion. Stan outlined a methodology that allowed us to enter systematically and carefully into deep states of consciousness in which we could not only heal but also explore the deepest levels of mind—dropping into levels that go beyond the individual.

> ,” where I argue why these experiences are trustworthy, drawing on Ken Ring’s and Ken Wilber’s work.
All my work has come from this psychedelic journey: my first book on reincarnation, the second on trend in psychedelic theory, and The Living Classroom, which is coming out in a new edition now because they wanted psychedelics woven into the story. I had kept psychedelics out of The Living Classroom, but the truth is my students—who knew nothing about my psychedelic work—began to be impacted by it, and I had to learn a new way of teaching, developing what I call a quantum pedagogy. That’s the story, and I’ll stop here.

Tom Habib
We have a couple of questions before we go to breakout. One relates to your comments about the time period we’re in and the shift that’s occurring. It echoes Jean Gebser’s writing—and, in a different way, Nora Bateson’s questioning of stage models. Can you relate your experiences to Gebser’s view?

Chris Bache
I’ll make it easy for you: Gebser is one of those thinkers I know I should read and I haven’t, so there’s zero direct influence. Others will have to make those correlations.

What Stan found is that the psyche organizes its experiences—its memories—into clusters, thematically integrated clusters. All our experiences of abandonment, for example, form one tight experiential cluster he calls a COEX system—a system of condensed experience. Carl Jung called it a complex. We can have COEX systems around anger, fear, unrequited love. It’s like taking a novel, highlighting all the emotions in different colors, cutting up the novel, and putting all the green in one pile, all the yellow in another, all the red in another. When we encounter a problem in the psyche, we don’t encounter one instance of it; we encounter a cluster of experiences that date back sometimes to our birth and sometimes to former lives. We melt this problem in layers—the less problematic outer layers first—until we eventually get to the core, the seed problem, which may date from this lifetime, from birth, or from a former lifetime, and we dissolve the COEX system.

Andrew Holecek
Everybody, Andrew Holecek here, and I simply cannot contain my excitement about my guest today, Dr. Christopher Bache. With a brief introduction, we’re going to launch into what I believe will be a revelatory, provocative conversation. Chris, PhD, is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Medical Studies, an emeritus fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory board of Grof Legacy Training. Chris’s passion has been the study of the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. An award-winning teacher and international speaker, he has written four books: Life Cycles, a study of reincarnation in light of contemporary consciousness research; Dark Night, Early Dawn, a pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy and collective consciousness; The Living Classroom, an exploration of collective fields of consciousness and teaching; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe, the story of his 20-year journey with LSD. Chris is a father of three and lives in Weaverville, North Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy.

> Chris a chance to connect the living universe with the evolution of life through that living system.
Chris Bache
In that context, let me say something hard and consoling at the same time. From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.

> d reach the unfolding you did? I think what you did was incredibly brave, but is it possible to say?
Chris Bache:
I think it is, and Stan Grof’s work allows us to say it. He integrates the experiences of thousands of people; I’m only integrating mine, but my experiences fit comfortably within the larger matrix Grof has explored.

It’s a complicated answer because I want to say yes, and then immediately qualify it. These substances only amplify consciousness. They don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the mind that’s amplified is different. When an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward will, in the beginning, be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history. That’s why these substances are very helpful for healing: they evoke our unconscious, and therefore they evoke our problems—an individual experience.

> g from that into something else. Could you give a step-by-step of what the early stages looked like?
Chris Bache:
For about the first two years, I worked at what Stan Grof describes as the perinatal level of consciousness—the interface between personal egoic reality in space-time and early transpersonal consciousness. I had many experiences of reliving my own birth, experiences of death and dying, until, after about two and a half years, my personal reality was shattered. I died as the person I had known myself to be and was then reborn into a reality that radically transcended Chris Bache's reality. At that point, I was working deep within the collective unconscious, and the process began again.

> see if I got it right. Welcome to the people who are live and those who are going to join us later.
Chris Bache—the story I know is that he is now a retired professor of religious studies and philosophy from Ohio State University and Youngstown, Ohio. Early in his career he was always interested in mysticism and deep spiritual exploration, and he came upon the work of the legendary psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, who pioneered a protocol for working with high doses of LSD in particular. Chris undertook what turned out to be a 20-year journey of 73 high-dose LSD sessions following the Stan Grof protocol—sessions using 500 to 600 micrograms of LSD, which, for any of you not familiar with that calculation, is a high dose. The protocol involves working at home or in a safe, quiet space with headphones and a carefully curated playlist, eyeshades to block out the light so inner visions aren’t obstructed, and a qualified sitter. In Chris’s case, the sitter was a therapist who knew what she was doing. Generally, he did this on a Saturday, and the following day—again following the Grof protocol—he spent basically the whole day with the headphones on to trigger memories of what was playing when certain experiences and visions occurred, and then meticulously transcribed all that.

> X systems, our species gathers its trauma in vast collective COEX systems—what I call meta-matrices.
It took a long time to accept, because it sounded arrogant—as if my sessions were impacting humanity’s psyche. But it wasn’t that; it was simply following the natural deepening of the Death-Rebirth cycle: it churns at the personal level, then at the collective level. It culminated in an orgy of pain and the ocean of suffering, and then it spun me into archetypal reality. The ocean of suffering never returned after that point. There were further intense purifications, but that collective ordeal stopped, and I entered another cycle. My book Dark Night, Early Dawn explores why these collective experiences were showing up in what I thought was individual therapy.

Luc Briede-Cooper:
For those who don’t know, COEX—Stan Grof’s term—refers to systems of condensed experience: stacks of biographical traumas down to perinatal layers, and deeper into transpersonal material, all sharing a feeling tone.

> , but so many beings have had this intuition and bring different names to describe the future human.
Tasshin Fogleman:
There’s a term you borrow from Grof—COEX systems—and then you describe meta-COEX systems. A lot of what you’re talking about seems related. Could you verbally describe what those are and explain them a little?

[01:25:00](https://youtu.be/FEQ8ony19sk?t=5100)  — *Psychedelics and Cosmological Exploration with Chris Bache – Reach Truth Podcast* (2022-08-30) • 01:25:00

> may date from this lifetime, from birth, or from a former lifetime, and we dissolve the COEX system.
My experience is that the same is true for the collective psyche—that the mind of the universe and the mind of our species store history in massive thematic clusters. All the trauma associated with war; with drought and dying on the plains; male–female violence; patterns of violence, pain, suffering, fear of death—these don’t exist as free-floating private memories within the Bardo of our individual souls. The collective psyche aggregates its history into massive collective structures I call meta-COEX systems. So you have COEX systems within the personal psyche and meta-COEX systems within the collective psyche. I think when I was moved into the ocean of suffering, my system was engaging meta-COEX systems within the collective psyche and making some small contribution to removing those clusters—not all of them, certainly not any one all the way down. This is the work of generations, and all spiritual traditions—saints, sages, contemplatives—tap into levels of suffering that are not personal. That’s why bodhichitta—the will to save all sentient beings—is the only appropriate motivation for spiritual practice. You quickly realize this is not a private game. We’re in this together. It’s a collective evolutionary process.

> ego death, after which you move into consciousness beyond anything explainable by personal history.
At that point, instead of easier access to spiritual reality, the Death-Rebirth cycle repeated at a different level. I began having massive collective experiences—collective rage and anguish—for another two years, maybe 10 to 12 sessions. At first I thought this was just a deepening of personal ego death, but the content was so inherently collective, and it went on so long, that I concluded the “patient” wasn’t me personally; it had become my human family. I was being drawn into collective COEX systems that hold the pain and suffering of human history. Just as an individual psyche gathers trauma in COEX systems, our species gathers its trauma in vast collective COEX systems—what I call meta-matrices.

> ibal conflicts were implicitly present in what I was working with, but it wasn't explicitly present.
Stan has this concept of a COEX system, a system of condensed experience. I think the collective psyche also has these massive aggregates—these balls of collective experience—I call them the meta-matrices. They are the meta-COEX systems of the collective psyche that fuse multiple historical periods, cultures, and peoples' experience. Late in the series it became very clear to me that what I was engaging was memory—the living memory of trauma embedded in the collective psyche.

> rom Stan Grof: totally internalized sessions, lying down, eye shades, earphones, a sitter—the drill.
Unwisely, after three sessions I chose a protocol of very high doses of LSD because I was in a hurry. I thought this would get me where I wanted to go faster—that it was about personal awakening, personal enlightenment. I thought, it’ll be harder, but I’ll burn off my karma faster. Let’s put the pedal to the metal. That turned out to be wrong on many points. The goal was not personal enlightenment. If you work with very high doses in a carefully controlled setting and start shattering boundaries, within a few years you can find, as I did, that what’s driving your sessions is not your personal development or healing but a larger historical drama of our collective development. So much of the healing in my sessions was not about healing Chris Bache or even my soul; it was engaging and healing aspects of the human family—pains stored within the collective unconscious from all the wars, unhealed traumas, abuses, droughts, men-versus-women violence, race-versus-race violence, and so on. All that unresolved trauma accumulates in the human psyche.

> smology—which resonates deeply with the psychedelic cosmology Stan has described in The Cosmic Game.
Aurobindo’s vision is of a cascading involution of the Divine, generating multiple levels of reality—all divine, but within those levels, a descending scale of self-awareness of divinity, like a series of one-way mirrors: the divine looking down sees all; the divine looking up sees less. At the end of Dark Night, Early Dawn, I noted that, in a multilevel cosmology, a death-rebirth event can function as both liberation from below to above, and infusion from above to below. At the threshold, one can feel energy moving in both directions—death-rebirth as ascent and descent.

> and deeper into consciousness, that’s what I’m talking about. That’s what Stan Grof’s work explores.
First, a few words about the protocol I used, and then where this journey—told in LSD and the Mind of the Universe—went. Most of you who know Stan Grof’s work know the fundamental distinction in his methodology: low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy. Psycholytic therapy works with lower doses, perhaps 40 to 100 sessions, peeling the unconscious layer by layer, stripping down trauma, angst, pain bit by bit. At Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, they developed a different form: high-dose psychedelic therapy. The strategy was to take an overwhelming dose—about 500 micrograms—and blow through all levels of consciousness to try to trigger a near-death experience. They worked with terminally ill cancer patients, hoping to provoke a confrontation with the universe that would give a glimpse of where they were going and reduce death anxiety—and they succeeded.

> ciousness I entered in these transformational exercises expanded with the power of the state itself.
I worked in standard Grofian protocol: totally isolated from the world with a sitter—a trained clinical psychologist—at home in a controlled environment, completely internally focused, no contact with the outside world, amplifying the states with carefully selected music designed to empower the state of consciousness. At these levels, you basically shatter your mind; it dissolves into subtler and subtler aspects of reality. It became a systematic exploration of what I think of as the mind of the universe. I hesitate to call it “the divine,” though sometimes I do, because “divine” carries so much cultural baggage. I kept very careful records for 20 years, then digested the experiences for another 20, because these are not immediately transparent. They’re complex, interwoven, involving many levels of reality orchestrated in tidal surges of state.

> tenment. These two categories—the therapeutic and the spiritual awakening—dominate discussion today.
My work is different. I was trained as a philosopher of religion. I’m not a therapist or psychologist. I was interested in the philosophical potential of psychedelics. So my work falls into a third category: cosmological exploration—not healing, not primarily aiming at awakening, but using deep non-ordinary states to explore the deep structure of reality.

My work derives from Stan Grof. Just out of graduate school, I encountered Stan’s Realms of the Human Unconscious and his manual LSD Psychotherapy, followed by a dozen or more important books. In those early works, Stan differentiates between low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy—very different regimens. Psycholytic heals the unconscious layer by layer; psychedelic aims for a breakthrough. At Spring Grove Hospital they worked with terminally ill patients, trying to trigger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going when they died. But psychedelic therapy was limited to three sessions.

> lective psyche, into archetypal reality—each requires a different pattern of dying and being reborn.
I use Stan Grof’s categories—psychic (high/low), subtle (high/low), causal. They’re convenient but necessarily rough; how can six categories capture the full spectrum of divine experience? They’re useful to mark transitions on this journey. These cycles are like tori: you break through, expand into a new level, gather in, blow through to another level, stabilize competencies in that state, gather again, and then, if you follow the process, another death-rebirth into a deeper level.

One way I image this is with a nuclear explosion—not to dwell on the horror it represents, but to make a point: deep death-rebirth shatters everything you’ve known and drops you deeper into the universe, revealing levels previously outside awareness. In an explosion, deeper atmospheric layers become visible; likewise, deep psychedelic work brings levels into awareness that were always there. Dissolve the dualism in that image: you’re not separate from the strata you enter; you dissolve into that field. We’re not talking about bombs; we’re talking about the cosmos exploring itself.

> with you as well, and I think you looked to Stanislav Grof for how to go about that, is that right?
Chris Bache:
Stan’s work is so formidable, and his intellectual synthesis of so many traditions is so important, that he became my foundation for doing this work. Remember, I was doing this in Ohio, far from San Francisco. I wasn’t part of a psychedelic community or an ayahuasca group going to Peru to work with indigenous shamans. I was really working alone, and I adopted the protocol Stan outlined in his book LSD Psychotherapy (1980) very early on.

> stand why it hurts so much, because you’re going beyond the edge of the maps of the personal psyche.
If you focus with that intent, something exciting opens up. You not only have the opportunity to heal the knots locked in your heart from however many incarnations you’ve had, but as those knots are healed and unlocked, your receptivity to larger fields of consciousness—which are always there—increases. That, I think, is worth a lot of concerts.

Emmy Vadnais:
Chris, can you expand on what your session structures were like? Somebody commented after our conversation asking, “Why didn’t he just go out and hang in the mountains and nature?” You had somebody there with you as well, and I think you looked to Stanislav Grof for how to go about that, is that right?

> ences were. It was a deep excursion in cosmology 101: how the universe works at a fundamental level.
When the ocean of suffering culminated in the 24th session—healing the collective wound—there was an orgy of feeding on the pain that reached a culmination, and I was spun into a level of reality I came to understand as archetypal reality. I discuss this in the chapter The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality. It lasted about 11 sessions over one and a half years. Every time I entered, I encountered something more real than space-time—ancient beyond imagination, with time working at a completely different scale. I felt like Plato’s prisoner climbing out of the cave into a more real level of reality.

Chris Bache:
…shared in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—infused with mind and soul. And, of course, now we know how vast the physical universe is, and the question becomes: how large is the mind of the universe? How deep is it?

I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.

> meone used a similar method, they would reach the unfolding you did? Or is that not possible to say?
Chris Bache: I think it is possible to say—Stan Grof’s work allows us to say it. He’s integrating the experiences of thousands of people; I’m integrating my own. My experiences fit within the larger matrix his work has explored. It’s a complicated answer, because on one hand I want to say yes, and on the other I must qualify it. These substances amplify consciousness; they don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the amplified mind is different, and when an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward initially will be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history. That’s why these substances are helpful for healing: they evoke our unconscious and therefore our problems—an individual experience.

> edelics is about.

Ryan Kemp
Would you describe that as what Jung termed the collective unconscious?
Chris Bache
The collective unconscious is a stratum of consciousness below the personal unconscious. In Jung’s model, when we go below our conscious mind, we first encounter our personal unconscious. If you go deeper, you enter a stream of awareness shared by all human beings of your species—Jung’s collective psyche. Deeper still, you can enter broader streams—what some would call global consciousness—and then levels that go beyond space-time altogether: archetypal levels, complete states of dissolving into non-duality and what might be called causal oneness, and deeper states even than that. It’s a long journey with many levels of exploration along the way.

Ryan Kemp
So, as in Jung and in many spiritual and religious texts, we have our personal, individual mind, but the universe itself is a mind, a oneness of its own. Is that correct?

Gebser presents a phenomenology of consciousness—an archaeology of meaning-making—through works of art, literature, the evolution of language and etymology. Even in our language there’s a processual movement from what he calls sidereal, nighttime dimensions of consciousness into the waking. He carefully describes how human consciousness moved from magical and mythical forms or structures into the waking Apollonian, discerning, ratio-oriented, secular age. There are gains and losses. A nuanced, nonlinear approach that encourages us to explore these modes in ourselves helps make them concrete rather than abstract—to live the magic and the mythic again in some capacity, not merely acknowledge them.

The first chapter—crossing the perinatal plane—is the easiest to summarize, probably because it’s the one most people know from Grof’s writing. You relive fetal experiences, your time in the womb, birth itself, and many variations of death and rebirth. For me, moving through this level took about two years and ten sessions. In my ninth and tenth sessions, the universe just snapped me like a twig in my experience of ego death. The ego, in the end, was not very difficult to dismantle. The universe shattered me by turning me into the opposite of everything I’d known myself to be. I entered the day as a white, middle-class, highly educated philosopher focused on questions of existence, and those aspects were all reversed. For hours, I experienced the lives of women—hundreds of women—from around the world, women of color, women who were poor or had no interest in philosophy. I became all of those beings. I was completely terrified; it was, for me as a male philosopher, the perfect hell. There’s nothing wrong with being a woman or being poor or being disinterested in philosophy; the core issue was my identification with being male, with being middle class. That’s what the universe needed to break in me. The message wasn’t just to recall past lives as women—I’ve known I had those—but rather that, where I was going, gender doesn’t exist. I had to let go.

Personally: I was a brand-new professor, fresh out of graduate school, when I read Stan Grof’s work. I immediately felt I saw my life’s vocation. I had to do this work. It had been made illegal in 1970. This was 1978. I loved teaching and didn’t want to lose my job, so I developed a sideline to my career. I was an academic—teaching at the university, sitting on committees, writing papers—but in my nighttime job I began a systematic course using a psychedelic protocol I inherited from Stan Grof: totally internalized sessions, lying down, eye shades, earphones, a sitter—the drill.

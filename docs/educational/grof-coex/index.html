      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §4 ¶4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A COEX system, short for “system of condensed experience,” is a specific constellation of memories (and fantasies) from many periods of an individual’s life that share a common theme and are marked by a common emotional charge. … At the center of each system is a core experience or set of experiences that represents the primary disturbance, the seed experience around which later experiences cluster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.4 §2 ¶6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collective psyche appears to organize its memories in ways that parallel how the personal unconscious organizes its memories. … It appears to gather the memories of humanity into <em>giant memory clusters</em> that come from different people and different historical periods but share a common emotional theme. I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. … In this setting, an individual seems able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system is essentially the same as engaging a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness.</p>

<p>“What Stan found is that the psyche organizes its experiences—its memories—into clusters, thematically integrated clusters.… We melt this problem in layers—the less problematic outer layers first—until we eventually get to the core.”<br />

<p>“I read Stan Grof’s <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em> and my life pivoted. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay.”<br />

<p>“Our species gathers its trauma in vast collective COEX systems—what I call meta-matrices.… It took a long time to accept, because it sounded arrogant—as if my sessions were impacting humanity’s psyche—but it was simply the natural deepening of the Death-Rebirth cycle.”<br />

<p>“For about the first two years I worked at what Stan Grof describes as the perinatal level of consciousness—the interface between personal egoic reality and early transpersonal consciousness.… I died as the person I had known myself to be.”<br />

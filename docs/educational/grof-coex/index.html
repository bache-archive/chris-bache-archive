<p>This educational page explores the concepts of COEX systems and meta-COEX systems, as developed by Stanislav Grof. These frameworks describe how both individual and collective psyches organize memories and experiences around common emotional themes. The discussion highlights the parallels between personal and collective trauma, emphasizing the significance of these systems in understanding human consciousness and historical memory.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §4 ¶4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To explain these patterns in his data, Grof introduced the concepts of COEX system and Basic Perinatal Matrix (BPM). A COEX system, short for “system of condensed experience,” is a specific constellation of memories (and fantasies) from many periods of an individual's life that share a common theme and are marked by a common emotional charge. For a simple analogy, imagine taking a novel and highlighting the protagonist’s many experiences in different colors according to their emotional content—red for anger, green for jealousy, yellow for fear, etc. If you were then to cut up the entire book and gather all the cuttings of each color into separate piles, each pile would represent a single COEX system. The surface layers of a COEX system are made up of more recent or superficial experiences of that particular emotion. As you move deeper into the system, the experiences tend to become older and more basic. At the center of each system is a core experience or set of experiences that represents the primary disturbance, the seed experience around which later experiences cluster.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §2 ¶6</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The collective psyche appears to organize its memories in ways that parallel how the personal unconscious organizes its memories. Grof has demonstrated that our personal unconscious organizes its memories into <em>clusters of experience</em> that come from different periods of our life but share a common emotional theme. As we saw in chapter 2, he calls these clusters of condensed experience COEX systems. The psychedelic experiences presented in this chapter suggest that the collective unconscious organizes its vast store of memories in a similar fashion. It appears to gather the memories of humanity into <em>giant memory clusters</em> that come from different people and different historical periods but share a common emotional theme. I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems. The structure of a META-COEX system parallels the structure of a personal COEX system, but it operates on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness—the subtle level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pulse of the life one is living in these hours is the pulse of human history. The COEX systems that are resolving themselves in these exercises are not personal complexes but META-COEX systems within the collective unconscious. The intelligence that initiates and guides this collective rebirth is not the individual’s higher self but something like the higher self of the human species, the archetypal intelligence that connects us to the Creative Intelligence of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §10 ¶4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like Grof, I will use these terms to identify states of consciousness without endorsing a specific model of spiritual development. While my psychedelic experiences unfolded in this general order, there were many variations along the way. I will also use these terms for the different levels of reality one becomes aware of through these states. That is, I accept the premise that subtle states of consciousness reveal subtle levels of reality, causal states reveal causal levels, and so on. This is the great value of entering these states, that through them we gain access to deeper dimensions of existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §2 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grof’s understanding of these episodes is that they are clusters of memories in the collective unconscious that get pulled into one’s personal death-rebirth process at the perinatal level of consciousness. Because the perinatal dimension lies at the interface of personal and transpersonal consciousness, perinatal experience can weave together material from both the personal and the collective psyche. Grof believes that these episodes of collective suffering are essentially bleed-through from the collective unconscious because of their resonance to some aspect of personal ego-death. That is, he sees ego-death as being the core experience here, and these clusters of collective experience are drawn to this core because they parallel some aspect of egodeath. If this were an opera, ego-death would be singing lead and these collective experiences would be the chorus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Grof supports restricting the term perinatal to death-rebirth experiences that have strong fetal components. In a personal exchange with me on this topic in October 25, 2006, he wrote:</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Grof’s model of the psyche, the perinatal domain is a level of consciousness that lies between the personal psyche and transpersonal levels of consciousness. It is both the basement of the personal unconscious and the doorway to spiritual states of awareness. Entering this domain triggers an extremely realistic confrontation with death that is often combined with reliving one’s birth and a variety of intense physical and emotional discharges. This existential confrontation with death and the limits of physical existence drives a fundamental question: Do our lives have any true meaning and purpose in the larger scheme of things, or are we just the random products of a blind and indifferent universe? Through systematically engaging these physical, psychological, and existential trials, one works through a series of core issues that eventually culminate in the complete collapse of one’s physical identity, followed by rebirth into spiritual reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §10 ¶3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will follow Stan Grof in describing these platforms of experience as the <em>psychic</em>, <em>subtle</em>, and <em>causal</em> levels of consciousness. Ken Wilber first used these terms, together with <em>non-duality</em>, in <em>The Atman Project</em> (1980) to identify what he believed were the four stages of psycho-spiritual development. Drawing largely from Hindu and Buddhist sources, Wilber saw these four stages as evolutionary stepping-stones culminating in nondual spiritual realization. While referencing Wilber’s model, Grof does not use these terms to classify stages of spiritual development but rather to distinguish different states of consciousness that emerge in psychedelic and Holotropic Breathwork sessions. That is, his description is phenomenological rather than hierarchical. In this context, he distinguishes low and high psychic, subtle, and causal consciousness, giving examples of each drawn from his extensive archives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My experience of the perinatal domain closely mirrored Grof’s description of it in <em>Realms of the Human Unconscious</em>. When I entered this territory, my sessions became filled with fetal sensations, convulsive seizures, intense confrontations with the futility of existence, and many experiences of dying. I felt like a poster boy for the perinatal, and 1 deeply appreciated having Grof’s map of this confusing domain. During the first four sessions, these experiences had been relatively mild, but this changed dramatically in the 5th session.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶21</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book <em>The Cosmic Game</em>. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §1 ¶11</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I experienced in this reality over the next ten sessions can be divided into two broad categories. The first set of experiences was more Platonic in nature and took place at what I would judge to be a higher subtle level. The second set was more Jungian in nature and took place at a lower subtle level. Both of these domains were archetypal but at different orders of scale. (For a short description of the concept of archetype and how I use this term, see the addendum at the end of this chapter, page 169.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶10</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me step back and say this more carefully. There is an important set of insights that emerges from gathering and analyzing the psychedelic experiences of large numbers of people, and this does require lifting experiences out of their original context. This has been one of Stan Grof’s invaluable contributions. By phenomenologically mapping the psychedelic experiences of hundreds if not thousands of people, Stan has established the ontological validity of the transpersonal territory. A different set of insights emerges when we follow one person through this territory. Without this collective database, the individual’s journey could be written off as being merely a private fantasy. Against the background of this collective database, however, tracking one person through this terrain brings out certain features of the psychedelic process more sharply: the multiple stages of initiation, the deepening spiral of death and rebirth, and the participatory dynamics of psychedelic disclosure. It is this work for which context is vital. Each of these perspectives complements and strengthens the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §6 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I tried to make sense of these experiences, I first applied Grof’s perinatal theory to them, but while certain perinatal elements were present—nausea, a sense of entrapment, and release—many other elements were missing. There was no existential crisis, no confrontation with the meaninglessness of existence, and no physical seizures—all of which had been present in earlier sessions. And while the chaos and loss of coherence were reminiscent of ego-death, experientially, this particular chaos cut much deeper and marked a more fundamental unraveling than the death of my personal ego.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Low-dose <em>psycholytic therapy</em> (75-300 mcg, typically around 200 mcg) activates the unconscious more gently, allowing a gradual unfolding of the psyche to take place. At this dosage level, the psyche releases its secrets and pains in layers. Emotional abreaction and other therapeutic mechanisms are intensified, calling for a flexible, dynamic engagement with the therapist. Grof’s early work at the Psychiatric Research Institute in Prague was primarily psycholytic therapy where sessions took place at one-week to two-week intervals and numbered between fifteen and one hundred sessions, averaging about forty sessions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>collective unconscious of the human species. Now I was above that field, at some higher archetypal level of reality. As many times before, I had the clear sensation that something was working with me to consolidate a clear position at this level so that I could receive instruction about how reality functions here. I felt myself to be “above the world,” in a region of intelligence that creates and sustains physical reality. I worked hard to establish greater clarity at this level by cooperating with the forces that surrounded and saturated me. Many insights came concerning the broad sweep of creation, how consciousness consolidates itself into matter deliberately and by stages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second key is grounding. Without deep grounding, powerful experiences may come and go but amount to very little in the long run. First, there is the grounding achieved by establishing a strong set and setting on the day of a session. But deep transformation requires more than this. For enduring change to take root in our lives, we must also create a <em>container</em> for holding our experiences in between our sessions—for remembering them, pondering them, and putting their lessons into practice. If we don’t do this, we will be pulled to chase new experiences before we have fully digested the gifts we’ve already been given.</p>

<p>X systems, our species gathers its trauma in vast collective COEX systems—what I call meta-matrices.
It took a long time to accept, because it sounded arrogant—as if my sessions were impacting humanity’s psyche. But it wasn’t that; it was simply following the natural deepening of the Death-Rebirth cycle: it churns at the personal level, then at the collective level. It culminated in an orgy of pain and the ocean of suffering, and then it spun me into archetypal reality. The ocean of suffering never returned after that point. There were further intense purifications, but that collective ordeal stopped, and I entered another cycle. My book Dark Night, Early Dawn explores why these collective experiences were showing up in what I thought was individual therapy.</p>

<p>Luc Briede-Cooper:
For those who don’t know, COEX—Stan Grof’s term—refers to systems of condensed experience: stacks of biographical traumas down to perinatal layers, and deeper into transpersonal material, all sharing a feeling tone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>may date from this lifetime, from birth, or from a former lifetime, and we dissolve the COEX system.
My experience is that the same is true for the collective psyche—that the mind of the universe and the mind of our species store history in massive thematic clusters. All the trauma associated with war; with drought and dying on the plains; male–female violence; patterns of violence, pain, suffering, fear of death—these don’t exist as free-floating private memories within the Bardo of our individual souls. The collective psyche aggregates its history into massive collective structures I call meta-COEX systems. So you have COEX systems within the personal psyche and meta-COEX systems within the collective psyche. I think when I was moved into the ocean of suffering, my system was engaging meta-COEX systems within the collective psyche and making some small contribution to removing those clusters—not all of them, certainly not any one all the way down. This is the work of generations, and all spiritual traditions—saints, sages, contemplatives—tap into levels of suffering that are not personal. That’s why bodhichitta—the will to save all sentient beings—is the only appropriate motivation for spiritual practice. You quickly realize this is not a private game. We’re in this together. It’s a collective evolutionary process.</p>

<p>ego death, after which you move into consciousness beyond anything explainable by personal history.
At that point, instead of easier access to spiritual reality, the Death-Rebirth cycle repeated at a different level. I began having massive collective experiences—collective rage and anguish—for another two years, maybe 10 to 12 sessions. At first I thought this was just a deepening of personal ego death, but the content was so inherently collective, and it went on so long, that I concluded the “patient” wasn’t me personally; it had become my human family. I was being drawn into collective COEX systems that hold the pain and suffering of human history. Just as an individual psyche gathers trauma in COEX systems, our species gathers its trauma in vast collective COEX systems—what I call meta-matrices.</p>

<p>ibal conflicts were implicitly present in what I was working with, but it wasn't explicitly present.
Stan has this concept of a COEX system, a system of condensed experience. I think the collective psyche also has these massive aggregates—these balls of collective experience—I call them the meta-matrices. They are the meta-COEX systems of the collective psyche that fuse multiple historical periods, cultures, and peoples' experience. Late in the series it became very clear to me that what I was engaging was memory—the living memory of trauma embedded in the collective psyche.</p>

<p>rom Stan Grof: totally internalized sessions, lying down, eye shades, earphones, a sitter—the drill.
Unwisely, after three sessions I chose a protocol of very high doses of LSD because I was in a hurry. I thought this would get me where I wanted to go faster—that it was about personal awakening, personal enlightenment. I thought, it’ll be harder, but I’ll burn off my karma faster. Let’s put the pedal to the metal. That turned out to be wrong on many points. The goal was not personal enlightenment. If you work with very high doses in a carefully controlled setting and start shattering boundaries, within a few years you can find, as I did, that what’s driving your sessions is not your personal development or healing but a larger historical drama of our collective development. So much of the healing in my sessions was not about healing Chris Bache or even my soul; it was engaging and healing aspects of the human family—pains stored within the collective unconscious from all the wars, unhealed traumas, abuses, droughts, men-versus-women violence, race-versus-race violence, and so on. All that unresolved trauma accumulates in the human psyche.</p>

<p>smology—which resonates deeply with the psychedelic cosmology Stan has described in The Cosmic Game.
Aurobindo’s vision is of a cascading involution of the Divine, generating multiple levels of reality—all divine, but within those levels, a descending scale of self-awareness of divinity, like a series of one-way mirrors: the divine looking down sees all; the divine looking up sees less. At the end of Dark Night, Early Dawn, I noted that, in a multilevel cosmology, a death-rebirth event can function as both liberation from below to above, and infusion from above to below. At the threshold, one can feel energy moving in both directions—death-rebirth as ascent and descent.</p>

<p>and deeper into consciousness, that’s what I’m talking about. That’s what Stan Grof’s work explores.
First, a few words about the protocol I used, and then where this journey—told in LSD and the Mind of the Universe—went. Most of you who know Stan Grof’s work know the fundamental distinction in his methodology: low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy. Psycholytic therapy works with lower doses, perhaps 40 to 100 sessions, peeling the unconscious layer by layer, stripping down trauma, angst, pain bit by bit. At Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, they developed a different form: high-dose psychedelic therapy. The strategy was to take an overwhelming dose—about 500 micrograms—and blow through all levels of consciousness to try to trigger a near-death experience. They worked with terminally ill cancer patients, hoping to provoke a confrontation with the universe that would give a glimpse of where they were going and reduce death anxiety—and they succeeded.</p>

<p>ciousness I entered in these transformational exercises expanded with the power of the state itself.
I worked in standard Grofian protocol: totally isolated from the world with a sitter—a trained clinical psychologist—at home in a controlled environment, completely internally focused, no contact with the outside world, amplifying the states with carefully selected music designed to empower the state of consciousness. At these levels, you basically shatter your mind; it dissolves into subtler and subtler aspects of reality. It became a systematic exploration of what I think of as the mind of the universe. I hesitate to call it “the divine,” though sometimes I do, because “divine” carries so much cultural baggage. I kept very careful records for 20 years, then digested the experiences for another 20, because these are not immediately transparent. They’re complex, interwoven, involving many levels of reality orchestrated in tidal surges of state.</p>

<p>tenment. These two categories—the therapeutic and the spiritual awakening—dominate discussion today.
My work is different. I was trained as a philosopher of religion. I’m not a therapist or psychologist. I was interested in the philosophical potential of psychedelics. So my work falls into a third category: cosmological exploration—not healing, not primarily aiming at awakening, but using deep non-ordinary states to explore the deep structure of reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My work derives from Stan Grof. Just out of graduate school, I encountered Stan’s Realms of the Human Unconscious and his manual LSD Psychotherapy, followed by a dozen or more important books. In those early works, Stan differentiates between low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy—very different regimens. Psycholytic heals the unconscious layer by layer; psychedelic aims for a breakthrough. At Spring Grove Hospital they worked with terminally ill patients, trying to trigger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going when they died. But psychedelic therapy was limited to three sessions.</p>

<p>lective psyche, into archetypal reality—each requires a different pattern of dying and being reborn.
I use Stan Grof’s categories—psychic (high/low), subtle (high/low), causal. They’re convenient but necessarily rough; how can six categories capture the full spectrum of divine experience? They’re useful to mark transitions on this journey. These cycles are like tori: you break through, expand into a new level, gather in, blow through to another level, stabilize competencies in that state, gather again, and then, if you follow the process, another death-rebirth into a deeper level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One way I image this is with a nuclear explosion—not to dwell on the horror it represents, but to make a point: deep death-rebirth shatters everything you’ve known and drops you deeper into the universe, revealing levels previously outside awareness. In an explosion, deeper atmospheric layers become visible; likewise, deep psychedelic work brings levels into awareness that were always there. Dissolve the dualism in that image: you’re not separate from the strata you enter; you dissolve into that field. We’re not talking about bombs; we’re talking about the cosmos exploring itself.</p>

Stan’s work is so formidable, and his intellectual synthesis of so many traditions is so important, that he became my foundation for doing this work. Remember, I was doing this in Ohio, far from San Francisco. I wasn’t part of a psychedelic community or an ayahuasca group going to Peru to work with indigenous shamans.

If you focus with that intent, something exciting opens up.

When the ocean of suffering culminated in the 24th session—healing the collective wound—there was an orgy of feeding on the pain that reached a culmination, and I was spun into a level of reality I came to understand as archetypal reality. I discuss this in the chapter The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality. It lasted about 11 sessions over one and a half years. Every time I entered, I encountered something more real than space-time—ancient beyond imagination, with time working at a completely different scale. I felt like Plato’s prisoner climbing out of the cave into a more real level of reality.</p>

<p>I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>meone used a similar method, they would reach the unfolding you did? Or is that not possible to say?
Chris Bache: I think it is possible to say—Stan Grof’s work allows us to say it. He’s integrating the experiences of thousands of people; I’m integrating my own. My experiences fit within the larger matrix his work has explored. It’s a complicated answer, because on one hand I want to say yes, and on the other I must qualify it. These substances amplify consciousness; they don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the amplified mind is different, and when an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward initially will be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history. That’s why these substances are helpful for healing: they evoke our unconscious and therefore our problems—an individual experience.</p>

Would you describe that as what Jung termed the collective unconscious?
Chris Bache
The collective unconscious is a stratum of consciousness below the personal unconscious. In Jung’s model, when we go below our conscious mind, we first encounter our personal unconscious. If you go deeper, you enter a stream of awareness shared by all human beings of your species—Jung’s collective psyche. Deeper still, you can enter broader streams—what some would call global consciousness—and then levels that go beyond space-time altogether: archetypal levels, complete states of dissolving into non-duality and what might be called causal oneness, and deeper states even than that. It’s a long journey with many levels of exploration along the way.</p>

So, as in Jung and in many spiritual and religious texts, we have our personal, individual mind, but the universe itself is a mind, a oneness of its own. Is that correct?</p>

<p>ut a decade, and I’m planning to do my PhD at CIS—good to see Christopher here with the PCC program.
Gebser presents a phenomenology of consciousness—an archaeology of meaning-making—through works of art, literature, the evolution of language and etymology. Even in our language there’s a processual movement from what he calls sidereal, nighttime dimensions of consciousness into the waking. He carefully describes how human consciousness moved from magical and mythical forms or structures into the waking Apollonian, discerning, ratio-oriented, secular age. There are gains and losses. A nuanced, nonlinear approach that encourages us to explore these modes in ourselves helps make them concrete rather than abstract—to live the magic and the mythic again in some capacity, not merely acknowledge them.</p>

<p>ducing a typical session day—but these are the key sections carrying the content of the experiences.
The first chapter—crossing the perinatal plane—is the easiest to summarize, probably because it’s the one most people know from Grof’s writing. You relive fetal experiences, your time in the womb, birth itself, and many variations of death and rebirth. For me, moving through this level took about two years and ten sessions. In my ninth and tenth sessions, the universe just snapped me like a twig in my experience of ego death. The ego, in the end, was not very difficult to dismantle. The universe shattered me by turning me into the opposite of everything I’d known myself to be. I entered the day as a white, middle-class, highly educated philosopher focused on questions of existence, and those aspects were all reversed. For hours, I experienced the lives of women—hundreds of women—from around the world, women of color, women who were poor or had no interest in philosophy. I became all of those beings. I was completely terrified; it was, for me as a male philosopher, the perfect hell. There’s nothing wrong with being a woman or being poor or being disinterested in philosophy; the core issue was my identification with being male, with being middle class. That’s what the universe needed to break in me. The message wasn’t just to recall past lives as women—I’ve known I had those—but rather that, where I was going, gender doesn’t exist. I had to let go.</p>

<p>aling the soul—but of becoming more aware of what our lives are about and what life itself is about.
Personally: I was a brand-new professor, fresh out of graduate school, when I read Stan Grof’s work. I immediately felt I saw my life’s vocation. I had to do this work. It had been made illegal in 1970. This was 1978. I loved teaching and didn’t want to lose my job, so I developed a sideline to my career. I was an academic—teaching at the university, sitting on committees, writing papers—but in my nighttime job I began a systematic course using a psychedelic protocol I inherited from Stan Grof: totally internalized sessions, lying down, eye shades, earphones, a sitter—the drill.</p>

But it wasn’t that; it was simply following the natural deepening of the Death-Rebirth cycle: it churns at the personal level, then at the collective level. It culminated in an orgy of pain and the ocean of suffering, and then it spun me into archetypal reality. The ocean of suffering never returned after that point. There were further intense purifications, but that collective ordeal stopped, and I entered another cycle. My book Dark Night, Early Dawn explores why these collective experiences were showing up in what I thought was individual therapy.\n\nLuc Briede-Cooper:\nFor those who don’t know, COEX—Stan Grof’s term—refers to systems of condensed experience: stacks of biographical traumas down to perinatal layers, and deeper into transpersonal material, all sharing a feeling tone.",

        "text": "may date from this lifetime, from birth, or from a former lifetime, and we dissolve the COEX system.\nMy experience is that the same is true for the collective psyche—that the mind of the universe and the mind of our species store history in massive thematic clusters. All the trauma associated with war; with drought and dying on the plains; male–female violence; patterns of violence, pain, suffering, fear of death—these don’t exist as free-floating private memories within the Bardo of our individual souls. The collective psyche aggregates its history into massive collective structures I call meta-COEX systems. So you have COEX systems within the personal psyche and meta-COEX systems within the collective psyche. I think when I was moved into the ocean of suffering, my system was engaging meta-COEX systems within the collective psyche and making some small contribution to removing those clusters—not all of them, certainly not any one all the way down. This is the work of generations, and all spiritual traditions—saints, sages, contemplatives—tap into levels of suffering that are not personal. That’s why bodhichitta—the will to save all sentient beings—is the only appropriate motivation for spiritual practice. You quickly realize this is not a private game. We’re in this together. It’s a collective evolutionary process.",

I thought this would get me where I wanted to go faster—that it was about personal awakening, personal enlightenment. I thought, it’ll be harder, but I’ll burn off my karma faster. Let’s put the pedal to the metal. That turned out to be wrong on many points. The goal was not personal enlightenment. If you work with very high doses in a carefully controlled setting and start shattering boundaries, within a few years you can find, as I did, that what’s driving your sessions is not your personal development or healing but a larger historical drama of our collective development. So much of the healing in my sessions was not about healing Chris Bache or even my soul; it was engaging and healing aspects of the human family—pains stored within the collective unconscious from all the wars, unhealed traumas, abuses, droughts, men-versus-women violence, race-versus-race violence, and so on. All that unresolved trauma accumulates in the human psyche.",

That’s what Stan Grof’s work explores.\nFirst, a few words about the protocol I used, and then where this journey—told in LSD and the Mind of the Universe—went. Most of you who know Stan Grof’s work know the fundamental distinction in his methodology: low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy. Psycholytic therapy works with lower doses, perhaps 40 to 100 sessions, peeling the unconscious layer by layer, stripping down trauma, angst, pain bit by bit. At Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, they developed a different form: high-dose psychedelic therapy. The strategy was to take an overwhelming dose—about 500 micrograms—and blow through all levels of consciousness to try to trigger a near-death experience. They worked with terminally ill cancer patients, hoping to provoke a confrontation with the universe that would give a glimpse of where they were going and reduce death anxiety—and they succeeded.",

At these levels, you basically shatter your mind; it dissolves into subtler and subtler aspects of reality. It became a systematic exploration of what I think of as the mind of the universe. I hesitate to call it “the divine,” though sometimes I do, because “divine” carries so much cultural baggage.

Just out of graduate school, I encountered Stan’s Realms of the Human Unconscious and his manual LSD Psychotherapy, followed by a dozen or more important books. In those early works, Stan differentiates between low-dose psycholytic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy—very different regimens. Psycholytic heals the unconscious layer by layer; psychedelic aims for a breakthrough. At Spring Grove Hospital they worked with terminally ill patients, trying to trigger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going when they died.

They’re convenient but necessarily rough; how can six categories capture the full spectrum of divine experience? They’re useful to mark transitions on this journey. These cycles are like tori: you break through, expand into a new level, gather in, blow through to another level, stabilize competencies in that state, gather again, and then, if you follow the process, another death-rebirth into a deeper level.\n\nOne way I image this is with a nuclear explosion—not to dwell on the horror it represents, but to make a point: deep death-rebirth shatters everything you’ve known and drops you deeper into the universe, revealing levels previously outside awareness. In an explosion, deeper atmospheric layers become visible; likewise, deep psychedelic work brings levels into awareness that were always there. Dissolve the dualism in that image: you’re not separate from the strata you enter; you dissolve into that field. We’re not talking about bombs; we’re talking about the cosmos exploring itself.",

He’s integrating the experiences of thousands of people; I’m integrating my own. My experiences fit within the larger matrix his work has explored. It’s a complicated answer, because on one hand I want to say yes, and on the other I must qualify it. These substances amplify consciousness; they don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the amplified mind is different, and when an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward initially will be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history.

In Jung’s model, when we go below our conscious mind, we first encounter our personal unconscious. If you go deeper, you enter a stream of awareness shared by all human beings of your species—Jung’s collective psyche. Deeper still, you can enter broader streams—what some would call global consciousness—and then levels that go beyond space-time altogether: archetypal levels, complete states of dissolving into non-duality and what might be called causal oneness, and deeper states even than that. It’s a long journey with many levels of exploration along the way.\n\nRyan Kemp\nSo, as in Jung and in many spiritual and religious texts, we have our personal, individual mind, but the universe itself is a mind, a oneness of its own.

You relive fetal experiences, your time in the womb, birth itself, and many variations of death and rebirth. For me, moving through this level took about two years and ten sessions. In my ninth and tenth sessions, the universe just snapped me like a twig in my experience of ego death. The ego, in the end, was not very difficult to dismantle. The universe shattered me by turning me into the opposite of everything I’d known myself to be. I entered the day as a white, middle-class, highly educated philosopher focused on questions of existence, and those aspects were all reversed. For hours, I experienced the lives of women—hundreds of women—from around the world, women of color, women who were poor or had no interest in philosophy. I became all of those beings. I was completely terrified; it was, for me as a male philosopher, the perfect hell. There’s nothing wrong with being a woman or being poor or being disinterested in philosophy; the core issue was my identification with being male, with being middle class. That’s what the universe needed to break in me. The message wasn’t just to recall past lives as women—I’ve known I had those—but rather that, where I was going, gender doesn’t exist.

        "text": "To explain these patterns in his data, Grof introduced the concepts of COEX system and Basic Perinatal Matrix (BPM). A COEX system, short for “system of condensed experience,” is a specific constellation of memories (and fantasies) from many periods of an individual's life that share a common theme and are marked by a common emotional charge. For a simple analogy, imagine taking a novel and highlighting the protagonist’s many experiences in different colors according to their emotional content—red for anger, green for jealousy, yellow for fear, etc. If you were then to cut up the entire book and gather all the cuttings of each color into separate piles, each pile would represent a single COEX system. The surface layers of a COEX system are made up of more recent or superficial experiences of that particular emotion. As you move deeper into the system, the experiences tend to become older and more basic. At the center of each system is a core experience or set of experiences that represents the primary disturbance, the seed experience around which later experiences cluster.",

Grof has demonstrated that our personal unconscious organizes its memories into *clusters of experience* that come from different periods of our life but share a common emotional theme. As we saw in chapter 2, he calls these clusters of condensed experience COEX systems. The psychedelic experiences presented in this chapter suggest that the collective unconscious organizes its vast store of memories in a similar fashion. It appears to gather the memories of humanity into *giant memory clusters* that come from different people and different historical periods but share a common emotional theme. I call these collective memory clusters META-COEX systems.

It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.",

It is both the basement of the personal unconscious and the doorway to spiritual states of awareness. Entering this domain triggers an extremely realistic confrontation with death that is often combined with reliving one’s birth and a variety of intense physical and emotional discharges. This existential confrontation with death and the limits of physical existence drives a fundamental question: Do our lives have any true meaning and purpose in the larger scheme of things, or are we just the random products of a blind and indifferent universe? Through systematically engaging these physical, psychological, and existential trials, one works through a series of core issues that eventually culminate in the complete collapse of one’s physical identity, followed by rebirth into spiritual reality.",

Drawing largely from Hindu and Buddhist sources, Wilber saw these four stages as evolutionary stepping-stones culminating in nondual spiritual realization. While referencing Wilber’s model, Grof does not use these terms to classify stages of spiritual development but rather to distinguish different states of consciousness that emerge in psychedelic and Holotropic Breathwork sessions. That is, his description is phenomenological rather than hierarchical. In this context, he distinguishes low and high psychic, subtle, and causal consciousness, giving examples of each drawn from his extensive archives.",

Against the background of this collective database, however, tracking one person through this terrain brings out certain features of the psychedelic process more sharply: the multiple stages of initiation, the deepening spiral of death and rebirth, and the participatory dynamics of psychedelic disclosure.

Many insights came concerning the broad sweep of creation, how consciousness consolidates itself into matter deliberately and by stages.",

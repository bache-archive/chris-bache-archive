What was the metric?\n\nChris Bache:\nThe metric was 500 to 600 micrograms, which is a very high dose. Stan Grof differentiates between low-dose therapy (about 200 micrograms up to 300), psychedelic therapy (high dose, between 300 to 500 micrograms), but in the early work at Spring Grove Hospital, the dose was deliberately limited to a maximum of three sessions, with the idea of triggering an experience of transcendence to help people come to terms with impending death. I thought that if you could do this safely three times, you could do it more frequently. So, I saw myself as just doing an extended course of high-dose therapy.",

At Spring Grove Hospital, they developed a protocol for psychedelic therapy aiming to trigger a near-death experience in terminally ill patients, and it was limited to three sessions. I thought, if you could go into high-dose space three times safely, you could do it more times safely.\n\nIn the beginning I did high-dose work partly because it was hard to find time in a dual-career marriage—and soon there were children. To get a day we could give to this work, I still thought in terms of a personal therapeutic model. The Eastern sources I taught as a professor of religious studies said your karma is ultimately finite, even over many lifetimes. I thought I could work through mine faster by working with high doses. I knew the sessions would be hard, but if I stayed grounded and confronted the shadow, I thought I could move faster.

I still thought in a personal-therapy model: higher doses would turn up more of my psyche, I’d clean up my stuff faster, and get to enlightenment faster. Turns out my assumptions were wrong. At high doses you activate a larger piece of the fabric of existence. What may begin as an individual transformational process becomes part of humanity’s larger collective process.\n\nThree or four years in, when I began to understand some of this, I also discovered I had a constitution wired for high-dose work. I could get very large and spacious—and, importantly, I could contract safely at the end. Not everyone should work with psychedelics at all, and many should not work with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. Even if you have aptitude and strong support, I would be much gentler. I’d take a gentler way in, work more with lower doses, balance occasional high doses with integrating lower doses. I’d also balance LSD with psilocybin or ayahuasca—the vegetative psychedelics.

In the early years, the high-dose work done at Spring Grove Hospital with terminally ill patients was limited to three sessions. Low-dose psychedelic work was open-ended; high-dose work was capped at three. Going in, I thought if you could do it safely three times, you could do it safely more times. But by doing it as systematically as I did and pushing the edge as hard as I did, issues and challenges arose that hadn’t been discussed in the early literature. Opportunities for insight and understanding emerged, but so did challenges in navigating increasingly intense, vast levels of consciousness—what it does to your body and mind as you enter these realities, and how it affects people around you.",

I thought it was about personal transformation—my healing, my spiritual awakening—and that by working with high doses I’d be biting off my karma in larger pieces and clearing it faster. That turned out to be profoundly incomplete. Personal transformation was too small to describe it. Also, I wanted to be efficient. I was in a dual-career marriage; getting time for sessions was complicated, and I wanted to get as much done in every session as I could.\n\nWhat I learned along the way is that because consciousness is unified at its source, when you hyper-stimulate consciousness you're not just hyper-stimulating your personal field—you’re engaging some portion of the unified field.

        "text": "High-dose *psychedelic therapy* (300-500 mcg) is a very different form of psychedelic engagement. In this therapeutic modality, consciousness is much more powerfully amplified, and the strategy is to push through the psychodynamic level of consciousness and trigger an experience of ego-death and transcendence. Rather than working through one’s personal issues layer by layer, psychedelic therapy seeks to evoke an ecstatic state in which the boundaries between the self and the universe are dissolved, allowing one to reconnect with spiritual reality and gain a new perspective on one’s life. Verbal interaction during a session is kept to a minimum. This therapeutic protocol is sometimes described as the “single overwhelming dose” approach. At Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, where Grof and his colleagues worked with terminally ill patients, high-dose psychedelic therapy was limited to three sessions.",

Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web.

Later, after this model had imploded for reasons I will give in chapter 6, I continued working with high doses because I had developed a taste for it.

I thought that if I could just undergo a “complete ego-death” they would clear up. Eventually, however, I realized that they were being caused not from dying too little but from dying too much. With each round of death and rebirth, I was being plunged deeper into the furnace of creation. Though I could accommodate this energy well enough in the short term, my body was having increasing difficulty managing it in the long term. My system was simply running too hot. Eventually, I realized that I had to stop plunging myself into the fire of Pure Radiance, no matter how much! longed to be there. I had to let my system cool down. I had to let my physical being integrate more completely what it had already received. William Blake wrote, “You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.” My body was telling me that seventy-three high-dose sessions was more than enough.",

        "text": "I think it’s better to bundle these early experiences of the ocean of suffering together rather than take you through them session by entire session. Concentrating them into a few pages, however, may make them appear worse than they actually were, if that’s possible. In actual practice, the ocean of suffering was broken up into installments lasting a few hours each and separated by months in which I had time to digest them and prepare myself for the next round. Once I learned what was waiting for me inside the sessions, the mornings of a session day were tense. Like a woman going into labor or a soldier going into battle, my attention turned deeply within as I prepared for what was about to happen. Carol called it “going into the tunnel.” It would start hours, sometimes days before a session.",

> Christopher M. Bache is a prominent figure in the field of psychedelic therapy, known for his extensive work with high doses of LSD over two decades. His research explores the distinctions between low-dose and high-dose psychedelic experiences, emphasizing the profound effects of higher doses on consciousness and therapeutic outcomes. Bache's insights contribute to the ongoing discourse on the therapeutic potential of psychedelics and the complexities involved in their use.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU ch.1 §4 ¶1**

> After getting my bearings in several low-dose sessions (200 micro-grams [mcg]), I chose a regimen of working with high doses of LSD. For those unfamiliar with the difference between low-dose and highdose LSD therapy, let me briefly summarize Grof’s description of these two therapeutic modalities and then describe the protocol I adopted.

**LSDMU ch.1 §4 ¶5**

> High-dose *psychedelic therapy* (300-500 mcg) is a very different form of psychedelic engagement. In this therapeutic modality, consciousness is much more powerfully amplified, and the strategy is to push through the psychodynamic level of consciousness and trigger an experience of ego-death and transcendence. Rather than working through one’s personal issues layer by layer, psychedelic therapy seeks to evoke an ecstatic state in which the boundaries between the self and the universe are dissolved, allowing one to reconnect with spiritual reality and gain a new perspective on one’s life. Verbal interaction during a session is kept to a minimum. This therapeutic protocol is sometimes described as the “single overwhelming dose” approach. At Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, where Grof and his colleagues worked with terminally ill patients, high-dose psychedelic therapy was limited to three sessions.

**LSDMU ch.1 §5 ¶2**

> The choice to work with high doses turned out to have enormous consequences for what unfolded on this journey. It radically expanded not only the *depth of consciousness* reached but also the *breadth of consciousness* being activated in each session. It wasn’t simply a matter of eating the same karmic meal in fewer bites, as I had naively thought. Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web. Working at these levels changed not only how deep my experiences went but also who or what was actually having these experiences, what the “working unit” of experience was in a session. In these highly energized conditions, the size of the patient literally expands. What I mean by this will become clearer as we proceed.

**LSDMU ch.1 §5 ¶1**

> I initially chose to work with high doses of LSD because it was difficult to find days for inner journeying in a dual-career marriage and I simply wanted to make the most of each session. I knew that the sessions would be more challenging, but the spiritual literature I had read described one’s karmic conditioning as being ultimately finite, and I thought that I could work through mine faster by using this intense method of transformation, in effect biting off larger pieces of karma in each session. I thought that if I confronted my shadow conscientiously and could endure the intensity of the work, it would get me to my goal of personal liberation faster. Later, after this model had imploded for reasons I will give in chapter 6, I continued working with high doses because I had developed a taste for it. It took me where I wanted to go and then further than I imagined possible.

**LSDMU ch.2 §1 ¶12**

> The 4th session was my first high-dose session, and the pace stepped up accordingly. It began with some strong perinatal elements, which I will return to in a minute, but what stands out for me is the experience of being judged and found worthy followed by a process of deep attunement. This pattern of crisis followed by resolution and realignment would repeat itself in many subsequent sessions.

**LSDMU ch.8 §1 ¶45**

> I have asked myself this question many times over the years, responding differently at different stages of my journey, sometimes cursing the day I started this work but more often on my knees in gratitude. It is a pressing question, especially if one works with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD, for this protocol unleashes more extreme experiences than when lower doses or milder psychedelics are used. For the time being, let me say just this.

**LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶6**

> Given the emphasis being placed today on the therapeutic applications of psychedelics, it may be surprising to learn that my early sessions did not involve much personal healing. There was some but not much. If I had been working with lower doses, there would probably have been more, but when you work with doses of LSD this high, you tend to drop quickly beneath the personal unconscious into what Stanislav Grof calls the perinatal level of consciousness. Instead of engaging the individual wounds we have collected in life, one goes deeper to confront a universal wound shared by all human beings—the certain destruction of everyone and everything we love and care about, including ourselves.

**LSDMU ch.1 §8 ¶2**

> Working at these high-dose levels, I found that insights into my personal life tended to surface at the beginning and end of a session, when I was leaving and returning to my life in the physical world. During the middle hours when the session was at its peak, I was usually operating beyond the range of personal reality, at least after the first fifteen sessions or so. This doesn’t mean that the personal element was completely absent, for sometimes I was shown the personal relevance of this or that teaching and sometimes an entire session was spent in personal healing or instruction. But in general, there was a marked difference between the content of the peak hours of a session and the content of its beginning and ending hours. The following image may help convey this point.

**LSDMU ch.10 §0 ¶16**

> After subtracting the half dozen or so sessions that were spent digesting the Diamond Luminosity and Great Awakening sessions, the strongest pattern in the remaining sessions was a series of personal healings. Pains from my childhood were systematically brought forward and resolved in a decisive and efficient manner. At first I thought this was odd, coming after years of working at the collective level to heal the species-mind. I thought that personal healing would normally have taken place before collective healing, and it took me awhile to understand why things were unfolding in this reverse order. I did not get the sense that it was because I had simply jumped over these personal issues because of the high doses I was working with, though the work would surely have unfolded differently had I been working with lower doses. There was something different going on.

**LSDMU ch.11 §0 ¶3**

> I was never in control of what happened in my sessions. I found early on that I could set all the intentions I wanted, but when one is working with doses of LSD this high, it makes little difference. From the very beginning, a larger intelligence had been in control of my sessions. I learned that the best thing I could do was simply get out of the way and let it take me where it wanted me to go. And so it was for my last sessions. The same intelligence that had guided me all these years choreographed the ending of our time together before I even knew we were parting.

**LSDMU ch.11 §2 ¶1**

> Why I Stopped My Sessions I had not seen the end of my sessions coming, but as soon as this session was over, I knew it was time for me to stop. This was not a calculated decision; I just knew that I had come to a stopping point. Though I would do light journey work of one form or another in the years ahead, my time for working with high doses of LSD was over. There were two reasons behind this decision. One was pain; the other was heartache.

**LSDMU ch.2 §2 ¶1**

> As soon as I shifted to working with higher doses in the 4th session, the sessions dropped me into the hard side of the perinatal encounter. Many readers will know what this means from having read Stan Grof’s books. For those who don’t, I will summarize his concept of the perinatal level of consciousness at the end of this chapter. The perinatal domain is a complex territory that Stan has mapped with great therapeutic insight, demonstrating the influence that unresolved birth trauma can have on our subsequent psychological development. Rather than give a complete account of these dynamics here, let me say just this.

**LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶13**

> And yet, as I write this last sentence, something in me pulls back. This may have been my truth, but as I begin to share the story of my journey, I find that I can’t wish anyone to undergo some of the trials I went through on it. If there were no other way to reach paradise, that would be one thing, but there are other ways, slower ways, and therefore I counsel a gentler entrance into the Great Expanse. I recognize better now that the protocol I adopted represents an extreme form of the sacred medicine path. The story that follows, therefore, is *not* representative of what happens on this pathin gentler hands. We do not need to undergo such extreme ordeals to come to our spiritual senses.

**LSDMU ch.2 §2 ¶10**

> Although I was mentally prepared for these experiences, I was surprised by how violent they were. Perhaps they were made more so by the high doses I was working with; I don’t know. In the first hours of every session, I experienced fierce electrical spasms exploding in my body, sometimes accompanied by hyperventilation and nasal discharge. Convulsions would shoot through me, bouncing me across the mattress. It felt like someone was jamminga cattle prod in my stomach. Sometimes they had a wrenching quality, like having the dry heaves for hours at a time. I became very familiar with vomiting.

**LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶108**

> I could make a difference in the experience of this species. Would I choose to make a difference?

**LSDMU ch.12 §1 ¶14**

> I think it’s safe to say that the trials I’m describing don’t show up in therapeutic protocols where the psychedelic is gentler, like psilocybin, or the sessions fewer. There is a self-limiting quality when we use these medicines in ways that leave the frame of our earthly life more intact. It is when the stronger psychedelics are used with greater daring that this particular challenge emerges. The joy of plunging deep into the Divine is also the pain of plunging deep, a pain born not of failure but of success.

**LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶69**

> be this much of a jump in suffering, but this session was many times more terrible than anything before.

**LSDMU ch.3 §0 ¶17**

> Why does he do it? she asked herself. Why can’t he be satisfied with the slower methods? He’s too impatient, that’s why! she answered. Does he really know what these sessions are doing to him? Are they really as safe as he insists? How could it be safe to experience this much pain in one day? Sometimes when he tries to tell me what he’s been through, he stops midsentence, unable to say more.

**LSDMU ch.11 §2 ¶4**

> In earlier years, I had thought that these energy problems were a sign that my ego-death was incomplete. I thought that if I could just undergo a “complete ego-death” they would clear up. Eventually, however, I realized that they were being caused not from dying too little but from dying too much. With each round of death and rebirth, I was being plunged deeper into the furnace of creation. Though I could accommodate this energy well enough in the short term, my body was having increasing difficulty managing it in the long term. My system was simply running too hot. Eventually, I realized that I had to stop plunging myself into the fire of Pure Radiance, no matter how much! longed to be there. I had to let my system cool down. I had to let my physical being integrate more completely what it had already received. William Blake wrote, “You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.” My body was telling me that seventy-three high-dose sessions was more than enough.

**LSDMU ch.4 §0 ¶7**

> I think it’s better to bundle these early experiences of the ocean of suffering together rather than take you through them session by entire session. Concentrating them into a few pages, however, may make them appear worse than they actually were, if that’s possible. In actual practice, the ocean of suffering was broken up into installments lasting a few hours each and separated by months in which I had time to digest them and prepare myself for the next round. Once I learned what was waiting for me inside the sessions, the mornings of a session day were tense. Like a woman going into labor or a soldier going into battle, my attention turned deeply within as I prepared for what was about to happen. Carol called it “going into the tunnel.” It would start hours, sometimes days before a session.

> ople asked about those levels. And, as you said, you would go lower if you were to do it over again.
Chris Bache:
After the first three sessions, which were medium-dose, I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms—right at the body’s maximum capacity to absorb. Taking more doesn’t necessarily take you deeper. I was working at very high levels that can shatter the structures of consciousness and take you temporarily beyond your traditional ways of knowing yourself and the world. Again, I would be much gentler in the early days.

James Jesso:
Just to clarify for listeners—what would you consider a "high dose" of LSD? What was the metric?

Chris Bache:
The metric was 500 to 600 micrograms, which is a very high dose. Stan Grof differentiates between low-dose therapy (about 200 micrograms up to 300), psychedelic therapy (high dose, between 300 to 500 micrograms), but in the early work at Spring Grove Hospital, the dose was deliberately limited to a maximum of three sessions, with the idea of triggering an experience of transcendence to help people come to terms with impending death. I thought that if you could do this safely three times, you could do it more frequently. So, I saw myself as just doing an extended course of high-dose therapy.

Lauren Taus: You took 73 high-dose LSD trips over the course of 20 years—and really high dose?
Chris Bache: Yeah. And I wouldn't recommend that. I wouldn't do it the same way again myself, and I strongly recommend that people don't do it that way. I would be much gentler with myself and have a more modulated approach. But that's what I did. I started with three sessions at medium doses—about 250 micrograms—and then for the remainder I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms.

Lauren Taus: What inspired you to double the dose and continue in the way that you did?

> all its levels, triggering a near-death-type experience and hopefully reducing anxiety around dying.
After a few low dose sessions, I opted for a very intense regimen with LSD. Over twenty years, I completed 73 high-dose, fully internalized, therapeutically focused psychedelic sessions, always following the same protocol, with my first wife Carol—herself a clinical psychologist—as my sitter in every session. I worked for four years, stopped for six, then worked another ten aggressive years.

I don’t recommend this protocol to others, especially such high doses. No current federal research recommends doses this high. But I wanted to push the limits, thinking that if high-dose psychedelic work could be done safely three times in the Spring Grove project, perhaps it could be done more often. I found it could, but it’s extremely demanding and brings both opportunities and challenges earlier protocols didn’t envision.

> ing at the edge of my ability, consolidating what I experienced as an important part of the process.
Looping back to why I wouldn’t do it the same way again: over the long haul, working at doses this high—responsibly and conscientiously, supplemented by other spiritual practice, yoga, meditation—is very demanding. It’s taxing. If I were doing it over, I’d be gentler with myself: balance high-dose sessions with low-dose; balance LSD, which tends to be a high-level, cosmic psychedelic, with psilocybin or ayahuasca—more body-grounded medicines—to facilitate ongoing integration of peak experiences. Hammering the high levels did open great cosmic vistas, but I was harder on myself than needed, maybe harder than was wise. It took a long time to internalize and, in some ways, recuperate from the journey.

> tocol, the key question is: What made you decide to do such large doses, given that in his protocol—
Chris Bache:
In Stan’s early work, he differentiates between psycholytic or low-dose therapy and psychedelic high-dose therapy. At Spring Grove Hospital, they developed a protocol for psychedelic therapy aiming to trigger a near-death experience in terminally ill patients, and it was limited to three sessions. I thought, if you could go into high-dose space three times safely, you could do it more times safely.

In the beginning I did high-dose work partly because it was hard to find time in a dual-career marriage—and soon there were children. To get a day we could give to this work, I still thought in terms of a personal therapeutic model. The Eastern sources I taught as a professor of religious studies said your karma is ultimately finite, even over many lifetimes. I thought I could work through mine faster by working with high doses. I knew the sessions would be hard, but if I stayed grounded and confronted the shadow, I thought I could move faster. Eventually that model shattered when I realized the sessions went far beyond my personal psyche and karma.

> d. I went underground as part of the transitional underground generation and started high-dose work.
At first, it was a matter of efficiency. I still thought in a personal-therapy model: higher doses would turn up more of my psyche, I’d clean up my stuff faster, and get to enlightenment faster. Turns out my assumptions were wrong. At high doses you activate a larger piece of the fabric of existence. What may begin as an individual transformational process becomes part of humanity’s larger collective process.

Three or four years in, when I began to understand some of this, I also discovered I had a constitution wired for high-dose work. I could get very large and spacious—and, importantly, I could contract safely at the end. Not everyone should work with psychedelics at all, and many should not work with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. Even if you have aptitude and strong support, I would be much gentler. I’d take a gentler way in, work more with lower doses, balance occasional high doses with integrating lower doses. I’d also balance LSD with psilocybin or ayahuasca—the vegetative psychedelics. There’s a lot I would do differently.

> gal reasons and partly because it took a long time to map and understand the dynamics that unfolded.
I want to say at the outset this is not a methodology I would recommend today. If I were doing it over, I’d be gentler on myself. I’d take a slower process, balancing high-dose work with low-dose sessions. I’d also balance LSD with psilocybin and ayahuasca—more body-grounded psychedelics—for a variety of reasons I discuss in the book.

> er a session. It’s one very intense day, with several days of preparation and integration around it.
After several medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at very high levels using psychedelic therapy—not low-dose psycholytic therapy. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. It’s not that I’m against occasional high doses of LSD, but consistently exploding consciousness so aggressively is not something I encourage now. I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms for 73 sessions over 20 years—on average about five sessions a year. I worked for four years, took a six-year hiatus, then worked in a very aggressive 10 years. It averaged about five sessions a year.

Tasshin Fogleman:
Can you explain the difference between psychedelic and psycholytic protocols?

> e medicines. LSD strikes me as cleaner in that respect; it doesn’t have the same programmed quality.
I don’t know what it would have been like working with low-dose LSD. I’m sure that would have been more personal and psychodynamically oriented. But at the very high doses I worked with, after the first 15 sessions or so, during the peak hours I wasn’t working in relation to my personal psyche at all. In the book, I downplay the personal story because it mostly showed up at the beginning and end of sessions—meaningful and healing for my life, but the peaks were far beyond the personal psyche.

Chris Bache

Joe Moore
He is a very strong proponent of these high-level doses. I struggle with his arguments around it, but yours seem quite sensible. It’s—how do we approach it?

Kyle Buller:
I'm not a proponent of high doses myself. I did this work and came through it. In the early years, the high-dose work done at Spring Grove Hospital with terminally ill patients was limited to three sessions. Low-dose psychedelic work was open-ended; high-dose work was capped at three. Going in, I thought if you could do it safely three times, you could do it safely more times. But by doing it as systematically as I did and pushing the edge as hard as I did, issues and challenges arose that hadn’t been discussed in the early literature. Opportunities for insight and understanding emerged, but so did challenges in navigating increasingly intense, vast levels of consciousness—what it does to your body and mind as you enter these realities, and how it affects people around you.

> th psilocybin and ayahuasca. I still would have taken the journey, but not as aggressively as I did.
Sandy Sedgbeer: You experienced 73 higher-dose LSD sessions following protocols established by Stanislav Grof, with the intention of engaging hyper-intensive states in a way that would allow the initial chaos at each new level to clear and also allow your biophysical and psychological systems to adapt. How did you know the precise dosage to accomplish that in the way you wanted to?

Chris Bache: Stan was very clear in his early books, and in LSD Psychotherapy published in 1980, about the differences between psycholytic (low-dose) therapy and psychedelic (high-dose) therapy. Psycholytic work typically runs in the 50–150 microgram range, while high-dose psychedelic therapy is in the several-hundred-microgram range. At that time, high-dose therapy was being used at Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore with terminal patients to trigger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going.

> ger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going.
I thought, if you can do this work three times safely, you can do it more than three times safely. I chose high doses for a couple of reasons. One, I had a false model of what the project was. I thought it was about personal transformation—my healing, my spiritual awakening—and that by working with high doses I’d be biting off my karma in larger pieces and clearing it faster. That turned out to be profoundly incomplete. Personal transformation was too small to describe it. Also, I wanted to be efficient. I was in a dual-career marriage; getting time for sessions was complicated, and I wanted to get as much done in every session as I could.

What I learned along the way is that because consciousness is unified at its source, when you hyper-stimulate consciousness you're not just hyper-stimulating your personal field—you’re engaging some portion of the unified field. The dynamics that get activated—healing, purification, illumination—are much larger than personal dynamics.

> ssing some of the healing work or lower-dose work? How might you use different dose ranges as tools?
Chris Bache
Any work with psychedelics—especially higher doses in a therapeutic protocol—can be challenging, and calls for good psychological screening to make sure your psyche is ready for these depths. Some people should never go near psychedelics. Some should work only very gently, if at all. I happen to have a constitution that can flow into expansive states readily and recongeal smoothly at the end. Not everybody is wired like that. All the clinical cautions apply.

Can you bypass? You can chase a level of experience and bypass others, but that didn’t happen to me. I spent the first 10 sessions—two and a half years—in very grueling work at what Stan calls the perinatal level, the interface between the personal unconscious and the collective or transpersonal. You’re reliving your birth, dealing with existential crises—really grinding things deeply at that level.

> y things are unfolding a certain way, but it always comes out well in the end. That was my approach.
As for not recommending this work: I wouldn't work at such high doses so frequently. Not that high doses shouldn't ever be used, but I wouldn't recommend "blowing consciousness apart" so aggressively for so many sessions over so many years. Even though I was responsible—about five sessions a year, lots of time to recuperate, taking care of my body, doing spiritual practice, keeping detailed notes within 24 hours, studying those notes as methodically as possible—it was still intense. By the end of my journey, I had major breakthroughs and insights, but I realized an assumption I had held was wrong: that there is a particular goal or endpoint, whether it's oneness with God, the meta-cosmic void, or the super-cosmic void.

> a more gentle fashion. We can do a great deal of very good work without taking psychedelics at all.
In fact, many people who have written me have never taken psychedelics—or took them once or twice early in life—but have been meditators for 40 or 50 years. They compare the cosmology that emerges in my story to the cosmology that has emerged for them in meditation and find strong parallels. At the deepest level, the issue is not psychedelics; the issue is consciousness—its boundaries and functions. Some people should stay away from these powerful amplifiers.

Emmy Vadnais:
How many micrograms—what was the dose you were usually working at? After we did that interview, some people asked about those levels. And, as you said, you would go lower if you were to do it over again.

> to understand our universe as deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness as deeply as I could.
A few observations on method. Many are aware of the distinction between low-dose psychedelic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy that Stan developed. Low-dose therapy peels the mind gradually, layer by layer, in very intense therapeutic encounters. High-dose therapy is a different protocol. In the early days, it was used to try to trigger a near-death experience for people with terminal cancer—not to heal them, but to open them to the world they were about to enter.

> terminally ill patients facing death. At Spring Grove Hospital, they limited this to three sessions.
I came along and thought, if it can be done safely three times, it can be done safely more than three times. It can, but it’s much more demanding than I anticipated, and it took all my resources to manage what unfolded. This is not a therapeutic journey; it’s cosmological exploration. It requires an explorer’s constitution and preparation, and a position in life that allows pushing this far beyond the maps most people use. When I finished and looked back, I realized I had to give it a different name. I call it psychedelic exploration. The method uses the protocol of psychedelic therapy—total isolation, always a sitter, carefully selected music, and so on—but the difference is the number of sessions. I did 73. Three sessions at the psychodynamic level—about 200 micrograms—and after that, all at 500–600 micrograms. This is not a protocol I recommend. I wouldn’t do it this way again. I would balance plant medicines with synthetics and only push periodically with high doses rather than so relentlessly. I have worked with psilocybin, ayahuasca, and salvia divinorum—mostly after I stopped the LSD work—but LSD and the Mind of the Universe focuses on what happened in the high-dose journey.

> could do it more frequently. So, I saw myself as just doing an extended course of high-dose therapy.
But when I got to the end of this journey and looked back, I realized what unfolded was more radical and challenging than what had emerged in early psychedelic therapy work, so I had to coin a new phrase: psychedelic exploration. The method was psychedelic therapy—totally internalized sessions, strong evocative music, working with a sitter, always in a protected, isolated environment, classic set and setting. The difference was the number of sessions: for me, it turned out to be 73.

Lauren Taus: What inspired you to double the dose and continue in the way that you did?
Chris Bache: First, I saw Stan’s early work and the distinction between psycholytic therapy and psychedelic therapy, so I knew that working with high doses could be safe and managed effectively. I knew the sessions would be more difficult at that intensity, but I thought if I focused on confronting my shadow, I could work with those doses as long as I could manage the intensity. In the beginning, arranging a session day in a dual-career marriage with children was hard to do, so I wanted to make the most out of every day. After working at those levels for a while, I developed an aptitude for them. I liked where they were taking me, and I continued to press on.

Lauren Taus: For the sake of listeners who might not have as much knowledge as we do, can you name the difference between psycholytic therapy and psychedelic therapy?

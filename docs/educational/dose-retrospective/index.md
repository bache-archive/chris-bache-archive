> Christopher M. Bache is a prominent figure in the field of psychedelic therapy, known for his extensive research and personal experiences with high-dose LSD sessions. His work explores the distinctions between low-dose and high-dose psychedelic therapies, emphasizing the profound psychological and spiritual transformations that can occur at elevated doses. Bache's insights contribute to the ongoing discourse on the therapeutic potential of psychedelics and the complexities involved in their use.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶1**

> After getting my bearings in several low-dose sessions (200 micro-grams [mcg]), I chose a regimen of working with high doses of LSD. For those unfamiliar with the difference between low-dose and highdose LSD therapy, let me briefly summarize Grof’s description of these two therapeutic modalities and then describe the protocol I adopted.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶5**

> High-dose *psychedelic therapy* (300-500 mcg) is a very different form of psychedelic engagement. In this therapeutic modality, consciousness is much more powerfully amplified, and the strategy is to push through the psychodynamic level of consciousness and trigger an experience of ego-death and transcendence. Rather than working through one’s personal issues layer by layer, psychedelic therapy seeks to evoke an ecstatic state in which the boundaries between the self and the universe are dissolved, allowing one to reconnect with spiritual reality and gain a new perspective on one’s life. Verbal interaction during a session is kept to a minimum. This therapeutic protocol is sometimes described as the “single overwhelming dose” approach. At Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore, where Grof and his colleagues worked with terminally ill patients, high-dose psychedelic therapy was limited to three sessions.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶2**

> The choice to work with high doses turned out to have enormous consequences for what unfolded on this journey. It radically expanded not only the *depth of consciousness* reached but also the *breadth of consciousness* being activated in each session. It wasn’t simply a matter of eating the same karmic meal in fewer bites, as I had naively thought. Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web. Working at these levels changed not only how deep my experiences went but also who or what was actually having these experiences, what the “working unit” of experience was in a session. In these highly energized conditions, the size of the patient literally expands. What I mean by this will become clearer as we proceed.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶1**

> I initially chose to work with high doses of LSD because it was difficult to find days for inner journeying in a dual-career marriage and I simply wanted to make the most of each session. I knew that the sessions would be more challenging, but the spiritual literature I had read described one’s karmic conditioning as being ultimately finite, and I thought that I could work through mine faster by using this intense method of transformation, in effect biting off larger pieces of karma in each session. I thought that if I confronted my shadow conscientiously and could endure the intensity of the work, it would get me to my goal of personal liberation faster. Later, after this model had imploded for reasons I will give in chapter 6, I continued working with high doses because I had developed a taste for it. It took me where I wanted to go and then further than I imagined possible.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §1 ¶12**

> The 4th session was my first high-dose session, and the pace stepped up accordingly. It began with some strong perinatal elements, which I will return to in a minute, but what stands out for me is the experience of being judged and found worthy followed by a process of deep attunement. This pattern of crisis followed by resolution and realignment would repeat itself in many subsequent sessions.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶45**

> I have asked myself this question many times over the years, responding differently at different stages of my journey, sometimes cursing the day I started this work but more often on my knees in gratitude. It is a pressing question, especially if one works with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD, for this protocol unleashes more extreme experiences than when lower doses or milder psychedelics are used. For the time being, let me say just this.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶6**

> Given the emphasis being placed today on the therapeutic applications of psychedelics, it may be surprising to learn that my early sessions did not involve much personal healing. There was some but not much. If I had been working with lower doses, there would probably have been more, but when you work with doses of LSD this high, you tend to drop quickly beneath the personal unconscious into what Stanislav Grof calls the perinatal level of consciousness. Instead of engaging the individual wounds we have collected in life, one goes deeper to confront a universal wound shared by all human beings—the certain destruction of everyone and everything we love and care about, including ourselves.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶2**

> Working at these high-dose levels, I found that insights into my personal life tended to surface at the beginning and end of a session, when I was leaving and returning to my life in the physical world. During the middle hours when the session was at its peak, I was usually operating beyond the range of personal reality, at least after the first fifteen sessions or so. This doesn’t mean that the personal element was completely absent, for sometimes I was shown the personal relevance of this or that teaching and sometimes an entire session was spent in personal healing or instruction. But in general, there was a marked difference between the content of the peak hours of a session and the content of its beginning and ending hours. The following image may help convey this point.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶16**

> After subtracting the half dozen or so sessions that were spent digesting the Diamond Luminosity and Great Awakening sessions, the strongest pattern in the remaining sessions was a series of personal healings. Pains from my childhood were systematically brought forward and resolved in a decisive and efficient manner. At first I thought this was odd, coming after years of working at the collective level to heal the species-mind. I thought that personal healing would normally have taken place before collective healing, and it took me awhile to understand why things were unfolding in this reverse order. I did not get the sense that it was because I had simply jumped over these personal issues because of the high doses I was working with, though the work would surely have unfolded differently had I been working with lower doses. There was something different going on.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §0 ¶3**

> I was never in control of what happened in my sessions. I found early on that I could set all the intentions I wanted, but when one is working with doses of LSD this high, it makes little difference. From the very beginning, a larger intelligence had been in control of my sessions. I learned that the best thing I could do was simply get out of the way and let it take me where it wanted me to go. And so it was for my last sessions. The same intelligence that had guided me all these years choreographed the ending of our time together before I even knew we were parting.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §2 ¶1**

> Why I Stopped My Sessions I had not seen the end of my sessions coming, but as soon as this session was over, I knew it was time for me to stop. This was not a calculated decision; I just knew that I had come to a stopping point. Though I would do light journey work of one form or another in the years ahead, my time for working with high doses of LSD was over. There were two reasons behind this decision. One was pain; the other was heartache.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶1**

> As soon as I shifted to working with higher doses in the 4th session, the sessions dropped me into the hard side of the perinatal encounter. Many readers will know what this means from having read Stan Grof’s books. For those who don’t, I will summarize his concept of the perinatal level of consciousness at the end of this chapter. The perinatal domain is a complex territory that Stan has mapped with great therapeutic insight, demonstrating the influence that unresolved birth trauma can have on our subsequent psychological development. Rather than give a complete account of these dynamics here, let me say just this.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶13**

> And yet, as I write this last sentence, something in me pulls back. This may have been my truth, but as I begin to share the story of my journey, I find that I can’t wish anyone to undergo some of the trials I went through on it. If there were no other way to reach paradise, that would be one thing, but there are other ways, slower ways, and therefore I counsel a gentler entrance into the Great Expanse. I recognize better now that the protocol I adopted represents an extreme form of the sacred medicine path. The story that follows, therefore, is *not* representative of what happens on this pathin gentler hands. We do not need to undergo such extreme ordeals to come to our spiritual senses.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶10**

> Although I was mentally prepared for these experiences, I was surprised by how violent they were. Perhaps they were made more so by the high doses I was working with; I don’t know. In the first hours of every session, I experienced fierce electrical spasms exploding in my body, sometimes accompanied by hyperventilation and nasal discharge. Convulsions would shoot through me, bouncing me across the mattress. It felt like someone was jamminga cattle prod in my stomach. Sometimes they had a wrenching quality, like having the dry heaves for hours at a time. I became very familiar with vomiting.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶108**

> I could make a difference in the experience of this species. Would I choose to make a difference?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §1 ¶14**

> I think it’s safe to say that the trials I’m describing don’t show up in therapeutic protocols where the psychedelic is gentler, like psilocybin, or the sessions fewer. There is a self-limiting quality when we use these medicines in ways that leave the frame of our earthly life more intact. It is when the stronger psychedelics are used with greater daring that this particular challenge emerges. The joy of plunging deep into the Divine is also the pain of plunging deep, a pain born not of failure but of success.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶69**

> be this much of a jump in suffering, but this session was many times more terrible than anything before.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.3 §0 ¶17**

> Why does he do it? she asked herself. Why can’t he be satisfied with the slower methods? He’s too impatient, that’s why! she answered. Does he really know what these sessions are doing to him? Are they really as safe as he insists? How could it be safe to experience this much pain in one day? Sometimes when he tries to tell me what he’s been through, he stops midsentence, unable to say more.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §2 ¶4**

> In earlier years, I had thought that these energy problems were a sign that my ego-death was incomplete. I thought that if I could just undergo a “complete ego-death” they would clear up. Eventually, however, I realized that they were being caused not from dying too little but from dying too much. With each round of death and rebirth, I was being plunged deeper into the furnace of creation. Though I could accommodate this energy well enough in the short term, my body was having increasing difficulty managing it in the long term. My system was simply running too hot. Eventually, I realized that I had to stop plunging myself into the fire of Pure Radiance, no matter how much! longed to be there. I had to let my system cool down. I had to let my physical being integrate more completely what it had already received. William Blake wrote, “You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.” My body was telling me that seventy-three high-dose sessions was more than enough.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §0 ¶7**

> I think it’s better to bundle these early experiences of the ocean of suffering together rather than take you through them session by entire session. Concentrating them into a few pages, however, may make them appear worse than they actually were, if that’s possible. In actual practice, the ocean of suffering was broken up into installments lasting a few hours each and separated by months in which I had time to digest them and prepare myself for the next round. Once I learned what was waiting for me inside the sessions, the mornings of a session day were tense. Like a woman going into labor or a soldier going into battle, my attention turned deeply within as I prepared for what was about to happen. Carol called it “going into the tunnel.” It would start hours, sometimes days before a session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶12 (1 · 4)**

> Metzner is trying to walk us back from the turbulent ’60s, when 500 mcg was considered the measure of “true initiation” and Terrence McKenna was promoting “heroic dosages” for those who wanted to “really get the message.” Metzner believes that this more-is-better approach brought with it too much trauma and at the very least wasted a lot of time without yielding longlasting therapeutic gains. Better to work more slowly and be able to integrate more of what one sees. Accordingly, he recommends a therapeutic dose range for LSD between 50 and 200 mcg, essentially staying within the limits of psycholytic therapy.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶11 (1 · 4)**

> In his book *Allies for Awakening*, Ralph Metzner recommends against working with doses of LSD this high. When doses are raised to this level, he says, heightened awareness flips into dissociative and/or dysphoric responses for most people. A dissociative response is one in which the individual essentially blanks out and is not able to remember or describe the experience. The experience may be pleasant, even blissful, but the person can’t bring much of it back. A dysphoric response is one in which one’s innate resistance to losing control triggers an intense struggle and possibly paranoid or schizoid reactions. The trauma of being overwhelmed overpowers any positive insights or visions one may have.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶2 (1 · 5)**

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)**

> LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶7 (1 · 8)**

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)**

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶6 (2 · 0)**

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶2 (1 · 3)**

> From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path that has been well documented by scholars. From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §0 ¶3 (11 · 0)**

> I was never in control of what happened in my sessions.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §0 ¶2 (1 · 0)**

> In this opening chapter, I want to candidly describe how I worked with LSD and share some core observations about the psychedelic process. Even as psychedelic research resumes, there is still a great deal of misinformation and mistrust of psychedelics in our culture. By putting my cards on the table up front, I hope to create as clear a field as possible for the story that follows. Readers who are not familiar with the psychedelic literature will get a solid understanding of how this method of inquiry works, while those who know this literature well will see how I have adapted and personalized it.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)**

> If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶3 (10 · 3)**

> By this time, I was a seasoned journeyer. I knew how my system responded to LSD, and I had a solid sense of the size and shape of my psychedelic window. On this day, however, my window opened wider and stayed open longer than it ever had before. In my session notes, I wrote:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶1 (1 · 7)**

> While the issue of set and setting has been much discussed in the psychedelic literature, I find less attention being paid to the issue of systematic recall after a session has ended. I don’t know why this is the case because I have found that making an accurate record of each session can pose a significant challenge. This may be because of the high doses I was working with, but I think it represents a larger issue as well.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶45 (8 · 1)**

> I have asked myself this question many times over the years, responding differently at different stages of my journey, sometimes cursing the day I started this work but more often on my knees in gratitude. It is a pressing question, especially if one works with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD, for this protocol unleashes more extreme experiences than when lower doses or milder psychedelics are used. For the time being, let me say just this.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §1 ¶1 (1 · 1)**

> I’ve never dropped acid and gone to a concert, never spent the night tripping with friends. When I took LSD on these seventy-three days, I entered a carefully constructed space dedicated to self-transformation. I was isolated from the outside world, in my home or my wife’s private office, and protected from all interruptions. I was lying down on a mattress on the floor, surrounded by cushions, and wearing eyeshades and headphones. The music was carefully selected to support the stages of opening and closing—gentle music as the drug comes on, powerful evocative music as it builds momentum, expansive music for the peak hours, and gentle music for the long, slow return.

## Supporting transcript quotes (verbatim)

> it during the course of these experiences as part of integration, or was it reflection looking back?
Chris Bache:
Reflection looking back. All my sessions were recorded within 24 hours. I had about 400 pages of notes, which I studied, blocked, took apart, reassembled, diagrammed in different ways. It took years to piece together the storyline—and decide what to leave out and what to include. I left out a lot of the personal healings and small personal things because those weren’t the important parts for this book. Everyone has a personal story; as a philosopher, the story becomes interesting when the process takes you beyond the personal psyche into the deep waters of the psyche.

> ally that model shattered when I realized the sessions went far beyond my personal psyche and karma.
Jef Baker:
Was that at the point of the “ocean of suffering,” when you experienced the collective human pain throughout history? That was honestly hard to read.

Chris Bache:
Yes. I had to think carefully about how much to expose, because it’s challenging material. But to finish that earlier point, even after I let go of the personal model, I found I liked where the high-dose work took me. It took me farther than I imagined, and I developed a taste for it. I don’t recommend that protocol. I’d do it differently now—be gentler, balance high-dose with low-dose work, and balance LSD with psilocybin, ayahuasca, more organic psychedelics. I started in ’79 and did the work between 1979 and 1999, from age 30 to 50. At the time, I pushed myself harder than I’d recommend. It’s not necessary.

Jef Baker:
In the book you acknowledge that too, which is good.

> see if I got it right. Welcome to the people who are live and those who are going to join us later.
Chris Bache—the story I know is that he is now a retired professor of religious studies and philosophy from Ohio State University and Youngstown, Ohio. Early in his career he was always interested in mysticism and deep spiritual exploration, and he came upon the work of the legendary psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, who pioneered a protocol for working with high doses of LSD in particular. Chris undertook what turned out to be a 20-year journey of 73 high-dose LSD sessions following the Stan Grof protocol—sessions using 500 to 600 micrograms of LSD, which, for any of you not familiar with that calculation, is a high dose. The protocol involves working at home or in a safe, quiet space with headphones and a carefully curated playlist, eyeshades to block out the light so inner visions aren’t obstructed, and a qualified sitter. In Chris’s case, the sitter was a therapist who knew what she was doing. Generally, he did this on a Saturday, and the following day—again following the Grof protocol—he spent basically the whole day with the headphones on to trigger memories of what was playing when certain experiences and visions occurred, and then meticulously transcribed all that.

Hi Sandy. It's a pleasure to be with you today.
Sandy Sedgbeer
You too. So Life Cycles has been hailed as the first book to both describe the dynamics of rebirth and explore the ramifications of adopting a reincarnationist perspective. Now, this was published, what, about 35 years ago?

Chris Bache
Thereabouts. I started my psychedelic work after my first year as an academic. I worked for four years, then stopped for six. During that six-year interval, I did three years of past-life therapy, uncovering and working with my own former lives, and I wrote Life Cycles. By then my psychedelic work had gone deep enough to give me personal insights into karma—the deeper cause-and-effect that underlies our lives. I hadn’t yet had former-life experiences in a psychedelic context, though I had in hypnotherapy. The real foundation for Life Cycles was studying Ian Stevenson and later other pioneers documenting children and adults with validated past-life memories.

> orced since first experiencing it in the late 1990s, to the writing of the book, to the present day?
Chris Bache: It hasn't changed one bit. I say in the book that when I had the experience in session 55—the death and rebirth of humanity in 1995—for weeks I walked around like I was walking around Hiroshima a week before the bomb went off. I have carried in my being, in my body, a knowing of where we are in history and what's coming.

When I look around, whether I agree with people politically or socially or not, I see heroes. I see every human being here on this planet as having incarnated voluntarily, choosing to be part of this evolutionary pivot. Every person here—even though they may not remember it—has chosen to be here, and this is going to be a very difficult period to incarnate. The beings who are part of the incarnation process are extraordinarily powerful, valuable beings.

> mmy Vadnais: What was the impetus for you to embark on this deep exploration with high doses of LSD?
Chris Bache: I had just finished graduate school and started my academic career. I was then a fairly convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. Then I encountered two people’s work: Ian Stevenson, whose research on reincarnation convinced me it was a simple fact of life; and Stanislav Grof. I read Grof’s Realms of the Human Unconscious in 1978, two years after it came out. I recognized it had tremendous significance not only for psychotherapy but for philosophy of religion and consciousness. I knew that if I was going to make a contribution in this field, I had to undergo my own therapeutic exploration. Very uncomfortably, I decided to break the law in what I hoped was a disciplined, restrained way and began a series of sessions that, much to my surprise, lasted 20 years. I worked for four years, stopped for six, then worked another 10, finishing in 1999. I spent the next 20 years digesting, analyzing, sifting, and sorting these experiences, and then wrote LSD and the Mind of the Universe in 2019, 20 years after I stopped my sessions.

> cosmological exploration? And how might someone structure them if they’re aimed at the other goals?
Chris Bache:
I didn’t understand much of this at the time; I understood it only after going a long way down the road and looking back at how my choices affected the trajectory. The dose decision is significant. Working with high doses, you completely surrender to the process. It’s impossible to direct it. You can set all the good intentions you want, but the states that arise with high doses, amplified by carefully selected music and internalization in a kiva-like practice, set in motion processes so powerful you can’t control them. The strategy is to surrender—let consciousness take you wherever it wants, show you whatever it wants, no matter how inscrutable, painful, or absurd it seems at the time.

> he is challenging. You’ve also said it took you 10 years to digest what you experienced in the ’90s.
Chris Bache:
When I stopped my work in ’99, I thought that, having been given so many gifts, I could simply withdraw and nourish myself by continuing to digest and assimilate them. That was true—but only half the truth. The other half was confronting the tremendous sense of loss I had from not being able to enter this deeply into communion with the universe. There was a real loss of communion because I couldn’t sustain it in my daily life. Some beings can—the great masters of meditation have always been my heroes—and they hold these experiences in an abiding way. That wasn’t the case for me. It took me about 10 years to get over my sense of loss and to recommit to being who I was, where I was, for the remainder of my life, and do as much as I could with that time.

> things, and the only way was to teach me how to stay conscious in these unusual temporal modalities.
The last of what I consider the great visions took place in the 70th session, after one of the most extreme strip-downs I went through. It moved me into the most radical deep time in all my sessions. After this vision, the universe essentially wrapped things up over the next three sessions. That dominant vision took me far into humanity’s evolutionary future.

Jef Baker: What insights did that window of deep time give you about our future direction?

Chris Bache: Starting around the 23rd session, and then in a punctuated way over the years, the universe kept giving me teachings about the human story—what you might call the master story. I don’t mean that arrogantly; it’s simply what kept coming. It emphasized we were approaching a crescendo—a true turning point, a before-and-after in our evolutionary journey. After thousands and hundreds of thousands of years of struggling—in a reincarnational framework, which I accept—the message was that humanity was coming to a decisive pivot in its larger story.

> m the usual “Who am I, what am I” type questions. These must have been working in you for some time.
Chris Bache:
For a time, yes. There were two people I met my first year of teaching. One was Ian Stevenson and his work on reincarnation research, which opened up a whole new world for me. I finished graduate school as an atheistically inclined agnostic. Ian Stevenson opened up reincarnation. Stan Grof opened up the opportunity to actually experience deeper dimensions of consciousness, and by entering those dimensions, to experience deeper dimensions of existence itself. That felt like the opportunity of a lifetime—what philosopher wouldn’t want to do that? The problem, of course, was that this was 1978, and the substances had been made illegal in the United States. The first generation of work was over, and we were forty years away from the renaissance of psychedelics that's taking place now. So I made a difficult choice—I decided to split my life. In my public life, I was a university professor: I taught, published, served on committees. In my private life, I began a private, twenty-year journey using Grof’s methods—high-dose LSD therapy, seventy-three sessions over twenty years. I worked for four years, stopped for six, and then worked very intensely for ten years. So overall, from 1979 to 1999, I did this work. But because it was illegal, if I had talked about it, I would have lost my job. I had to keep quiet about it, and it wasn't until after I retired, and after the statute of limitations had passed—because I don’t do this work now—that I was finally able to talk openly about what one can learn about consciousness and the universe by following this particular method of exploration.

> but first, could you share the protocol you followed and what the path looked like as it went along?
Chris Bache:
I was just out of graduate school in 1978 when I read Stan Grof’s first book, Realms of the Human Unconscious, published in 1976. I immediately recognized the significance of Stan’s work for my discipline, philosophy of religion. I’m not a psychologist or therapist and was never particularly interested in therapeutic applications as Stan was; I was drawn to the philosophical implications.

Recognizing a call, I began work that lasted 20 years—four years of very intense work, a six-year hiatus, then another 10 years of intense work. I chose high doses of LSD—500 to 600 micrograms. I don’t recommend this today, and if I were doing it over, I’d be gentler: lower doses and a wider spectrum of psychedelics. I chose LSD because it was the substance Stan had done most of his research on, and I trusted that research. This was 1978—pre-Ayahuasca, before the broader appreciation of organic psychedelics used in shamanic traditions.

Chris Bache: I had fun sharing this. It brings back a lot of memories. My thinking on reincarnation has evolved beyond where it was when I wrote Life Cycles. I opened a deeper level in Dark Net Early Dawn when I began bringing in the psychedelic experience, and then in LSD in the Mind of the Universe I offer my most expanded understanding, with the concept of the birth of the diamond soul in history. But it all begins with the question: do we have good, reliable evidence that any hard-nosed skeptic should endorse, whether or not they do? Dottie has a core bibliography she’ll send out—names, places, books I mentioned, plus more. The floor is open.

Chris Bache
One of the things I decided early on was not to try to address the reservations—abundantly clear to me—coming out of the traditional academic mindset. I decided that if I tried to justify the method and the experiences to my colleagues, it would hamper me. I decided to push deeply ahead and let the chips fall where they may. I understand how exotic, how strange my claims sound to people raised and educated in a traditional environment, and I've decided to let that go and let history sort things out. I'm acutely aware that I'm writing not for my present generation; I'm writing for future generations. Paradigm changes take place in an evolutionary context, so I'm just doing the work and letting other people sort out what they think it's worth.

> of this has karma embedded in it. Tell us what you learned about the essence of karma at that time.
Chris Bache:
As a professor of religious studies, I had an intellectual understanding of karma: cause and effect generated by choices. There are physical and psychological cause-effect processes. In karmic thought, every choice sets in motion events whose consequences we eventually receive. By receiving the effects, we learn and make new choices. Session 15 wasn’t theoretical; it was being shown the karma of my particular life. For a year—seven sessions—I experienced the entirety of my life, from beginning to end, as a complete totality. This was my first entry into what I call deep time. In that context, when I looked at relationships and professional issues, I saw how deeply embedded they were in karmic causal processes—that my position in history wasn’t accidental, the people around me weren’t accidental. It was a meaningful fabric. The question then became: how do you respond most effectively to the meaningful fabric your life is part of?

Ryan Kemp:
Have you been tempted in these later years to go back? You’ll know Aldous Huxley, on his deathbed, had LSD and was read the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Have you been tempted to do a high-dose session all these years later? It’s been about twenty years, hasn’t it?

Chris Bache:
Actually, he was injected with two very low doses—Laura Huxley discusses this in her autobiography. I’ve done low-dose LSD sessions since I stopped, and I’ve had wonderful experiences, but generally it doesn’t work well with me now. I pushed my system so hard with high doses that it’s as if I’ve developed an allergy. If I took a massive dose today, I wouldn’t be able to get back to where I was journeying in the last years of my work.

All my work has come from this psychedelic journey: my first book on reincarnation, the second on trend in psychedelic theory, and The Living Classroom, which is coming out in a new edition now because they wanted psychedelics woven into the story. I had kept psychedelics out of The Living Classroom, but the truth is my students—who knew nothing about my psychedelic work—began to be impacted by it, and I had to learn a new way of teaching, developing what I call a quantum pedagogy. That’s the story, and I’ll stop here.

We have a couple of questions before we go to breakout. One relates to your comments about the time period we’re in and the shift that’s occurring. It echoes Jean Gebser’s writing—and, in a different way, Nora Bateson’s questioning of stage models. Can you relate your experiences to Gebser’s view?

Chris Bache
I’ll make it easy for you: Gebser is one of those thinkers I know I should read and I haven’t, so there’s zero direct influence. Others will have to make those correlations.

> f these high-dose experiences, or did it emerge as you processed them afterward? That’s a big shift.
Chris Bache
It was a big shift, and it’s a little of both, but probably the most important part came after the sessions, as I processed and worked through them. It took years. I kept trying to fit it into Stan Grof’s paradigm and the other paradigms available at the time—which always focused on healing or enlightening the individual. I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn largely to answer the question, "Why did suffering get so large in my psychedelic sessions?" Eventually, that led me beyond the person-centered model to a collective one. My thinking has evolved since then, but that’s where the jump happened. I started the work in ’79 and wrote the book in ’95–’96, about 15 years into the process. So it took more than ten years for me to really accept and understand that idea. Once I did, a lot of other things began to make sense—how, at the collective level, after going through that “ocean of suffering”—which lasted two years—and experiencing the associated death and rebirth that led me into deeper archetypal reality, I had many experiences showing me how the species mind is alive within all our individual, fractally embedded minds; how each individual mind feeds into the collective, as Rupert Sheldrake describes, and the collective feeds back into the individual. It's a constant feedback system. Intellectually, it was integrating Rupert's morphic field theory with Stan Grof's paradigm that gave me the permission to make this radical reinterpretation...

Chris Bache:
To start at the end, my advice is: please don’t do it the way I did. I was young and foolish. I understand much more now, and I’d advise a different protocol.

How I got into this is straightforward. I came out of graduate school an atheistically inclined agnostic in philosophy of religion, with a lifelong passion to ask the big questions—why life is filled with suffering, whether there’s an intelligence expressing itself in the universe. Right after grad school I encountered Stan Grof’s work. Realms of the Human Unconscious changed my life, followed quickly by his 1980 manual, LSD Psychotherapy. I knew I wanted—needed—to do this work. I don’t like breaking the law, but I did. I went underground as part of the transitional underground generation and started high-dose work.

> this story? Maybe we can start with psychedelics—how did psychedelics come on your radar initially?
Chris Bache
I had just finished graduate school, was publishing a few articles out of my dissertation, and looking for where to take my research. I was a brand-new university professor when I met the work of Stanislav Grof, and that snapped my head to attention. I did not have a psychedelic history. I finished graduate school in religious studies as a pretty deeply convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. But I read Stan’s work and a light bulb went off. I said, this is important—not just to psychology, but to philosophy of religion, which was my training. I wanted to get involved, but it had been made illegal. So I split my life. In my day job, I functioned as a professor of religious studies, teaching conventional or semi-conventional courses. And I began what eventually became a 20-year journey working with LSD, following Stan’s paradigm and then pushing the limits of that paradigm much farther than I appreciated at the time. Trained in philosophy of religion, I kept careful records and notes, trying to make the engagement as clean and productive as possible. I knew there would come a time to share the insights with a broader audience. After I retired from the university, that time finally came.

> ople asked about those levels. And, as you said, you would go lower if you were to do it over again.
Chris Bache:
After the first three sessions, which were medium-dose, I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms—right at the body’s maximum capacity to absorb. Taking more doesn’t necessarily take you deeper. I was working at very high levels that can shatter the structures of consciousness and take you temporarily beyond your traditional ways of knowing yourself and the world. Again, I would be much gentler in the early days.

James Jesso:
Just to clarify for listeners—what would you consider a "high dose" of LSD? What was the metric?

Chris Bache:
The metric was 500 to 600 micrograms, which is a very high dose. Stan Grof differentiates between low-dose therapy (about 200 micrograms up to 300), psychedelic therapy (high dose, between 300 to 500 micrograms), but in the early work at Spring Grove Hospital, the dose was deliberately limited to a maximum of three sessions, with the idea of triggering an experience of transcendence to help people come to terms with impending death. I thought that if you could do this safely three times, you could do it more frequently. So, I saw myself as just doing an extended course of high-dose therapy.

Lauren Taus: You took 73 high-dose LSD trips over the course of 20 years—and really high dose?

I would be much gentler with myself and have a more modulated approach. But that's what I did. I started with three sessions at medium doses—about 250 micrograms—and then for the remainder I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms.

> all its levels, triggering a near-death-type experience and hopefully reducing anxiety around dying.
After a few low dose sessions, I opted for a very intense regimen with LSD. Over twenty years, I completed 73 high-dose, fully internalized, therapeutically focused psychedelic sessions, always following the same protocol, with my first wife Carol—herself a clinical psychologist—as my sitter in every session. I worked for four years, stopped for six, then worked another ten aggressive years.

I don’t recommend this protocol to others, especially such high doses. No current federal research recommends doses this high. But I wanted to push the limits, thinking that if high-dose psychedelic work could be done safely three times in the Spring Grove project, perhaps it could be done more often. I found it could, but it’s extremely demanding and brings both opportunities and challenges earlier protocols didn’t envision.

> ing at the edge of my ability, consolidating what I experienced as an important part of the process.
Looping back to why I wouldn’t do it the same way again: over the long haul, working at doses this high—responsibly and conscientiously, supplemented by other spiritual practice, yoga, meditation—is very demanding. It’s taxing. If I were doing it over, I’d be gentler with myself: balance high-dose sessions with low-dose; balance LSD, which tends to be a high-level, cosmic psychedelic, with psilocybin or ayahuasca—more body-grounded medicines—to facilitate ongoing integration of peak experiences. Hammering the high levels did open great cosmic vistas, but I was harder on myself than needed, maybe harder than was wise. It took a long time to internalize and, in some ways, recuperate from the journey.

> tocol, the key question is: What made you decide to do such large doses, given that in his protocol—
Chris Bache:
In Stan’s early work, he differentiates between psycholytic or low-dose therapy and psychedelic high-dose therapy. At Spring Grove Hospital, they developed a protocol for psychedelic therapy aiming to trigger a near-death experience in terminally ill patients, and it was limited to three sessions. I thought, if you could go into high-dose space three times safely, you could do it more times safely.

In the beginning I did high-dose work partly because it was hard to find time in a dual-career marriage—and soon there were children. To get a day we could give to this work, I still thought in terms of a personal therapeutic model. The Eastern sources I taught as a professor of religious studies said your karma is ultimately finite, even over many lifetimes. I thought I could work through mine faster by working with high doses. I knew the sessions would be hard, but if I stayed grounded and confronted the shadow, I thought I could move faster. Eventually that model shattered when I realized the sessions went far beyond my personal psyche and karma.

> d. I went underground as part of the transitional underground generation and started high-dose work.
At first, it was a matter of efficiency. I still thought in a personal-therapy model: higher doses would turn up more of my psyche, I’d clean up my stuff faster, and get to enlightenment faster. Turns out my assumptions were wrong. At high doses you activate a larger piece of the fabric of existence. What may begin as an individual transformational process becomes part of humanity’s larger collective process.

Three or four years in, when I began to understand some of this, I also discovered I had a constitution wired for high-dose work. I could get very large and spacious—and, importantly, I could contract safely at the end. Not everyone should work with psychedelics at all, and many should not work with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. Even if you have aptitude and strong support, I would be much gentler. I’d take a gentler way in, work more with lower doses, balance occasional high doses with integrating lower doses. I’d also balance LSD with psilocybin or ayahuasca—the vegetative psychedelics. There’s a lot I would do differently.

> gal reasons and partly because it took a long time to map and understand the dynamics that unfolded.
I want to say at the outset this is not a methodology I would recommend today. If I were doing it over, I’d be gentler on myself. I’d take a slower process, balancing high-dose work with low-dose sessions. I’d also balance LSD with psilocybin and ayahuasca—more body-grounded psychedelics—for a variety of reasons I discuss in the book.

> er a session. It’s one very intense day, with several days of preparation and integration around it.
After several medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at very high levels using psychedelic therapy—not low-dose psycholytic therapy. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. It’s not that I’m against occasional high doses of LSD, but consistently exploding consciousness so aggressively is not something I encourage now. I worked at 500 to 600 micrograms for 73 sessions over 20 years—on average about five sessions a year. I worked for four years, took a six-year hiatus, then worked in a very aggressive 10 years. It averaged about five sessions a year.

Can you explain the difference between psychedelic and psycholytic protocols?

> e medicines. LSD strikes me as cleaner in that respect; it doesn’t have the same programmed quality.
I don’t know what it would have been like working with low-dose LSD. I’m sure that would have been more personal and psychodynamically oriented. But at the very high doses I worked with, after the first 15 sessions or so, during the peak hours I wasn’t working in relation to my personal psyche at all. In the book, I downplay the personal story because it mostly showed up at the beginning and end of sessions—meaningful and healing for my life, but the peaks were far beyond the personal psyche.

He is a very strong proponent of these high-level doses. I struggle with his arguments around it, but yours seem quite sensible. It’s—how do we approach it?

Kyle Buller:
I'm not a proponent of high doses myself. I did this work and came through it. In the early years, the high-dose work done at Spring Grove Hospital with terminally ill patients was limited to three sessions. Low-dose psychedelic work was open-ended; high-dose work was capped at three. Going in, I thought if you could do it safely three times, you could do it safely more times. But by doing it as systematically as I did and pushing the edge as hard as I did, issues and challenges arose that hadn’t been discussed in the early literature. Opportunities for insight and understanding emerged, but so did challenges in navigating increasingly intense, vast levels of consciousness—what it does to your body and mind as you enter these realities, and how it affects people around you.

> th psilocybin and ayahuasca. I still would have taken the journey, but not as aggressively as I did.
Sandy Sedgbeer: You experienced 73 higher-dose LSD sessions following protocols established by Stanislav Grof, with the intention of engaging hyper-intensive states in a way that would allow the initial chaos at each new level to clear and also allow your biophysical and psychological systems to adapt. How did you know the precise dosage to accomplish that in the way you wanted to?

Chris Bache: Stan was very clear in his early books, and in LSD Psychotherapy published in 1980, about the differences between psycholytic (low-dose) therapy and psychedelic (high-dose) therapy. Psycholytic work typically runs in the 50–150 microgram range, while high-dose psychedelic therapy is in the several-hundred-microgram range. At that time, high-dose therapy was being used at Spring Grove Hospital in Baltimore with terminal patients to trigger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going.

> ger something approximating a near-death experience to give them a glimpse of where they were going.
I thought, if you can do this work three times safely, you can do it more than three times safely. I chose high doses for a couple of reasons. One, I had a false model of what the project was. I thought it was about personal transformation—my healing, my spiritual awakening—and that by working with high doses I’d be biting off my karma in larger pieces and clearing it faster. That turned out to be profoundly incomplete. Personal transformation was too small to describe it. Also, I wanted to be efficient. I was in a dual-career marriage; getting time for sessions was complicated, and I wanted to get as much done in every session as I could.

What I learned along the way is that because consciousness is unified at its source, when you hyper-stimulate consciousness you're not just hyper-stimulating your personal field—you’re engaging some portion of the unified field. The dynamics that get activated—healing, purification, illumination—are much larger than personal dynamics.

> ssing some of the healing work or lower-dose work? How might you use different dose ranges as tools?
Chris Bache
Any work with psychedelics—especially higher doses in a therapeutic protocol—can be challenging, and calls for good psychological screening to make sure your psyche is ready for these depths. Some people should never go near psychedelics. Some should work only very gently, if at all. I happen to have a constitution that can flow into expansive states readily and recongeal smoothly at the end. Not everybody is wired like that. All the clinical cautions apply.

Can you bypass? You can chase a level of experience and bypass others, but that didn’t happen to me. I spent the first 10 sessions—two and a half years—in very grueling work at what Stan calls the perinatal level, the interface between the personal unconscious and the collective or transpersonal.

> y things are unfolding a certain way, but it always comes out well in the end. That was my approach.
As for not recommending this work: I wouldn't work at such high doses so frequently. Not that high doses shouldn't ever be used, but I wouldn't recommend "blowing consciousness apart" so aggressively for so many sessions over so many years. Even though I was responsible—about five sessions a year, lots of time to recuperate, taking care of my body, doing spiritual practice, keeping detailed notes within 24 hours, studying those notes as methodically as possible—it was still intense. By the end of my journey, I had major breakthroughs and insights, but I realized an assumption I had held was wrong: that there is a particular goal or endpoint, whether it's oneness with God, the meta-cosmic void, or the super-cosmic void.

> a more gentle fashion. We can do a great deal of very good work without taking psychedelics at all.
In fact, many people who have written me have never taken psychedelics—or took them once or twice early in life—but have been meditators for 40 or 50 years. They compare the cosmology that emerges in my story to the cosmology that has emerged for them in meditation and find strong parallels. At the deepest level, the issue is not psychedelics; the issue is consciousness—its boundaries and functions. Some people should stay away from these powerful amplifiers.

Emmy Vadnais:
How many micrograms—what was the dose you were usually working at? After we did that interview, some people asked about those levels. And, as you said, you would go lower if you were to do it over again.

> to understand our universe as deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness as deeply as I could.
A few observations on method. Many are aware of the distinction between low-dose psychedelic therapy and high-dose psychedelic therapy that Stan developed. Low-dose therapy peels the mind gradually, layer by layer, in very intense therapeutic encounters. High-dose therapy is a different protocol. In the early days, it was used to try to trigger a near-death experience for people with terminal cancer—not to heal them, but to open them to the world they were about to enter.

> terminally ill patients facing death. At Spring Grove Hospital, they limited this to three sessions.
I came along and thought, if it can be done safely three times, it can be done safely more than three times. It can, but it’s much more demanding than I anticipated, and it took all my resources to manage what unfolded. This is not a therapeutic journey; it’s cosmological exploration. It requires an explorer’s constitution and preparation, and a position in life that allows pushing this far beyond the maps most people use. When I finished and looked back, I realized I had to give it a different name. I call it psychedelic exploration. The method uses the protocol of psychedelic therapy—total isolation, always a sitter, carefully selected music, and so on—but the difference is the number of sessions. I did 73. Three sessions at the psychodynamic level—about 200 micrograms—and after that, all at 500–600 micrograms. This is not a protocol I recommend. I wouldn’t do it this way again. I would balance plant medicines with synthetics and only push periodically with high doses rather than so relentlessly. I have worked with psilocybin, ayahuasca, and salvia divinorum—mostly after I stopped the LSD work—but LSD and the Mind of the Universe focuses on what happened in the high-dose journey.

> could do it more frequently. So, I saw myself as just doing an extended course of high-dose therapy.
But when I got to the end of this journey and looked back, I realized what unfolded was more radical and challenging than what had emerged in early psychedelic therapy work, so I had to coin a new phrase: psychedelic exploration. The method was psychedelic therapy—totally internalized sessions, strong evocative music, working with a sitter, always in a protected, isolated environment, classic set and setting. The difference was the number of sessions: for me, it turned out to be 73.

> micrograms.

Lauren Taus: What inspired you to double the dose and continue in the way that you did?
Chris Bache: First, I saw Stan’s early work and the distinction between psycholytic therapy and psychedelic therapy, so I knew that working with high doses could be safe and managed effectively. I knew the sessions would be more difficult at that intensity, but I thought if I focused on confronting my shadow, I could work with those doses as long as I could manage the intensity. In the beginning, arranging a session day in a dual-career marriage with children was hard to do, so I wanted to make the most out of every day. After working at those levels for a while, I developed an aptitude for them. I liked where they were taking me, and I continued to press on.

Lauren Taus: For the sake of listeners who might not have as much knowledge as we do, can you name the difference between psycholytic therapy and psychedelic therapy?

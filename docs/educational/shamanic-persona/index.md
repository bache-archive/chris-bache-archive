> This educational page explores the concept of the shamanic persona, a unique synthesis of experiences that emerges through psychedelic practices. It examines how this persona evolves through various levels of consciousness and integrates transpersonal experiences, highlighting its role in navigating the complexities of human consciousness. The discussion also addresses the implications of this persona within the broader context of shamanic traditions and contemporary spiritual practices.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶10**

> Because the shamanic persona is a synthesis of a specific set of experiences, it is a specific entity with a specific identity. It is not an archetype. It is the living memory of our unique psychedelic history, and as such it has built into it the character and limitations of that history. A shamanic persona that embodies stabilized psychic level experience, for example, is a very different entity than a shamanic persona that embodies stabilized subtle level experience or causal level experience. By “stabilized experience,” I mean that we have entered a certain level of consciousness often enough that we have acclimated to the territory and learned the terrain. Our psycho-physical system has undergone the necessary purifications and adaptations for us to maintain coherent awareness and good recall at this level.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶2**

> More than any other of the human types concerned with the sacred, the shamanic personality journeys into the far regions of the cosmic mystery and brings back the vision and the power needed by the human community at the most elementary level. Not only is the shamanic personality emerging in our society, but also the shamanic dimension of the psyche itself.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶12**

> In a sustained psychedelic regimen, our shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times as new levels of reality continue to open. After ego-death, a shamanic persona emerges as the living integration of our early transpersonal experiences. As our experience continues to deepen in subsequent sessions, that first shamanic persona will eventually have to surrender and die, giving birth to a second shamanic persona that will integrate our new transpersonal experiences. This second persona will retain the memories and knowledge of the first persona and add to it the new knowledge and capacities gained at this second level. If we continue to push the boundaries of experience, sooner or later this second shamanic persona will also have to surrender in order for a still deeper dimension of consciousness to open and become fully operational.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶7**

> So it was that during the last five years of my psychedelic journey, when the work was entering its most intense phase, I integrated Vajrayana practice into my psychedelic practice. I had always been a meditator, but this represented a more formal commitment to a specific lineage of dharma transmission. I was comfortable with most of Buddhist thought—not the patriarchy—and many of its teachings had been confirmed in my sessions. Vajrayana Buddhism is sometimes described as a synthesis of the sage tradition of Indian Buddhism and the shamanic Bon tradition indigenous to Tibet. Shamanism, therefore, is built into its very fabric. Perhaps this is why combining Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice always felt natural to me.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶3**

> In my university courses, I often called the sacred medicine path the *path of temporary immersion* and contrasted it with the *path of meditation*. Where meditation is a path of self-clarification that allows the layers of the mind to open gradually, the sacred medicine path cultivates intense but temporary surges of awareness. By amplifying our present awareness, the medicine path opens us more quickly to a deeper communion with the universe. This is a good thing, a healing thing, but it can also bea tricky thing because it’s easy to overestimate the staying power of these dramatic exercises. To use Abraham Maslow’s vocabulary, we can overestimate the value of our *peak experiences* and underestimate the challenge of achieving more stable *plateau experiences*. Or as Ken Wilber reminds us, *states* of consciousness are not *stages* of spiritual development.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶116**

> What “I” was at this point is difficult to describe. The hours of painful cleansing had already shattered my egoic reality and left me in an extremely porous transpersonal state. As we approached the arena, the procession was stopped at regular intervals and interrogated. In order to be allowed to continue, one had to demonstrate one’s knowledge of the workings of the universe. My work and my person were being scrutinized. I was surprised to find that I appeared to possess the required knowledge, as I was always passed along. This was a deeply moving experience. It felt like I was being initiated into a shamanic fellowship, that my entire life had been planned toward this end.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §10 ¶6**

> At the *psychic level* of transpersonal experience, consciousness expands beyond physical reality into nonphysical or spiritual reality, but our experience of this reality still tends to be constrained by conditioning that carries over from our spacetime experience. Inside space-time, for example, we experience life to be composed of separate beings, and psychic level transpersonal experience tends to mirror this assumption. At this level of consciousness, we often experience ourselves as distinct spiritual beings in the company of other distinct beings. There is an “atomistic” quality to the experience, a “soul-centric” quality, and the soul we experience at this level tends to be the spiritual self of our present life, our “discarnate self,” as it is sometimes called.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶9**

> I know it sounds arrogant to speak on such a scale, but I must if lam to describe the visions that repeatedly came through my sessions. Ego-death destroys the existential isolation and constant self-referencing that organizes our ordinary experience of the world. When the partitions of personal consciousness are surrendered, our experience spontaneously opens to the larger rhythms of life that we are part of. One portion of these rhythms is the collective psyche of our species. At the subtle level of consciousness, we can dissolve into the human species-mind so deeply that the beginnings and endings of our personal life become insignificant. When the “small-self” opens to the “species-self” this completely, it is only natural that insights into humanity’s larger developmental trajectory sometimes emerge in our awareness. We would be surprised if this did not happen.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §10 ¶5**

> In these respects, my view of the collective unconscious has been influenced by Rupert Sheldrake and his work on morphic fields and formative causation, which I have found to be deeply congruent with my psychedelic experience. From Sheldrake’s perspective, the collective psyche, or species-mind, influences its individual members, as Jung suggests. But Sheldrake goes further than Jung in proposing that the collective psyche also receives and integrates the learning of its members. Sheldrake envisions a complex feedback loop operating between the species-mind and individuals that allows the species-mind to learn as its members learn. Collective learning progresses more slowly than individual learning, but when the species-mind eventually grasps a truth, the resulting shift ripples through the entire species resulting in faster learning curves.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶4**

> I wrote *Dark Night, Early Dawn* in part to answer the question: Why did death become as large as it did in my psychedelic journey? What is driving the healing process when it opens to such collective tracts? In that book, I abandoned the person-centered narrative I had been assuming and adopted an expanded narrative. By integrating Rupert Sheldrake’s concept of morphic fields into Grof’s paradigm, the way opened to viewing these collective ordeals as part of a larger transformational process aimed at healing wounds still carried in the collective psyche. I argued that in highly energized psychedelic states, the collective unconscious is sometimes activated to such a degree or in such a manner that it triggers a *collective* healing process. Through some fractal flip or quantum entanglement I had not anticipated or even thought possible at the time, the “patient” in my sessions had shifted from being me to being some portion of humanity itself.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §1 ¶1**

> When I first entered archetypal reality, my identity as ahuman being began to fall away from me. I found that we have a sense of being human that is more basic than our sense of being a specific human. It is a felt sense of species identity that we share with all human beings beneath the details of our individual identity. In following the flow of existence back into archetypal reality, I had to cease to exist not only as a specific person but as a human being per se. This required a deeper surrender than ego-death. At first I struggled to hold on to my humanity for it had been the context for every experience I had ever had, but I could not stop what was happening. The pull was too strong. Eventually, I could no longer fit myself back into the form of Homo sapiens.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶24**

> While these kinds of responses might be expected in certain types of courses, such as a counseling course, this was not the case for the kinds of courses I was teaching, which were Introduction to World Religions, Religion and the Earth, Psychology of Religion, Transpersonal Studies, and Buddhism. It was not the content of the course that seemed to be driving these effects but something deeper. What was triggering these effects was not what I was doing but what I had become through my psychedelic practice. Because of this work, my core energy was changing. A field of energy moving through me or around me was growing stronger, causing a spontaneous *energetic resonance* to spring up between me and my students underneath the exchange of ideas in the classroom.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §3 ¶1**

> My encounter with the Living Forces of archetypal reality at the high subtle level seemed to awaken in me a capacity to experience the sinews of humanity’s collective being at a lower subtle level. Or perhaps this is simply where I was directed next. I think that the most important insights I received in these eleven sessions came from this more Jungian level. More significant than my brief contact with the largely inscrutable powers of high archetypal reality, being immersed in the tissue of humanity’s collective being showed me organic processes operating beneath the surface of our individual lives and weaving humanity into a larger whole. It was as though I was being taught to recognize the living tissue of our species. My experiences affirmed Jung’s core insight of the existence of a collective unconscious, but I did not experience the archetypes that he discusses, such as the mother, father, child, wise old man, trickster, or hero. I’m not suggesting these are not part of the collective psyche, just that they were not part of my experience of it.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶8**

> Moving to a model of collective transformation represented an enormous transition for me because with this pivot we are no longer speaking of an individual “having transpersonal experiences.” Here the individual dissolves into preexisting fields of collective consciousness. *At this point, it is these collective fields that become the “working unit” of experience in these sessions.* This requires a new way of thinking about what is taking place in our sessions and a new therapeutic calculus. In letting go of the person-centered narrative, I was surrendering to a universe whose workings were stranger and more complex than I had previously imagined.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶10**

> Let me step back and say this more carefully. There is an important set of insights that emerges from gathering and analyzing the psychedelic experiences of large numbers of people, and this does require lifting experiences out of their original context. This has been one of Stan Grof’s invaluable contributions. By phenomenologically mapping the psychedelic experiences of hundreds if not thousands of people, Stan has established the ontological validity of the transpersonal territory. A different set of insights emerges when we follow one person through this territory. Without this collective database, the individual’s journey could be written off as being merely a private fantasy. Against the background of this collective database, however, tracking one person through this terrain brings out certain features of the psychedelic process more sharply: the multiple stages of initiation, the deepening spiral of death and rebirth, and the participatory dynamics of psychedelic disclosure. It is this work for which context is vital. Each of these perspectives complements and strengthens the other.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶29**

> From one perspective, I was melting a collective META-COEX of fear in the species-mind. From another perspective, I was engaged in shamanic combat with demons of fear, but what strange combat this was. Here one “conquers” by surrendering, by making oneself vulnerable to what surrounds you. I kept holding still and opening, taking into myself whatever presented itself in my experience, opening to wave after wave of fear, always searching for some sign of its origin but finding none.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §4 ¶1**

> While I experienced subtle level reality as being more real than space-time reality, I want to add that just because something manifests at the subtle level of consciousness does not mean that it is real in the deepest sense of the term. For example, when someone experiences a particular deity in their sessions exactly as it is described in a culture’s scriptural tradition—holding traditional ritual objects or wearing traditional regalia—I believe they are experiencing one of two things: either a collective thoughtform or a spiritual presence wearing the clothes of a collective thoughtform. Either way, both reflect the strong influence of the collective psyche, and this places the experience at the subtle level of consciousness.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §7 ¶3**

> To think of reincarnation exclusively in terms of the individual soul is to be caught in a kind of atomistic thinking characteristic of *psychic level* discourse, where one experiences the spiritual world as being composed of separate spiritual beings. It is not that this reality is false, but when consciousness opens to the subtle level of reality, the connective tissue of life begins to stand out more. At this deeper level, individual souls can sometimes be experienced as cells in a larger *species soul*. These are not alternative truths but simultaneous truths reflecting different layers of the complex fabric of existence.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶6**

> Like Pahnke, many journeyers have reported being flooded with a supernatural radiance after going through ego-death. As one moves into still deeper levels of transpersonal experience, one encounters fields nested within fields of light. Each step beyond matter, beyond the soul, beyond the collective psyche, and beyond archetypal reality takes us deeper into a living ecology of light. Eventually, one discovers that the entire universe floats in an Ocean of Radiance.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §2 ¶8**

> My working assumption became that these collective ordeals represented a deepening of my personal ego-death, that they were a challenging phase of my *individual* spiritual journey, which I simply had to weather in order to be completely liberated. This assumption was reinforced by the fact that in-between my sessions, my ego, though softened, was still intact, with many of its failings and idiosyncrasies in place. If ego-death had already completed itself inside my sessions, I reasoned, shouldn't I be more liberated outside my sessions? The fact that I was not completely liberated in my day-to-day life suggested that there were still fragments of ego alive within me, potentially driving these ordeals. I assumed that when my ego-death process was complete, these collective ordeals would stop because there would no longer be a core of unfinished ego-death for them to attach to.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶8 (1)**

> I want to suggest that in the repeated opening and closing of consciousness in our sessions, a semiautonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed that retains and integrates all our psychedelic experiences, including those that our egoic self cannot retain. This consciousness not only remembers our experiences, it also preserves the knowledge and capacities we acquired in them. I call this psychedelically generated self-awareness the shamanic persona. The shamanic persona reflects the natural aggregating function of life. Life remembers and holds on to its experience at all levels, as Rupert Sheldrake and Ervin Laszlo have argued. The shamanic *persona* can be thought of as a state-specific alter ego. In calling this entity the shamanic persona, I am not suggesting that it has a masking function but am simply drawing attention to the fact that it is a living identity that changes as our psychedelic experience deepens. It could also be called the *shamanic self*.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶12 (1)**

> In a sustained psychedelic regimen, our shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times as new levels of reality continue to open. After ego-death, a shamanic persona emerges as the living integration of our early transpersonal experiences. As our experience continues to deepen in subsequent sessions, that first shamanic persona will eventually have to surrender and die, giving birth to a second shamanic persona that will integrate our new transpersonal experiences. This second persona will retain the memories and knowledge of the first persona and add to it the new knowledge and capacities gained at this second level. If we continue to push the boundaries of experience, sooner or later this second shamanic persona will also have to surrender in order for a still deeper dimension of consciousness to open and become fully operational.

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

> From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path that has been well documented by scholars. From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)**

> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)**

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)**

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)**

> If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?

> This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.

> At the same time, I think that there is a legitimate role for working judiciously with high doses of LSD in carefully managed sessions conducted in a safe and protected environment. It’s certainly true that high doses tend to overwhelm one’s psychological defenses and shatter one’s egoic identity, but whether this leads to dissociation and dysphoria depends to a great extent on how one engages one’s sessions. The dismantling of one’s psychological boundaries is a frightening, gutwrenching experience both physically and psychologically, but *if you are prepared for this unraveling and meet it head-on*, it can be both manageable and beneficial.

> In deep psychedelic work, *one learns by becoming*. This is especially true when working with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. We cannot transport the egoic self into these depths where it can then “have an experience” of how the world works there. In order to know the universe at these levels, we must *become* a citizen of these levels. We must *become* the levels themselves. To do this, our smaller sense of self must cease to be the container of our experience. It must die. Giving up everything is simply the price of inheriting everything else.

> For psychedelics to have their deepest impact on our culture, it is not sufficient for us to simply record the powerful experiences they unleash. We must also ground these experiences in critical discourse and place them in dialogue with other fields of learning where possible. For this reason, when I presented this session in *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, I unpacked its assertions about the role the collective psyche will play in humanity’s awakening as carefully and systematically as I could. These assertions are:

> I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics and the reservations some teachers have about them as agents of spiritual transformation. And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.

> ity, but generally, the better run the session, the more coherent the shamanic persona that emerges.
When one begins to open to deeper levels of transpersonal reality, our earlier psychedelic history must yield to the new territory. Our previous psychedelic knowledge and the identity based on it must surrender control before a deeper mode of knowing can emerge and stabilize. What’s dying in these sessions, then, is sometimes the shamanic persona; its death may feel personal, but it’s not the ego—rather, a deeper individual identity birthed through previous sessions. One shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times; after the transition, the new persona retains the memories of the former and adds to them from this new, deeper level. When an even deeper level opens, the current persona must die and yield again.

> n help illuminate how our psyche manages the extreme fluctuations that occur in psychedelic therapy.
Specifically, I want to suggest that, through repeatedly opening and closing awareness in psychedelic sessions, a semi-autonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed, retaining and integrating the knowledge and capacities developed. I call this the shamanic persona—a psychedelically generated, state-specific alter ego. There are many variables influencing its integrity, but generally, the better run the session, the more coherent the shamanic persona that emerges.

> method is deeply interesting. Could you start by telling us what it is and what your work has been?
Chris Bache: What we share in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—with mind and soul. Now that we know how vast the physical universe is, the question becomes: how large and how deep is the mind of the universe? Just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I saw his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but to philosophy: he was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness, where the answers to the philosophical questions I carried from religious studies might lie.

> t worldview and set of assumptions about the nature of self and reality. Would you like to say more?
Chris Bache:
My first concern was that it sounded like ego gone amok—ego inflation. I had to sit with that a long time, because my experiences told me that’s not what was happening. As you said, it’s a very different worldview. In the classic individual patient model, the individual is having experiences. The individual has transpersonal experiences, and the individual is always at the center. In this model, my individual existence was completely secondary. It becomes not a matter of my being central. I got the system started, but I dissolved completely into preexisting fields of consciousness. Those fields are the dynamic force having the experiences.

That manifested not only in the ocean of suffering, but later in archetypal reality and causal oneness. In many experiences, Chris Bache was a bit player. In the book I have an appendix: what dies and is reborn? After so many deaths and rebirths, it becomes a cognitive question. What is actually dying? It feels personal. Is it just ego dying over and over?

That’s a complicated topic and better answered by someone with psychedelic experience who is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist—people with more training in pathology. It has changed some. Was it Huston Smith who said, “A mystic learns to swim in waters that the psychotic drowns in”?

Luc Briede-Cooper:
I think that was Joseph Campbell.

Chris Bache:
What we have in common is opening into a reality beyond private or personal reality—a larger expanse that can be very destructive if you’re not ready. It can be injurious, traumatic, tumultuous; it can churn things up just opening to collective dimensions. That’s why, like all psychedelic therapists, I emphasize accessing these dimensions in carefully controlled circumstances with therapeutic support. This work is not advisable for a wide range of people; it’s not universally safe. It depends on many variables. There are screening criteria to identify good candidates, and that’s just part of the regimen.

Chris Bache:
The permeability between our senses shows up in several contexts. It shows up in shamanic drumming, for example—the fluidity there. We’re such a complex blending of spirit and matter; it shows up at very broad levels and at micro levels in our sensation.

Jeffrey Mishlove:
Here’s a question from a viewer named Corey Burdick: What are some of the most powerful or inspiring examples of the emergence of the new human?

Chris Bache:
When someone lays down their life for others, that’s extraordinary. When people spend their lives helping others—bypassing self-enhancement to invest in others’ flourishing—those are symptoms of the future human.

Going beyond the collective psyche—even beyond human history—you move beyond Jung’s archetypal categories. The images and concepts of our religious history fall away—thousands of years of religious forms just fall away—and you enter states beyond gods, deities, and angelic beings. Always guidance, always an intelligence engaging me—but formless.

Luc Briede-Cooper:
I’d like to ask about the forms that can appear. “Entity encounters” is something many people search for. You explore this in the book and speak about devotion and entities. For example, someone I met described encountering Ganesh, the elephant god of Hinduism. People often ask, “What is the meaning of what I experienced?” How do you reflect on encounters with deities or recognizable forms?

Chris Bache:
I don’t consider my experiences normative. There are many medicines, many ways of using them, and many personalities engaging an infinite depth of consciousness—no single map fits all. I’m interested in others’ experiences in a nonjudgmental, supportive way.

> blows your psyche completely apart, layer by layer, until eventually you dissolve into the universe.
On Saturday morning you’re in time-space; then you blow yourself apart and dissolve. You’re not functioning as “Chris Bache having an experience.” You dissolve as Chris Bache into some stratum of existence, some field of reality. You become that reality. If you do it well, you have continuity of memory in and out, but you don’t have continuity of identity. Dissolved into these fields of consciousness, you can do things my “Chris Bache” could never do and learn things he could never learn within ordinary time-space reality. You get blown into these realities, live there for a few hours, and then the second miracle happens: you come back and re-integrate your time-space identity.

I seem to have a psychological makeup that makes both rhythms—dissolving and re-congealing—easier for me. The letting go into, and the coming back to a single human being, are both important.

Lauren Taus:
So profound. Given that you don’t recommend that, what would you advise for someone seeking to access some of these experiences?

I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.

Chris Bache:
Let’s hold the second part and address the first, because this was one of the biggest surprises of my work. First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.

What I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.

> responsible for the way we contract, largely for protection and fear. Is that a fair representation?
Chris Bache
It is, and that description fits better in the early stages, when you’re working at insights that help you understand your individual way of being in the world. I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown. The universe can only communicate to you what you have the capacity to understand.

Chris Bache:
In my experience, working at high doses, every session breaks down into two phases: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. There’s the dark, hard, death-and-dying kind of phase, and then the ecstatic phase. In reference to this work, James’ excellent talk this morning about shadow work was on point. Working as I did in a non-therapeutic modality, one of the great gifts I learned from Stan Grof is to completely, absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far as it wants to take you.

Tasshin Fogleman:
What is the word “kiva” that you used?
Chris Bache:
In the Native American Southwestern tradition, when they would do sacred ceremonies with peyote or other sacraments, a kiva is a hole in the ground with a ladder. You sit deep in this chamber around a fire; the ladder is pulled up; you stay isolated all night doing ceremony until morning, when the ladder is lowered again. I use it as a metaphor for a good psychedelic session. You’re totally isolated from the world. You don’t get up and move around or talk a lot. Whatever you’re confronting is coming from within or through yourself, not being triggered by outside stimuli.

Tasshin Fogleman:
There’s a question on my mind about your work. It’s almost as if you’re presenting cosmological findings. I find them persuasive and consistent with my own explorations, but why should someone take these findings seriously as saying something about the nature of reality, rather than just an inner adventure?

Civilizations have known this; Indigenous peoples have known it for millennia. Ayahuasca in South America goes back at least 1,500 years. Peyote, mescaline, mushrooms—Indigenous people have used these to open spiritual communion for millennia. We’re catching up, and Indigenous people really are our teachers in how to use these substances wisely.

Sandy Sedgbeer:
Do you ever wonder why you—why did you have this experience and not someone else?

Chris Bache:
First, many people have used these substances wisely and have had these kinds of experiences. I’m just representative of a social movement. Maybe I pushed the edge harder than most. Because of my training, maybe I wrote it down, analyzed it, and worked out the details more than most. But I don’t see myself as unique; I see myself as part of a movement.

> of that? How do we stabilize these shifts? If you had a workshop, what would you train people to do?
Chris Bache:
A big yes to your framing. We’re hardwired into the collective psyche—physically, biologically, mentally, spiritually. Everything we do registers in the collective, and the collective shapes everything we do. An extreme example: when I die, I take my psychedelic experiences with me, but the species mind keeps them too, because I was human when I had them. They become part of the human family’s experience. This is true for all of us. Harm registers; healing registers. Insights, care, compassion infuse the network of life that is the human family, and beyond.

The spiritual traditions say there’s no such thing as private spiritual practice. In Buddhism, you begin practice by cultivating bodhicitta—the aspiration to benefit all sentient beings—and end by distributing the merit to all levels of being. The trap is thinking it’s about personal enlightenment. The traditions say the opposite: it’s not about you; it’s all of us. Open your heart and mind, let the pain in, bring the healing out. We can trust that everything we do is conserved and used by other beings alive now.

I think it is, and Stan Grof’s work allows us to say it. He integrates the experiences of thousands of people; I’m only integrating mine, but my experiences fit comfortably within the larger matrix Grof has explored.

It’s a complicated answer because I want to say yes, and then immediately qualify it. These substances only amplify consciousness. They don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the mind that’s amplified is different. When an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward will, in the beginning, be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history. That’s why these substances are very helpful for healing: they evoke our unconscious, and therefore they evoke our problems—an individual experience.

Iain McNay:
So is the transformation happening within the trip, or after you come back—or both?
Chris Bache:
It’s both. And I want to say this—there’s a lot of discussion about psychedelics and enlightenment: do psychedelics lead to enlightenment? Are they counterproductive or productive? These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.

My experiences fit within the larger matrix his work has explored. It’s a complicated answer, because on one hand I want to say yes, and on the other I must qualify it. These substances amplify consciousness; they don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the amplified mind is different, and when an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward initially will be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history.

Chris Bache:
Once again, I want to emphasize that the work I did is a path of temporary immersion. Temporary immersion does not easily or conventionally lead to permanent shifts in awareness. You have to do a lot of spiritual practice before what we experience in an amplified psychedelic state can become our ordinary consciousness.

The great masters of the spiritual traditions, and of Buddhism in particular, have always been my heroes. Their teachings have been my guiding light for how to engage psychedelic states responsibly, and how to invest in them in ways that can be converted into long-term transformations of one’s baseline consciousness. Truly, all honor to the great beings of these traditions.

> nate to my individual egoic identity, and it can be stable if my experiences have been well managed.
So when I enter a psychedelic space and transition away from time and space, I enter into a familiar sense of self at a certain level of spiritual reality. I acclimate there; I learn the ropes. But if I keep pushing the edge—if the chemical is strong enough and the intent is focused enough—eventually you come to a ceiling, and at that ceiling a cost is exacted. Another round of death takes place. What’s dying is not the ego, but that shamanic persona, that second identity, because it’s a holder of a certain level of transpersonal experience. If you want to go deeper—you don’t have to, but if you do—you have to die at that lower shamanic level. The shamanic identity dies, and you transition into yet another level of reality in which the whole working of the universe is different—different rules, different phenomena, different bandwidth, so to speak. And you must acclimate to that level of reality.

> both sides of the street. In shamanic cultures, practitioners manage dark forces as well as healing.
But Carl Jung is right that nature tilts toward growth—toward us becoming larger, wiser, more intelligent. If nature is trying to bring about this pivot toward a higher form of consciousness, then despite the upheaval at political, social, and cultural levels, the deeper movement is toward truer, clearer, better, more good. Individuals who have made the transition in their own being that humanity is trying to make collectively can become seed catalysts. Their very presence helps catalyze what’s trying to emerge beneath our feet at the collective level.

Individuals have tremendous power to influence—not just physically, but subtly. Traditions have long recognized the radiance around deep practitioners. Chinese traditions valued contemplatives outside town; Christian monasteries and convents understood their practice benefits surrounding communities. I think that subtle influence will be increasing as we move forward. Beautiful.

> rs after ego-death, and it’s not simply the ego dying over and over. It’s a different kind of death.
In the appendix of LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I suggest four levels to begin addressing that question. First, our personal ego can die. Second, some aspect of the collective ego—the collective psyche—can die. Third, what I call the shamanic persona can die. That’s a complicated concept. When you’ve been on the journey a long time, each time you move into psychedelic space, you resume your shamanic persona—the living integration of all your psychedelic experiences to that point. Let’s say, after 20 sessions working at the level of the collective psyche, what I called the ocean of suffering, you stabilize a psychedelic identity that integrates your transpersonal experiences beyond physical consciousness. If you are going into a still deeper level of consciousness than you’ve ever lived before, that shamanic persona has to die—surrender—to allow a new category of experience, and a deeper shamanic persona, to emerge. So in advanced sessions, it’s not the egoic self dying; it’s the psychedelic self.

Manda Scott:
I think we've got the health warnings fairly clear on here. If you're going to work with things, work with somebody who really knows what they're doing. Me and my apprentice are working to find people we can pass others on to, because we get emails saying, “I took substance X, and basically I'm having a psychotic breakdown. What can I do?” And we're shamanic practitioners—it's not our field—so we're trying to pass this on to people who can actually help, but they're few and far between, because there are a lot more people who think they can help than the ones who can actually help.

So take great care. Find and test your people out before you decide to do something that is irreversible. Do the work beforehand, do the work during, and do the work after to integrate, integrate, integrate—and do it because you're doing it in service to life, not because you're trying to make your ego feel happy.

Well, I'm always hesitant to jump into this, because my experiences are based upon shamanic, rigorous use of LSD. When people hear LSD, they think the ’60s, hallucinations—this is very far from that. This is within a therapeutic tradition, within Stan Grof’s tradition: the systematic use of these very hyper-intense states of awareness. When you engage these states, there are cycles of tremendous purification—tremendous death and rebirth, death and rebirth. If you go through it often enough, deeply enough, there is a progressive initiation into deeper and deeper levels of reality, and eventually you come out with a certain understanding, at least, of the larger structure of the nature of reality. It's not easy to summarize, but I’ve tried to do it in this book I’m just finishing, Diamonds from Heaven, to describe the progression.

> the collective psyche. He further proposes that deeper journeys often move beyond entity-populated,
granular realms into vaster, less individuated fields of consciousness. Alongside sacred forms, powerful secular

aggregates—like greed or anger—operate similarly as collective thought forms.

HOST: At an integration circle, someone told me he encountered Ganesh, the elephant god of Hinduism. After your journeys, how do you understand the meaning of meeting a deity in a particular form?

CHRIS BACHE: When we experience realities beyond our ordinary consciousness and tap qualities like infinite compassion, infinite intelligence, and infinite creativity—qualities long associated with deities—it is not surprising that our psyche matches the phenomenology of the experience with the qualities of deities we know. Sometimes, however, we meet deities that are not part of our lineage and perhaps not even in our awareness. They can appear completely out of left field, yet take the recognizable cultural form of a deity—Ganesh, Jesus, Mary, the Prophet Muhammad, and others.

> ine, 5-MeO-DMT, and DMT all have ranges. LSD has a range too, and of course doses affect that range.
I tend to experience psilocybin as very body-grounded, tuned to my emotional body. It opens a range, but it stays, in a sense, within parameters. It stretches but does not shatter as aggressively as LSD the parameters of individual identity—though it can dissolve and soften them, and open things up. In my work with high doses of LSD, all of these things happen, but because of the particular intensity of the substance and its lack of anthropological history—therefore lacking the fields associated with psilocybin and mescaline/peyote—it tends to shatter our time-space identity and throw us into a level of experience beyond that reality, into a spiritual reality. If we go back to that place again and again, our experience there begins to congeal, and we develop an alternative identity persona. I call it the shamanic persona—an identity comprised of all my experiences at that level of transpersonal reality. It’s superordinate to my individual egoic identity, and it can be stable if my experiences have been well managed.

> he shamans shout: all my relations. All other levels of reality, all other beings, are my relations.
We may not be able to adequately conceptualize this essence—the Atman, the Brahman—but we can tune to it. We can let it suffuse our being. We can let go of anything that keeps us smaller than it, and we can regularly cultivate the practice of tuning to it. That’s only partly intellectual; it’s more of a tuning exercise. We can do it without having an adequate understanding of the final goal. There’s a sense of peace and harmony, an infinite challenge, but a profound alignment that comes into our person and relationships the closer we draw to that reality. We can do all of that without solid answers about the nature of ultimate reality.

Luc Briede-Cooper: Got it. I mean, not really got it, but I’m glimpsing it. What comes to mind is the distinction between process-oriented spiritual practice or religion, and goal-oriented practice. Is that useful?

Manda Scott
Can I interrupt you? This is already opening doors, and I'd like to go down a few of them. We're talking about integrating with other systems, and in the book you were becoming quite deeply involved in some Buddhist practices—were they Buddhist, I think? Within the shamanic world, we see a lot of people who want to go off and do ayahuasca or mushrooms, and it seems to me they're short-cutting—not universally; I’ve spoken to people who are absolutely prepared to go and spend six months in the forest alone with the plants and integrate it—but there are an equal number who think they can go from point A to point Z without actually doing the steps in between.

> a therapeutic story, personal details are very important. In a cosmological story, they’re less so.
In this regimen one undergoes many deaths and many rebirths. Everything below the line in the image I used is time-space reality; the drop at the end represents our individual time-space identity, our egoic identity. The first transition is the death-rebirth that takes place when we move into spiritual reality—ego death. It gets a lot of attention in the literature, but less attention is given to deeper deaths at deeper levels. Stan Grof uses the vocabulary of psychic-level transpersonal experience, subtle-level transpersonal experience, causal-level experience, because the universe reveals itself in layers. Every time one goes into a deeper level of consciousness, everything known up to that time—including what you know to be true from previous psychedelic experiences—must be surrendered if a truly new and novel dimension is going to open.

> lective psyche, into archetypal reality—each requires a different pattern of dying and being reborn.
I use Stan Grof’s categories—psychic (high/low), subtle (high/low), causal. They’re convenient but necessarily rough; how can six categories capture the full spectrum of divine experience? They’re useful to mark transitions on this journey. These cycles are like tori: you break through, expand into a new level, gather in, blow through to another level, stabilize competencies in that state, gather again, and then, if you follow the process, another death-rebirth into a deeper level.

One way I image this is with a nuclear explosion—not to dwell on the horror it represents, but to make a point: deep death-rebirth shatters everything you’ve known and drops you deeper into the universe, revealing levels previously outside awareness. In an explosion, deeper atmospheric layers become visible; likewise, deep psychedelic work brings levels into awareness that were always there. Dissolve the dualism in that image: you’re not separate from the strata you enter; you dissolve into that field. We’re not talking about bombs; we’re talking about the cosmos exploring itself.

There is an organizational structure—a species consciousness—and the unresolved wounds of history remain not only at an individual soul level but at the species level. All the wars, the terrible things we’ve done to each other—the trauma, to the extent it’s not healed, resides as unfinished business in the collective psyche. Every spiritual practitioner who goes deeply enough, whatever their method, is often given an invitation, if they choose, to lift some of that suffering—not just from their personal life but from the collective psyche. For reasons I think are soul-choice, that became a large part of my work. There’s nothing special here. Any mother who sees a child suffering will try to alleviate it. Any father worth his salt will try to help a suffering child. If we’re given the opportunity, we try to help others in pain. That’s the normal working of life.

In this work, what unfolded was a multiple series of deaths and rebirths. The line represents the border of time-space; the drop below the line is egoic reality—our individual time-space consciousness. The first death and rebirth, the one most discussed in the literature, is ego death when we transition from ordinary consciousness into early transpersonal consciousness. But if you keep pressing the limits, there are other deaths at other levels of consciousness. I follow Stan Grof in using the vocabulary of psychic, subtle, and causal reality to describe some of these deeper levels. I don’t have a vested interest in how many levels there are or how many times the circle turns. What’s important is the principle: if one pushes deeper and does this work systematically, a series of deaths and rebirths opens.

The cork is out of the genie’s bottle. The academy is exploring psychedelics seriously again. We can’t deny the scale of transpersonal and parapsychological experiences people report, and we should investigate them openly, at face value, rather than just trying to explain them away.

Daniel Pinchbeck:
My understanding is that psychic and paranormal effects are extremely difficult to study under traditional methods. I’ve heard that even when an effect seems demonstrated at first, with repeat experiments the correlation goes down—as if there’s a secret that protects itself, that doesn’t want to be known.

> is, I think, a story we all share. It's closer to a collective inheritance or a cosmological story.
When you do this work, you go through many cycles of death and rebirth—not just ego death. The diagram I use starts below the “cross line,” representing ego, and marks the first death-rebirth cycle with astrological glyphs, out of respect for Rick Tarnas and Stan Grof’s insight into the correlations between astrological transits and non-ordinary experiences—insights my own sessions sometimes affirm, but not always entirely. That first death-rebirth happens at what Stan calls the perinatal level of consciousness. From there, one moves into deeper and deeper states, with death and rebirth recurring at each level and drawing you further and further into reality. Stan Grof, following Ken Wilber, describes these levels as psychic, subtle, and causal. I don't have a strong opinion on what exact scale to use; there are thousands of dimensions of consciousness. The important thing is just to recognize the vast range of transpersonal states, and that entry into each involves a cost—a surrender. At the outset, what’s asked is the surrender of your ego, but deeper surrenders occur as you continue the journey.

At a lower level of archetypal reality—call it a Jungian level—I repeatedly experienced the human psyche and the human species as a single integrated organism, with physical and mental networks connecting it like neurology. I was shown how the individual is hardwired and soft-wired into this matrix, how the species mind informs our individual consciousness, and how our individual work reaches out to inform and structure future species consciousness. I saw that each of us carries a holographic, fractal piece of the diseases of our time—mental and physical—and as we heal ourselves, we contribute to healing the collective psyche. In that sense, you could say the collective psyche is more real than the individual psyche, though I’d put it differently: the individual is real; the collective is real. They operate on different scales and are mutually implicated. And both are transcended by Platonic, archetypal levels radically beyond our human collective psyche.

> transcendence—not two separate realities but coexistent in our lives. That is embodied spirituality.
Aviv Shahar:
One way to describe this is that we’re engaged in the project of spiritualizing this world. We don’t need to go to another world to gain the spiritual experience; we’re in physical form to help spiritualize this one. Part of your report from these journeys is the validation that we’ve entered a time when you don’t need to be a high lama or special priest—this is an invitation for humanity at large, each in our own way, to participate in the fellowship of learning and become involved in the evolutionary project. I’d like you to describe the relationship between personal awakening and collective awakening—how you went through cycles of death and rebirth, their significance, and how they facilitate collective awakening.

> Christopher M. Bache is a scholar whose work explores the intersections of consciousness, psychedelics, and transpersonal experiences. He proposes the concept of the "shamanic persona," a semi-autonomous consciousness that emerges during psychedelic sessions and integrates various levels of experience. Bache's research emphasizes the participatory nature of visionary encounters and situates contemporary psychedelic practices within a historical context of spiritual exploration. His insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the psychological and cosmological dimensions of human experience.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶8 (1)**

> I want to suggest that in the repeated opening and closing of consciousness in our sessions, a semiautonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed that retains and integrates all our psychedelic experiences, including those that our egoic self cannot retain. This consciousness not only remembers our experiences, it also preserves the knowledge and capacities we acquired in them. I call this psychedelically generated self-awareness the shamanic persona. The shamanic persona reflects the natural aggregating function of life. Life remembers and holds on to its experience at all levels, as Rupert Sheldrake and Ervin Laszlo have argued. The shamanic *persona* can be thought of as a state-specific alter ego. In calling this entity the shamanic persona, I am not suggesting that it has a masking function but am simply drawing attention to the fact that it is a living identity that changes as our psychedelic experience deepens. It could also be called the *shamanic self*.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶12 (1)**

> In a sustained psychedelic regimen, our shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times as new levels of reality continue to open. After ego-death, a shamanic persona emerges as the living integration of our early transpersonal experiences. As our experience continues to deepen in subsequent sessions, that first shamanic persona will eventually have to surrender and die, giving birth to a second shamanic persona that will integrate our new transpersonal experiences. This second persona will retain the memories and knowledge of the first persona and add to it the new knowledge and capacities gained at this second level. If we continue to push the boundaries of experience, sooner or later this second shamanic persona will also have to surrender in order for a still deeper dimension of consciousness to open and become fully operational.

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

> More than any other of the human types concerned with the sacred, the shamanic personality journeys into the far regions of the cosmic mystery and brings back the vision and the power needed by the human community at the most elementary level. Not only is the shamanic personality emerging in our society, but also the shamanic dimension of the psyche itself.

> From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path that has been well documented by scholars. From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)**

> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)**

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)**

> If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?

> I know it sounds arrogant to speak on such a scale, but I must if lam to describe the visions that repeatedly came through my sessions. Ego-death destroys the existential isolation and constant self-referencing that organizes our ordinary experience of the world. When the partitions of personal consciousness are surrendered, our experience spontaneously opens to the larger rhythms of life that we are part of. One portion of these rhythms is the collective psyche of our species. At the subtle level of consciousness, we can dissolve into the human species-mind so deeply that the beginnings and endings of our personal life become insignificant. When the “small-self” opens to the “species-self” this completely, it is only natural that insights into humanity’s larger developmental trajectory sometimes emerge in our awareness. We would be surprised if this did not happen.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶5 (6 · 1)**

> This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §4 ¶14 (1 · 4)**

> At the same time, I think that there is a legitimate role for working judiciously with high doses of LSD in carefully managed sessions conducted in a safe and protected environment. It’s certainly true that high doses tend to overwhelm one’s psychological defenses and shatter one’s egoic identity, but whether this leads to dissociation and dysphoria depends to a great extent on how one engages one’s sessions. The dismantling of one’s psychological boundaries is a frightening, gutwrenching experience both physically and psychologically, but *if you are prepared for this unraveling and meet it head-on*, it can be both manageable and beneficial.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶10 (1 · 8)**

> Let me step back and say this more carefully. There is an important set of insights that emerges from gathering and analyzing the psychedelic experiences of large numbers of people, and this does require lifting experiences out of their original context. This has been one of Stan Grof’s invaluable contributions. By phenomenologically mapping the psychedelic experiences of hundreds if not thousands of people, Stan has established the ontological validity of the transpersonal territory. A different set of insights emerges when we follow one person through this territory. Without this collective database, the individual’s journey could be written off as being merely a private fantasy. Against the background of this collective database, however, tracking one person through this terrain brings out certain features of the psychedelic process more sharply: the multiple stages of initiation, the deepening spiral of death and rebirth, and the participatory dynamics of psychedelic disclosure. It is this work for which context is vital. Each of these perspectives complements and strengthens the other.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶6 (1 · 12)**

> In deep psychedelic work, *one learns by becoming*. This is especially true when working with high doses of a powerful psychedelic like LSD. We cannot transport the egoic self into these depths where it can then “have an experience” of how the world works there. In order to know the universe at these levels, we must *become* a citizen of these levels. We must *become* the levels themselves. To do this, our smaller sense of self must cease to be the container of our experience. It must die. Giving up everything is simply the price of inheriting everything else.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §3 ¶1 (9 · 3)**

> For psychedelics to have their deepest impact on our culture, it is not sufficient for us to simply record the powerful experiences they unleash. We must also ground these experiences in critical discourse and place them in dialogue with other fields of learning where possible. For this reason, when I presented this session in *Dark Night, Early Dawn*, I unpacked its assertions about the role the collective psyche will play in humanity’s awakening as carefully and systematically as I could. These assertions are:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶13 (10 · 3)**

> I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics and the reservations some teachers have about them as agents of spiritual transformation. And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.

> ity, but generally, the better run the session, the more coherent the shamanic persona that emerges.
When one begins to open to deeper levels of transpersonal reality, our earlier psychedelic history must yield to the new territory. Our previous psychedelic knowledge and the identity based on it must surrender control before a deeper mode of knowing can emerge and stabilize. What’s dying in these sessions, then, is sometimes the shamanic persona; its death may feel personal, but it’s not the ego—rather, a deeper individual identity birthed through previous sessions. One shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times; after the transition, the new persona retains the memories of the former and adds to them from this new, deeper level. When an even deeper level opens, the current persona must die and yield again.

> n help illuminate how our psyche manages the extreme fluctuations that occur in psychedelic therapy.
Specifically, I want to suggest that, through repeatedly opening and closing awareness in psychedelic sessions, a semi-autonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed, retaining and integrating the knowledge and capacities developed. I call this the shamanic persona—a psychedelically generated, state-specific alter ego. There are many variables influencing its integrity, but generally, the better run the session, the more coherent the shamanic persona that emerges.

> method is deeply interesting. Could you start by telling us what it is and what your work has been?
Chris Bache: What we share in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—with mind and soul. Now that we know how vast the physical universe is, the question becomes: how large and how deep is the mind of the universe? Just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I saw his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but to philosophy: he was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness, where the answers to the philosophical questions I carried from religious studies might lie.

> the collective psyche. He further proposes that deeper journeys often move beyond entity-populated,
granular realms into vaster, less individuated fields of consciousness. Alongside sacred forms, powerful secular

aggregates—like greed or anger—operate similarly as collective thought forms.

HOST: At an integration circle, someone told me he encountered Ganesh, the elephant god of Hinduism. After your journeys, how do you understand the meaning of meeting a deity in a particular form?

CHRIS BACHE: When we experience realities beyond our ordinary consciousness and tap qualities like infinite compassion, infinite intelligence, and infinite creativity—qualities long associated with deities—it is not surprising that our psyche matches the phenomenology of the experience with the qualities of deities we know. Sometimes, however, we meet deities that are not part of our lineage and perhaps not even in our awareness. They can appear completely out of left field, yet take the recognizable cultural form of a deity—Ganesh, Jesus, Mary, the Prophet Muhammad, and others.

> t worldview and set of assumptions about the nature of self and reality. Would you like to say more?
Chris Bache:
My first concern was that it sounded like ego gone amok—ego inflation. I had to sit with that a long time, because my experiences told me that’s not what was happening. As you said, it’s a very different worldview. In the classic individual patient model, the individual is having experiences. The individual has transpersonal experiences, and the individual is always at the center. In this model, my individual existence was completely secondary. It becomes not a matter of my being central. I got the system started, but I dissolved completely into preexisting fields of consciousness. Those fields are the dynamic force having the experiences.

That manifested not only in the ocean of suffering, but later in archetypal reality and causal oneness. In many experiences, Chris Bache was a bit player. In the book I have an appendix: what dies and is reborn? After so many deaths and rebirths, it becomes a cognitive question. What is actually dying? It feels personal. Is it just ego dying over and over?

> with psychedelic visions. I’m curious: did your sense of mental illness change after your journeys?
Chris Bache:
That’s a complicated topic and better answered by someone with psychedelic experience who is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist—people with more training in pathology. It has changed some. Was it Huston Smith who said, “A mystic learns to swim in waters that the psychotic drowns in”?

Luc Briede-Cooper:
I think that was Joseph Campbell.

Chris Bache:
What we have in common is opening into a reality beyond private or personal reality—a larger expanse that can be very destructive if you’re not ready. It can be injurious, traumatic, tumultuous; it can churn things up just opening to collective dimensions. That’s why, like all psychedelic therapists, I emphasize accessing these dimensions in carefully controlled circumstances with therapeutic support. This work is not advisable for a wide range of people; it’s not universally safe. It depends on many variables. There are screening criteria to identify good candidates, and that’s just part of the regimen.

Emmy Vadnais:

Chris Bache:
The permeability between our senses shows up in several contexts. It shows up in shamanic drumming, for example—the fluidity there. We’re such a complex blending of spirit and matter; it shows up at very broad levels and at micro levels in our sensation.

Jeffrey Mishlove:
Here’s a question from a viewer named Corey Burdick: What are some of the most powerful or inspiring examples of the emergence of the new human?

Chris Bache:
When someone lays down their life for others, that’s extraordinary. When people spend their lives helping others—bypassing self-enhancement to invest in others’ flourishing—those are symptoms of the future human.

> ined formless, seldom adopting concrete form—because forms would change as the experiences deepened.
Going beyond the collective psyche—even beyond human history—you move beyond Jung’s archetypal categories. The images and concepts of our religious history fall away—thousands of years of religious forms just fall away—and you enter states beyond gods, deities, and angelic beings. Always guidance, always an intelligence engaging me—but formless.

Luc Briede-Cooper:
I’d like to ask about the forms that can appear. “Entity encounters” is something many people search for. You explore this in the book and speak about devotion and entities. For example, someone I met described encountering Ganesh, the elephant god of Hinduism. People often ask, “What is the meaning of what I experienced?” How do you reflect on encounters with deities or recognizable forms?

Chris Bache:
I don’t consider my experiences normative. There are many medicines, many ways of using them, and many personalities engaging an infinite depth of consciousness—no single map fits all. I’m interested in others’ experiences in a nonjudgmental, supportive way.

> blows your psyche completely apart, layer by layer, until eventually you dissolve into the universe.
On Saturday morning you’re in time-space; then you blow yourself apart and dissolve. You’re not functioning as “Chris Bache having an experience.” You dissolve as Chris Bache into some stratum of existence, some field of reality. You become that reality. If you do it well, you have continuity of memory in and out, but you don’t have continuity of identity. Dissolved into these fields of consciousness, you can do things my “Chris Bache” could never do and learn things he could never learn within ordinary time-space reality. You get blown into these realities, live there for a few hours, and then the second miracle happens: you come back and re-integrate your time-space identity.

I seem to have a psychological makeup that makes both rhythms—dissolving and re-congealing—easier for me. The letting go into, and the coming back to a single human being, are both important.

Lauren Taus:
So profound. Given that you don’t recommend that, what would you advise for someone seeking to access some of these experiences?

Chris Bache:
Let’s hold the second part and address the first, because this was one of the biggest surprises of my work. First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.

What I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.

> responsible for the way we contract, largely for protection and fear. Is that a fair representation?
Chris Bache
It is, and that description fits better in the early stages, when you’re working at insights that help you understand your individual way of being in the world. I describe my work fundamentally as cosmological exploration—where not only do you leave your individual ego behind (at least temporarily), but you leave deeper and deeper levels behind and are given the opportunity to explore how the universe constructs its reality: how archetypal reality structures time-and-space reality, how oneness manifests in the diversity of all physical life forms—down to atomic, nuclear, quantum levels—how the pure void of emptiness is that mysterious, fertile essence giving birth to time and space, moment by moment. It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality. The invitation I was given was to explore how time and space are made. I often wished I had a PhD in physics or astrophysics—I could have understood so much more of what I was being shown. The universe can only communicate to you what you have the capacity to understand.

Chris Bache:
In my experience, working at high doses, every session breaks down into two phases: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. There’s the dark, hard, death-and-dying kind of phase, and then the ecstatic phase. In reference to this work, James’ excellent talk this morning about shadow work was on point. Working as I did in a non-therapeutic modality, one of the great gifts I learned from Stan Grof is to completely, absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far as it wants to take you.

Tasshin Fogleman:
What is the word “kiva” that you used?
Chris Bache:
In the Native American Southwestern tradition, when they would do sacred ceremonies with peyote or other sacraments, a kiva is a hole in the ground with a ladder. You sit deep in this chamber around a fire; the ladder is pulled up; you stay isolated all night doing ceremony until morning, when the ladder is lowered again. I use it as a metaphor for a good psychedelic session. You’re totally isolated from the world. You don’t get up and move around or talk a lot. Whatever you’re confronting is coming from within or through yourself, not being triggered by outside stimuli.

Tasshin Fogleman:
There’s a question on my mind about your work. It’s almost as if you’re presenting cosmological findings. I find them persuasive and consistent with my own explorations, but why should someone take these findings seriously as saying something about the nature of reality, rather than just an inner adventure?

Civilizations have known this; Indigenous peoples have known it for millennia. Ayahuasca in South America goes back at least 1,500 years. Peyote, mescaline, mushrooms—Indigenous people have used these to open spiritual communion for millennia. We’re catching up, and Indigenous people really are our teachers in how to use these substances wisely.

Sandy Sedgbeer:
Do you ever wonder why you—why did you have this experience and not someone else?

Chris Bache:
First, many people have used these substances wisely and have had these kinds of experiences. I’m just representative of a social movement. Maybe I pushed the edge harder than most. Because of my training, maybe I wrote it down, analyzed it, and worked out the details more than most. But I don’t see myself as unique; I see myself as part of a movement.

> of that? How do we stabilize these shifts? If you had a workshop, what would you train people to do?
Chris Bache:
A big yes to your framing. We’re hardwired into the collective psyche—physically, biologically, mentally, spiritually. Everything we do registers in the collective, and the collective shapes everything we do. An extreme example: when I die, I take my psychedelic experiences with me, but the species mind keeps them too, because I was human when I had them. They become part of the human family’s experience. This is true for all of us. Harm registers; healing registers. Insights, care, compassion infuse the network of life that is the human family, and beyond.

The spiritual traditions say there’s no such thing as private spiritual practice. In Buddhism, you begin practice by cultivating bodhicitta—the aspiration to benefit all sentient beings—and end by distributing the merit to all levels of being. The trap is thinking it’s about personal enlightenment. The traditions say the opposite: it’s not about you; it’s all of us. Open your heart and mind, let the pain in, bring the healing out. We can trust that everything we do is conserved and used by other beings alive now.

> d reach the unfolding you did? I think what you did was incredibly brave, but is it possible to say?
Chris Bache:
I think it is, and Stan Grof’s work allows us to say it. He integrates the experiences of thousands of people; I’m only integrating mine, but my experiences fit comfortably within the larger matrix Grof has explored.

It’s a complicated answer because I want to say yes, and then immediately qualify it. These substances only amplify consciousness. They don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the mind that’s amplified is different. When an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward will, in the beginning, be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history. That’s why these substances are very helpful for healing: they evoke our unconscious, and therefore they evoke our problems—an individual experience.

Iain McNay:
So is the transformation happening within the trip, or after you come back—or both?
Chris Bache:
It’s both. And I want to say this—there’s a lot of discussion about psychedelics and enlightenment: do psychedelics lead to enlightenment? Are they counterproductive or productive? These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.

> meone used a similar method, they would reach the unfolding you did? Or is that not possible to say?
Chris Bache: I think it is possible to say—Stan Grof’s work allows us to say it. He’s integrating the experiences of thousands of people; I’m integrating my own. My experiences fit within the larger matrix his work has explored. It’s a complicated answer, because on one hand I want to say yes, and on the other I must qualify it. These substances amplify consciousness; they don’t give you an experience or take you to a particular place. They amplify your mind. Because each of us has a different life story, the amplified mind is different, and when an amplified mind engages the deeper mind of the universe, what comes forward initially will be somewhat unique and reflect our individual history.

> r current perspective and the teachings we’ve received from the past—perhaps Buddhism in particular?
Chris Bache:
Once again, I want to emphasize that the work I did is a path of temporary immersion. Temporary immersion does not easily or conventionally lead to permanent shifts in awareness. You have to do a lot of spiritual practice before what we experience in an amplified psychedelic state can become our ordinary consciousness.

The great masters of the spiritual traditions, and of Buddhism in particular, have always been my heroes. Their teachings have been my guiding light for how to engage psychedelic states responsibly, and how to invest in them in ways that can be converted into long-term transformations of one’s baseline consciousness. Truly, all honor to the great beings of these traditions.

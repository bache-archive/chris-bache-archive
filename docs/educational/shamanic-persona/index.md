*A state-specific, semi-autonomous integrator of psychedelic experience that remembers beyond the ego and matures—dying and being reborn—as deeper levels of reality open.*

## Curated weave (book-first)

> In the repeated opening and closing of consciousness, a semiautonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed that retains and integrates our psychedelic experiences […] the shamanic persona.  
> — **LSDMU Appendix I §1 ¶8**

Bache coins “shamanic persona” to name a *living* identity that coheres across sessions and holds capacities our ordinary self cannot (Appendix I §1 ¶8). It is not an archetype, but the *specific* memory of a particular psychedelic history—shaped by the clarity, focus, and integration of one’s work.

> All visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states.  
> — **LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶2**

Because disclosure is participatory, the persona both reflects and conditions what can meet us. Early work functions as a training camp, polishing mind and subtle body to sustain larger energies with coherence and recall.

> LSD sessions “grind slow but grind fine,” conditioning us physically and psychologically for the long journey.  
> — **LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5**

As thresholds deepen, the persona itself must yield.

> In a sustained regimen, the shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times as new levels of reality open, each inheriting and expanding the last.  
> — **LSDMU Appendix I §1 ¶12**

Integration turns accumulated session memories into a “greater living whole,” letting the work permeate one’s life.

> By giving it a name and owning the experience, “something new has been set in motion” […] a new peace, a new transparency.  
> — **LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶5**

Practice implications follow: craft clean sessions, surrender fully, and integrate patiently—recognizing that who journeys is a hybrid identity that must repeatedly die so deeper knowing can stabilize.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU Appendix I §1 ¶8**  
> In the repeated opening and closing of consciousness in our sessions, a semiautonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed that retains and integrates all our psychedelic experiences, including those that our egoic self cannot retain. […] I call this psychedelically generated self-awareness the *shamanic persona*. […] It could also be called the *shamanic self*.

**LSDMU Appendix I §1 ¶12**  
> In a sustained psychedelic regimen, our shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times as new levels of reality continue to open. […] The second persona will retain the memories and knowledge of the first persona and add to it the new knowledge and capacities gained at this second level.

**LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶2**  
> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. […] Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states.

**LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5**  
> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness […] we have to train for the event. […] Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state.

**LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶5**  
> It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole […] surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can.

## Supporting transcript quotes (verbatim)

> …through repeatedly opening and closing awareness in psychedelic sessions, a semi-autonomous, state-specific consciousness is formed, retaining and integrating the knowledge and capacities developed. I call this the shamanic persona—a psychedelically generated, state-specific alter ego. There are many variables influencing its integrity, but generally, the better run the session, the more coherent the shamanic persona that emerges.

> When one begins to open to deeper levels of transpersonal reality, our earlier psychedelic history must yield to the new territory. […] What’s dying in these sessions, then, is sometimes the shamanic persona; its death may feel personal, but it’s not the ego—rather, a deeper individual identity birthed through previous sessions. One shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times; after the transition, the new persona retains the memories of the former and adds to them from this new, deeper level.

> …you blow yourself apart and dissolve. You’re not functioning as “Chris Bache having an experience.” You become that reality. If you do it well, you have continuity of memory in and out, but you don’t have continuity of identity. …then the second miracle happens: you come back and re-integrate your time-space identity.

> I use “kiva” as a metaphor for a good psychedelic session. You’re totally isolated from the world… Whatever you’re confronting is coming from within or through yourself, not being triggered by outside stimuli.

> The spiritual traditions say there’s no such thing as private spiritual practice. …Open your heart and mind, let the pain in, bring the healing out. We can trust that everything we do is conserved and used by other beings alive now.

## Notes & synthesis
Appendix I gives the definition and developmental rhythm; the 2015 lecture restates it plainly and adds practical determinants (session quality). “Dissolve/recongeal” clarifies why memory can persist while identity changes. “Kiva” underscores session containment; the 2024 clip widens implications without drifting off-topic.

      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.8 §1 ¶17</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oneness is a good place to stop one’s journey if one chooses to do so, for here the fragmentation of life is healed and we rest in the “true condition.” Here we learn that the essence of the individual is the essence of the Totality, that <strong>Atman is Brahman</strong>. Here we learn that all beings are empty of self-existence, that we all rise and fall together in the infinite field of the Creative Intelligence. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶6</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In deep psychedelic work, <em>one learns by becoming</em>. […] We must <em>become</em> the levels themselves. […] Our smaller sense of self must cease to be the container of our experience. It must die. Giving up everything is simply the price of inheriting everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.8 §0 ¶17</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buddhism teaches […] <em>śūnyatā</em>, “emptiness” or “transparency.” […] When one experiences emptiness, one experiences the complete absence of an independent self, not only in one’s own person but in all reality. […] I experienced emptiness and Oneness as two sides of the same coin. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.8 §1 ¶37</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our mystical traditions tell us that we are made of the stuff of God, that <strong>Atman is Brahman</strong>, and my sessions affirm this truth. […] In the firing and cooling of awareness […] eventually <em>fusing all these layers into a new form of life</em>. Our Essential Nature [is] not changed but actualized into a higher expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶101</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Cosmic Tour, I had explored the universe as a reality outside myself; in this session, I explored the universe as a dimension of my own being. […] as one moves […] into nondual causal consciousness. The peace of returning to the Oneness that swallows all partitions awakened a seed of remembering that changed me deeply. […]</p>

<p>“Part of my experience reflects a classic teaching… the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality—<strong>Atman is Brahman</strong>… my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality.”<br />

Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.",

Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.",

My sessions were so intense that eventually my system was having difficulty managing all this “extra” energy. In deep psychedelic sessions, you open yourself to enormous tidal waves of energy. They carry you into vast energetic landscapes that are fascinating to experience, but after the session ends it can leave your subtle energy system feeling stretched and achy. This short-term effect usually fades within a few days, but the longer and the more deeply you work with psychedelics, the more significant this trickle effect becomes. What do you do with all this energy that is continuously flowing into you inbetween your sessions, that pulses in your heart and beams from your skull? Now that you are no longer in the visionary state and your system has shrunk back to its “normal” shape and size, how do you integrate the new energetic being you are slowly becoming?",

There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know.

In my experience, each step deeper into our multidimensional universe is a step into a more intense field of energy. *Deeper* states of consciousness are *higher* states of energy. This is an unmistakable sensation and a widely recognized principle in spiritual traditions. One may have glancing contact with deep levels of reality without this becoming apparent, but to have *stable experience* of a given level of reality, one must acclimate to its energy. Just as when climbing a mountain we must acclimate to the atmospheric conditions of higher elevations, here we must acclimate to the energetic conditions of deeper levels of reality. In mountain climbing, we are adjusting to less oxygen; in psychedelic work, we are adjusting to more energy, and this activates intense purification processes.",

It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.",

Over time, this energetic resonance calmed down; it didn't go away entirely, but instead of being like a lightning rod, where things happened around me without my effort, I had to cooperate with it—I had to let it happen. Not that I could control it, but there was a sense that it was subtler. That teaches us something about the etheric level: the practice empowers the system, you open up, you bring in heavy-duty energy, you move from 110 volts to 240 volts—naturally, you activate these inherent circuits. But then if things calm down, it’s not like the circuits go away—the network is there, but there’s less energy driving it. There's wisdom in the pace of evolution. There is a certain—not a risk, exactly, but if you drive the system hard, things happen; then you calm down and things settle.

In that condition—like water as you keep increasing the energy going into it, or a bathtub as you keep increasing the quantity of water and the ripples start to change—we come to a tipping point, a bifurcation point, where the system has too much energy to maintain its current structures.

I stopped for two reasons. I stopped first because my physical system—my subtle energy system, my prana or qi—was running so hot after all these years of practice that it was producing certain physical symptoms that left me continually uncomfortable. I describe these in the book, but basically I understood enough about chronic energy and Ayurvedic medicine to understand what was happening, and I was just running too much energy. But that's not the major reason I stopped. The major reason I stopped was heartache. It was getting increasingly difficult to come back from the deep states of ecstatic transcendence—immersion in the divine fabric—back into my time-space reality.",

But the core truth manifesting there—without mentioning psychedelics—is that consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do in our individual field radiates 360 degrees. All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us. That’s the core teaching of The Living Classroom: there’s an atomistic quality to teaching, and a quantum quality. You and I have been having, in some ways, an atomistic conversation, but we can trust that there’s a quantum quality to it.",

Why was all that physical and energetic purification necessary?\nChris Bache\nThere are many levels of answers, but basically, if we want deeper intimacy with the consciousness of the universe, we’re moving into states that are vast and operate at a much higher frequency and energy level. Our egoic consciousness—the ordinary consciousness organized around our bodily existence—is too small. We have to let go of that consciousness. Some people find that easier or more difficult, but letting go at the egoic level and entering into spiritual reality is the first of many cycles of death and rebirth, because the universe has many levels and dimensions. To enter each successive deeper level, we have to go through a deeper surrender, and that often involves intense purification and confrontation.\n\nEvery step deeper into the universe is a step into a higher bandwidth of energy. We have to literally become a being who can live at that level—be operational at that level—for hours at a time. That takes work. It takes a lot of work.",

There will be tremendous social anxiety and personal anxiety as we basically inherit the consequences of our abuse of the Earth for all the hundreds of years that we've been creating this extractive economy. But I hope, in everybody's own individual spiritual practices, one encounters enough of the universe to experience the profound wisdom—the great intelligence—that's behind this moment of transformation, and the great compassion and love that's behind this time in our history. We are not victims. This is not an accident. It is a time that calls for us to become the heroes that we have the possibility of being—nothing less than deep, deep heroic sacrifice and actualization is called for.

First, I think integration is very important.

I didn't fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey and realized how hard the stopping hit me, exposing the imbalance—the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences, which were the deepest: being drawn into intimacy, into communion with—I want to say the divine, but I'm cautious because we have to unpack theological baggage.",

One of the things that was shown to me along the way—when you talked about fields and quantum fields—was that the intensity of the global crisis we're entering is going to hyper-stimulate not only our individual fields but the collective field of humanity. It will drive us into non-linear conditions. We know something about how physical fields behave in non-linear conditions—chaos theory. If we assume the psychic field of humanity under non-linear, far-from-equilibrium conditions will have some of those same qualities, then we have a way of seeing emergence from the depths of the human psyche: the emergence of new forms, crystallizations that weren’t available previously but actualize latent capacities within human nature. That feels deeply aligned with what you’re talking about, and it helps us understand how we can make as big a change as we need to in as short a time as we have. When we come to trigger points—bifurcations—systems are very susceptible to small perturbations, so the influence of individuals increases the more we move into a period of crisis. That gives added weight to each of our effects on the outcome. I really support what you’re saying.",

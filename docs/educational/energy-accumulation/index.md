> This educational page explores the concept of energy accumulation as articulated by Christopher M. Bache. It examines how individual and collective experiences of energy can build momentum over time, influencing personal development and broader societal awareness. The discussion highlights the interplay between intense energetic experiences and the challenges of managing accumulated energy within one's subtle energy system.

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶4**

> Second, I began to realize that my system was *accumulating and storing energy* across multiple sessions, even though these sessions were sometimes months apart. I had watched as each session began more or less where the previous session had stopped, so I knew that they were tightly interwoven thematically, but I had assumed that each session stood on its own feet energetically, that the energetic output of each session was separate and independent. Now I began to realize that there was an energetic momentum building across the sessions. My system was somehow storing energy activated in multiple sessions and then using that stored energy to generate these massive periodic breakthroughs. This was a sobering discovery as it changed my calculation of the true cost of each breakthrough. Each new initiation into a deeper level of reality was being underwritten not by hours but by months and even years of work.

**LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶11**

> This energy nourished me spiritually and helped me grow into the being I was becoming, but it also became something of a problem. My sessions were so intense that eventually my system was having difficulty managing all this “extra” energy. In deep psychedelic sessions, you open yourself to enormous tidal waves of energy. They carry you into vast energetic landscapes that are fascinating to experience, but after the session ends it can leave your subtle energy system feeling stretched and achy. This short-term effect usually fades within a few days, but the longer and the more deeply you work with psychedelics, the more significant this trickle effect becomes. What do you do with all this energy that is continuously flowing into you inbetween your sessions, that pulses in your heart and beams from your skull? Now that you are no longer in the visionary state and your system has shrunk back to its “normal” shape and size, how do you integrate the new energetic being you are slowly becoming?

**LSDMU ch.12 §1 ¶2**

> After stopping my sessions, it took about five years for my subtle energy system to calm down and find its new equilibrium. The quantity of energy flowing through my body slowly subsided, and as it did I became more comfortable living in my skin again. During this cooling off period, I began to notice that the synchronicities with my students that I described in *The Living Classroom* were happening less frequently, underscoring the role that sheer energy plays in accessing these ever-present fields of information. During the peak years, I had sometimes felt like a lightning rod, triggering insights and openings around me over which I had little control. Now I found that I had to cooperate with this process for these connections to manifest. The lightning still strikes and arrows still hit unseen targets, but today it has become a subtler dance.

**LSDMU ch.5 §5 ¶6**

> Flowing on the energy of the universe, suddenly everything was turned off and then on again. Everything that is, suddenly was not—POW —then was again. This happened repeatedly. The universe kept vanishing. The jolts were the winking out of Being into Non-Being.

**LSDMU ch.7 §1 ¶10**

> Even after this dismemberment and reconstruction, managing the intense energy of this domain continued to be a challenge. Stabilizing these energetic transitions from one platform of awareness to another takes practice and repetition.

**LSDMU ch.9 §1 ¶28**

> What I then saw was that the unified field of humanity was moving decisively and precipitously to become more aware of itself. Whereas previously it had existed as an extended fabric largely unconscious of itself, now it was waking itself up. Visually, this took the form of energy coming together in swift, contractive spasms that created bright flashes of awareness. I repeatedly saw extended webs of energy suddenly contract and explode in brilliant flashes. In the past, these flashes had been swallowed by the inertia of the collective psyche and not endured long. Now, however, the flashes were beginning to hold their own and to connect with other flashes occurring around the planet.

**LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶8**

> As I mentioned earlier, there is an energetic aspect to this cycle of initiation. In my experience, each step deeper into our multidimensional universe is a step into a more intense field of energy. *Deeper* states of consciousness are *higher* states of energy. This is an unmistakable sensation and a widely recognized principle in spiritual traditions. One may have glancing contact with deep levels of reality without this becoming apparent, but to have *stable experience* of a given level of reality, one must acclimate to its energy. Just as when climbing a mountain we must acclimate to the atmospheric conditions of higher elevations, here we must acclimate to the energetic conditions of deeper levels of reality. In mountain climbing, we are adjusting to less oxygen; in psychedelic work, we are adjusting to more energy, and this activates intense purification processes.

**LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶136**

> Rather than letting me rest in this new domain, the energy generated by embracing the collective suffering continued to build to unbelievable extremes even here. The energy formed rivers of liquid fire—white-hot lava flows and exploding sun flares. Usually these currents surrounded me in displays of extraordinary power and beauty, but several times I was drawn into them. I was immersed in suns exploding into rivers of fire shooting into space. The liquid fire poured through me, completely consuming me and transporting me. There is no experiencing these things without being changed at the core.

**LSDMU ch.5 §5 ¶12**

> We control the flow of energy out from and back into our lives. What comes to us from without originates from within. The more one moves toward one’s center and engages the deeper levels of one’s conditioning, the more one becomes conscious of being the source of one’s experience. If my energy is clear, my experience will be clear. Only by reaching one’s core can one become completely unconditioned and free.

**LSDMU ch.7 §1 ¶7**

> In place of human desire, the chanting poured a raw energy into me, channeling it directly into my bones. For seemingly endless time, they chanted power into my bones. This was the most prominent feature of the session. They were breaking me down and placing a power into my bones through vibration. Like a battery being charged, I kept drinking the energy in. I could feel changes taking place deep inside me as I absorbed more and more of this power.

**LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶6**

> I keep experiencing something like a reaching out and drawing in of this field, consolidating it, concentrating it, and stabilizing it within the
> center that “I” represent. Instead of being allowed to flow out into the myriad worlds that exist at this level, I am being concentrated and taken through some metamorphosis that is taking me into an entirely new level of reality. (Session 48)

**LSDMU ch.7 §5 ¶17**

> I experienced clearly that the individual and collective energy of everything that surrounds us creates a collective net of influences that flows through our conscious and unconscious awareness. Usually, we do not notice these subtle fields of influence, but in my current state I could clearly distinguish their distinct patterns of vibration. Together they formed the seamless tissue of Manifesting Intelligence.

**LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶54**

> In the early session, my body was being pushed to higher and higher levels of energy, making me nauseous and always on the edge of throwing up. The energy was enormous. I danced around the edges of the collective pain from previous sessions, but there was nothing new in it. I had already explored everything that was passing through me. And yet, after a while, I became caught up in it again. Things were moving very fast at this point. There was a raging pain, but it did not seem to be about me personally. I tried to understand how I might

**LSDMU ch.7 §5 ¶6**

> After some time at this level, things changed. Everything around me began to spin and become very confused. I grabbed on to some focus at the center of this cyclone and held on. I was not resisting the change, but was holding still so that the change could happen to me. It was like being in the center of a tornado, at the center of an exploding sun. The energy moving through me was enormous. The power of this archetypal meltdown was many times greater than the meltdown of the species field had been. I felt this explosive fire burning things out of me, melting me down.

**LSDMU ch.11 §2 ¶4**

> In earlier years, I had thought that these energy problems were a sign that my ego-death was incomplete. I thought that if I could just undergo a “complete ego-death” they would clear up. Eventually, however, I realized that they were being caused not from dying too little but from dying too much. With each round of death and rebirth, I was being plunged deeper into the furnace of creation. Though I could accommodate this energy well enough in the short term, my body was having increasing difficulty managing it in the long term. My system was simply running too hot. Eventually, I realized that I had to stop plunging myself into the fire of Pure Radiance, no matter how much! longed to be there. I had to let my system cool down. I had to let my physical being integrate more completely what it had already received. William Blake wrote, “You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.” My body was telling me that seventy-three high-dose sessions was more than enough.

**LSDMU ch.9 §2 ¶13**

> There was an important aspect of this sequence that focused on the actual mechanisms that lay behind this transition. The key was understanding that this global crisis will be so severe that it will impact not only individuals but also the collective unconscious of humanity itself. The suffering generated by the eco-crisis was so widespread, so deep, and so sustained that the field of the species-mind was being driven into higher and higher levels of arousal. Eventually, the species mind moved into such a highly energized state that it began to function differently. I experienced these changes in terms of the concepts of superconductivity and nonlinear systems. I have only a limited understanding of these scientific concepts, but they seemed to apply both literally and metaphorically to the workings of the collective psyche. I experienced them more deeply than I was able to fully grasp cognitively, but the intuitive taking in was exceptionally clear and well defined.

**LSDMU ch.9 §2 ¶18**

> History is intensifying. Feedback loops are accelerating. Time is becoming concentrated. Developments are unfolding exponentially. The past is rapidly catching up with us; debts put off for generations are coming due; a new beginning approaches. The ecological crisis will precipitate a death-rebirth confrontation that will shatter our psycho-spiritual isolation, both individually and societally, and bring forward an awakening of common ground within us. I saw that once we made this painful transition, we would discover that all was gain. Nothing essential had been lost. We will look with amazement at the depth of ignorance that had set us on this course of self-decimation, and we will not long for that past at all. All is gain, all is gain.

**LSDMU ch.8 §0 ¶29**

> The falling away of the concerns of my present historical personality carried with it a sense of regathering the energies of my life. It was as though I was regathering energies that had been strewn over centuries of time through many incarnations. As I did this, I became step-by-step what I had been before I had incarnated in space-time, but at the same time I also focused and clarified what had been accomplished by entering space-time. So there was both the sense of return, with a profound resonance of homecoming, and also the sense of realization of accomplishment, of seeing clearly what had been the purpose of the entire exercise.

**LSDMU ch.8 §1 ¶29**

> Session 49 also showed me a second principle at work in my classroom. It showed me that fields of consciousness emerge in groups that reflect the intention and activity of that group. The better focused the group’s intention and the longer such activity goes on, the stronger these fields will become. Doctors working with patients activate healing fields; coaches activate human performance fields. Because I was an educator, the fields that were emerging in my classroom were *learning fields*, fields that reflected the cumulative efforts of hundreds of students studying the same ideas with me semester after semester. As these learning fields grew stronger through the years, they began to accelerate and deepen the learning of students. My students were being activated not just by resonance to my individual energy but also by the contagious energy of these *course fields* that were growing stronger by year.

**LSDMU ch.5 §2 ¶10**

> The primary lesson was karma, and karma was simply the force set in motion through countless choices that come to constitute history. History at any point in time has a momentum so large that it must complete itself into tomorrow. Karma was the force of this momentum through time—the momentum of individuals, of nations. Energy started must complete itself. What we gather to us must express itself over time. (Session 15)

> e dose today, I wouldn’t be able to get back to where I was journeying in the last years of my work.
Every step into a deeper level of reality moves you into more intense energy. Over multiple sessions, there’s an accumulation of energy in your being. My system was storing energy session after session, even when months apart, building a massive momentum that would focus and lead to a breakthrough into a new level of consciousness. Those breakthroughs were paid for not simply by hours of intense work but sometimes by years of work. To get back into some of the territory I explored—the diamond luminosity—it would take years of conscientious work to rebuild that energetic momentum.

> sometimes have to reach these crux points for there to be enough energy to push us over and through.
That’s not pleasant, and as that energy builds we’ll collectively feel more uneasy in our body-biome. However, as we expand into soul awareness and into trust—the field of trust underpinning the whole process—this can begin to inform our biology. I know that both Chris and I feel deeply safe in this world, even as it moves closer to what looks like an Armageddon-type scenario. There’s an underlying benevolence and intelligence preparing us for a quantum leap. We have to sink into that trust field embedded in the eternal nature of our soul.

> energized by this disruption. It’s literally going to begin to boil underneath our individual minds.
My understanding is that in evolution there are multiple levels—at least two. We, as individual egos, are born over and over again in roughly hundred-year cycles. Underneath those cycles there’s a learning taking place, a developmental process we usually refer to as the soul. The individual incarnates, but the soul is growing, becoming more, suffusing our lives. The same thing happens collectively: every generation, billions of people are born, but there’s a learning gathering underneath them, collecting in deep, archetypal structures. That’s what’s coming to a boil—not just our individual incarnation, but that underlying structure coming into a high-energy state.

> ocused than ever in the present. That’s the thought I’d like to end on. Do you want to close us off?
Chris Bache: That’s a really good thought and a good spot to end on. The principle of accumulation is fundamental to understanding what’s happening in creation. The universe is accumulating—it’s learning. It’s a self-learning system. We are constantly learning; we can’t help but learn. Even if we do a mediocre job in a lifetime, we’re still learning. As we learn, we activate capacities. In one sense, I think we’re learning to be geniuses in every area of life: a genius at chess, a genius at relationships—genius in all the different areas. Each lifetime is a petal in a flower; the soul is the flower. I sometimes meditate on a flower and imagine each hundred-year lifetime as a pistil, a stamen, a petal in this magnificent flower. To be a genius at life—to be completely unfolded and take advantage of the opportunity we’ve been given to grow and become more than we’ve been.

Thank you, Chris, for coming and sharing with us. It was beautiful to see you express yourself so freely and articulate everything so well. My curiosity about working with fields relates to the form of the atom—the way the electron jumps from ring to ring instantly. As a model for how the universe is structured, I wonder what you would have to say about the evolution of consciousness in a relational field and quantum leaps in that field.

> s, we contribute to the developmental history and strengthening of the mind and body of our species.
In archetypal reality, the deaths I went through carried enormous energy—fire, volcanoes, solar flares—excruciating experiences of being burned alive and consumed. This is important: as you go deeper into the universe, every deeper level of reality functions at a higher level of energy. This is recognized in the deep mystical traditions. A deeper level of consciousness is a higher level of energy, and if you are going to have stable experience there, you must stabilize your consciousness at that higher energy. Mountain climbers adapt to less oxygen as they ascend; likewise, in deep non-ordinary states you must accommodate greater and greater energy, learning to manage it. Otherwise, your experiences will be fragmented and incoherent, and you won’t bring back much detail.

> re”—that kind of thing, which I listen to, remember, and try to emulate. But keep it up, keep it up.
Chris Bache:
Let me mention something about the etheric field. This comes at the very end of "The Living Classroom." The book was published in 2008, written in 2006–2007, and I stopped the heavy-duty psychedelic work in '99. Over time, this energetic resonance calmed down; it didn't go away entirely, but instead of being like a lightning rod, where things happened around me without my effort, I had to cooperate with it—I had to let it happen. Not that I could control it, but there was a sense that it was subtler. That teaches us something about the etheric level: the practice empowers the system, you open up, you bring in heavy-duty energy, you move from 110 volts to 240 volts—naturally, you activate these inherent circuits. But then if things calm down, it’s not like the circuits go away—the network is there, but there’s less energy driving it. There's wisdom in the pace of evolution. There is a certain—not a risk, exactly, but if you drive the system hard, things happen; then you calm down and things settle. So I don’t have that transparency today that I did at the peak described in "The Living Classroom." Now it’s much subtler than it was then.

> he subtle energy body. Purification is, I think, essential and endemic to working with psychedelics.
In Tibetan Vajrayana, for instance, monks must complete ngondro—the five foundational practices, including 100,000 prostrations with mantras and visualizations—to transform and clarify the subtle energy system before receiving deeper teachings. These practices build the capacity to enter very profound states of consciousness. If you enter these deeper states rapidly—as can happen with psychedelics—very powerful purification processes are triggered: physical, emotional, and mental detoxification. It’s a tremendous catharsis, described in subtle energy terms. You really have to work with the subtle energy bodies—plural, not just one—which fits well with Indian Ayurvedic and Chinese meridian systems.

> r into ourselves than ever before, accomplishing what we might never accomplish without this ordeal.
I was also shown some of the mechanism responsible for this—over and over—until I understood it. It has to do with the functioning of the collective psyche. In this time of accelerated, intensified individual suffering, it’s not just our individual psyches being activated, but all the suffering of humanity gathering at a centralized level—as a morphogenic field, as Sheldrake has helped us understand. The scenario that unfolded was that the collective psyche will move into such a highly energized state that it will begin to operate as a non-linear, far-from-equilibrium system. We know something about how physical systems operate in non-linear conditions: they are capable of accelerated change; small perturbations produce expanded outcomes; creativity emerges from within the system in unprecedented ways; hydrogen and oxygen combine to produce water. Things happen that are unanticipated within a linear framework.

> tudents were being touched in deep, private areas—places needing healing or where they were blocked.
As I faced my blocks and entered deep communion with the intelligence of life, it was as if the intelligent fabric around me was being activated, triggering aha moments and confrontations with their blocks. Students knew something unusual was happening. I couldn’t exactly explain it, but we all knew. Some took my courses partly for the intellectual content and partly to be in the energy of the room.

It wasn’t just resonance between my energy and theirs; there was a second phenomenon I discuss in The Living Classroom: group fields. Think of Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic fields, but smaller and more specific. I found psychic fields growing around my courses, getting stronger year by year. Hundreds of students learning over many years created a field that impacted, accelerated, and deepened the learning of subsequent students. Multiple factors were at play.

> d, you have to examine the structure of the whole trajectory, like assembling a giant jigsaw puzzle.
Aviv Shahar:
You describe the foundation of teaching that finds you in Session 16, which you call “self-generating fields of experience.” You write, “We are self-generating fields of energy in a living universe. We generate energy by making choices, and the universe responds to this energy.” That’s what you were describing with the lake. “We are always creating our own experience,” and, “We control the flow of energy out from and back into our lives. What comes to us from without originates from within. The more one moves toward one’s center and engages the deeper levels of one’s conditioning, the more one becomes conscious of being the source of one’s experience.” I suppose that insight continues to evolve with you. It’s a powerful synthesis of the human journey whether you do psychedelics or not, because it’s true in day-to-day consciousness. You don’t need an altered state to realize you’re the catalyst of what the universe brings to you.

Chris Bache:
That might be a good place to wrap up some of the discussion, because it's relevant to where we might go. I stopped for two reasons. I stopped first because my physical system—my subtle energy system, my prana or qi—was running so hot after all these years of practice that it was producing certain physical symptoms that left me continually uncomfortable. I describe these in the book, but basically I understood enough about chronic energy and Ayurvedic medicine to understand what was happening, and I was just running too much energy. But that's not the major reason I stopped. The major reason I stopped was heartache. It was getting increasingly difficult to come back from the deep states of ecstatic transcendence—immersion in the divine fabric—back into my time-space reality.

> 50 sessions in than in the first few. Third, the quality of the massive amounts of energy involved.
Working in serial sessions—on average about five a year—I built energetic momentum. I worked four years, stopped six, then worked ten more, averaging five a year. Systematic work takes your body and mind into those states repeatedly; like an athlete in training, you build energy that carries you to new performance levels. The universe carries you into deeper levels of consciousness. Because the sessions were so intense and demanding psychologically and physically, I prepared for days beforehand—physically, with yoga and chiropractic, making sure my body was carefully aligned; and dietarily and spiritually, with certain practices before a session and others for integration afterward. It’s extremely intense work.

Jef Baker:
You used the term “breadth” as well as depth—like bandwidth—which I hadn’t heard put that way.

> for their well-being. Not presuming I know what’s right for them, just praying for their well-being.
The more we activate these latent group potentials, the more we accelerate learning. I found there’s not only a collective field in the room, but a class field, and deeper still a course field—a learning and empowerment that builds over years. The individual mind is situated within a class mind, situated within a course mind. Once you see it, you begin to recognize it everywhere. If there is a hyperobject, it’s simply the connective tissue of mind. We are always inherently connected; we can become conscious of that and responsible to it in whatever we’re doing.

Andrew Holecek:
And again, it’s back to making unconscious processes conscious. If you can do that, you increase levels of communication and evocation, and heighten what’s already there. So why not engage it, bring it into awareness, pay allegiance to it, surrender to it—and therefore enhance and accelerate it.

> ferent phenomena, different bandwidth, so to speak. And you must acclimate to that level of reality.
Every step deeper into the universe is a step into a higher level of energy. To stabilize consciousness at a particular level, you must acclimate to the energy—and that’s some of the very intense cleansing that continues to take place 30, 40, 50 sessions in. You’re learning how to stabilize consciousness at extremely high levels of energy. That just takes a long time.

> ant for every individual to reach as deeply and as high as possible and manifest the noblest intent.
If the future were moving the same way as the past—if we used a linear understanding of history—we might say the forces arrayed against us are overwhelming, that the individual can't do anything, that we'll be swallowed by environmental processes. But that's not what I saw. As suffering increases, the entire psychic field of humanity—the collective unconscious—will be increasingly pressurized, shoved into what physicists call nonlinear or far-from-equilibrium conditions. In far-from-equilibrium conditions, individual perturbations produce large outcomes. Which means that as we enter deeper into our crisis of history, individuals can have a larger and larger impact on the outcome—on how this crisis will manifest. I think it's a time of individual empowerment to facilitate deep, cultural, profound social transformation.

Duane Elgin
Indeed, we're moving into a time of intense compression. This is going to be a heated journey—humanity passing through the fire of initiation that we’re already beginning to experience as we look beyond nation-state boundaries to the Earth as a whole system. What we’re doing now will not carry us to the end of this century. We’re going to be pushed outside our usual circumstances and into new conditions—not simply as nations, but as a species. That will be the catalyst for a rapid acceleration of evolutionary potentials already surfacing. This gathering is one expression of that, as is the role of psychedelics in catalyzing an awakening to a new understanding of ourselves and the human journey. Here we go as a species—into the fire, into initiation, and, hopefully, into our higher humanity.

What happened for me, completely against my will and without my guidance, was that I started filling in blanks in my lectures—opportunities to explain a principle with examples that just came out of my imagination. Students began coming up afterward and saying, “This is exactly what happened to me this week,” or, “This is exactly what happened to my mother.” At first I thought, okay, chance. But it kept happening so often. Over time, as my spiritual practice deepened—which happened to be a psychedelic practice, though that’s irrelevant; it’s really about spiritual practice—my access to my students’ minds deepened. It began to narrow in on places where they were hurt or wounded or blocked from moving to the next stage of their life. Working together, or simply being in the classroom with me while I opened to very intense, very large, very pure states of awareness, it began to cascade around me.

You’ve also spoken about speed. We see it in natural systems—like water boiling. Nothing seems to happen, then a few bubbles, then, at boiling point, it erupts into steam. Simple metaphor, but true throughout nature. Humanity is reaching that period. Scientists point to similar thresholds. The ocean, for example, has been capturing huge amounts of CO2—sinking it to the deep—but it’s slowly building up. At some point the ocean can no longer capture more; its ability weakens, and the CO2 we create suddenly explodes into the atmosphere. It looks like we’ve been in a hiatus, and we have, because there’s an illusion we’ve been okay—until everything speeds up much more quickly than most could conceive. Some scientists see it—especially those who work across multiple fields, systems theorists who understand interconnectivity. And mystics like us. Many are predicting very quick change that can be destabilizing for the planet.

      <p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶11 (10 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This energy nourished me spiritually and helped me grow into the being I was becoming, but it also became something of a problem. My sessions were so intense that eventually my system was having difficulty managing all this “extra” energy. In deep psychedelic sessions, you open yourself to enormous tidal waves of energy. They carry you into vast energetic landscapes that are fascinating to experience, but after the session ends it can leave your subtle energy system feeling stretched and achy. This short-term effect usually fades within a few days, but the longer and the more deeply you work with psychedelics, the more significant this trickle effect becomes. What do you do with all this energy that is continuously flowing into you inbetween your sessions, that pulses in your heart and beams from your skull? Now that you are no longer in the visionary state and your system has shrunk back to its “normal” shape and size, how do you integrate the new energetic being you are slowly becoming?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶7 (1 · 8)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶8 (1 · 12)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there is an energetic aspect to this cycle of initiation. In my experience, each step deeper into our multidimensional universe is a step into a more intense field of energy. <em>Deeper</em> states of consciousness are <em>higher</em> states of energy. This is an unmistakable sensation and a widely recognized principle in spiritual traditions. One may have glancing contact with deep levels of reality without this becoming apparent, but to have <em>stable experience</em> of a given level of reality, one must acclimate to its energy. Just as when climbing a mountain we must acclimate to the atmospheric conditions of higher elevations, here we must acclimate to the energetic conditions of deeper levels of reality. In mountain climbing, we are adjusting to less oxygen; in psychedelic work, we are adjusting to more energy, and this activates intense purification processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §5 ¶11 (5 · 5)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of the teaching was this: We are self-generating fields of energy in a living universe. We generate energy by making choices, and the universe responds to this energy. Thus, in complex and subtle ways, we are always creating our own experience. I saw this feedback working on several levels simultaneously. Some cycles took minutes, some years, some lifetimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §5 ¶2 (1 · 5)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The choice to work with high doses turned out to have enormous consequences for what unfolded on this journey. It radically expanded not only the <em>depth of consciousness</em> reached but also the <em>breadth of consciousness</em> being activated in each session. It wasn’t simply a matter of eating the same karmic meal in fewer bites, as I had naively thought. Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web. Working at these levels changed not only how deep my experiences went but also who or what was actually having these experiences, what the “working unit” of experience was in a session. In these highly energized conditions, the size of the patient literally expands. What I mean by this will become clearer as we proceed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶5 (6 · 1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §2 ¶4 (10 · 2)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, I began to realize that my system was <em>accumulating and storing energy</em> across multiple sessions, even though these sessions were sometimes months apart. I had watched as each session began more or less where the previous session had stopped, so I knew that they were tightly interwoven thematically, but I had assumed that each session stood on its own feet energetically, that the energetic output of each session was separate and independent. Now I began to realize that there was an energetic momentum building across the sessions. My system was somehow storing energy activated in multiple sessions and then using that stored energy to generate these massive periodic breakthroughs. This was a sobering discovery as it changed my calculation of the true cost of each breakthrough. Each new initiation into a deeper level of reality was being underwritten not by hours but by months and even years of work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §0 ¶36 (8 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that matter follows mind implies the ability to control one’s physical experience through the power of consciousness. This cannot be done at the level of the ego but requires the coherent integration of all the lives one has lived. Beginning to access these former lives first brings forward their unresolved fragments, causing their unfinished karma to manifest in our life. Eventually, however, these fragments are healed and the threads are rewound. As this happens, we become more internally coherent, and our physical existence begins to become more transparent to choices originating in our Soul and the deeper fields that our Soul is part of. To begin to be able to consciously direct our experience inside space-time instead of being unconsciously dragged around by our past represented a major accomplishment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶20 (1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This insight invites us to think about the dynamics of death and rebirth more multidimensionally. It is an insight that generalizes across multiple levels of reality. At the subtle level of consciousness, for example, death and rebirth may open a portal that serves not only to drain destructive energies out of the species-mind but also to infuse healing energies into the species-mind from a higher source, as the sessions reported in chapter 8 demonstrate. At still deeper levels, such portals may allow any number of transcendental blessings to be infused directly into lower orders of existence. The question then becomes: How does the addition of this principle of <em>infusion from above</em> influence the question of how we might understand what is dying and being reborn at these deep levels of psychedelic experience?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶13 (2 · 2)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the negative perinatal experiences continued to build over the next several sessions, so did the positive experiences that emerged during the ecstatic portion of the sessions. In one session, I experienced life as a living fabric of interwoven intelligences—atomic, molecular, cellular, human, societal, and planetary. This early taste of the weave of Oneness was just a metaphysical appetizer for the deeper experiences of Oneness that would follow later, so I will not spend time on it. I would, however, like to share one experience from this period because it speaks to the rationale for this book as a whole. This session helped me let go of my conventional academic training and embrace psychedelics as anew method of philosophical inquiry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶22 (1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a <em>cosmic communion</em> to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶2 (1 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path that has been well documented by scholars. From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.</p>

<p>re”—that kind of thing, which I listen to, remember, and try to emulate. But keep it up, keep it up.
Chris Bache:
Let me mention something about the etheric field. This comes at the very end of "The Living Classroom." The book was published in 2008, written in 2006–2007, and I stopped the heavy-duty psychedelic work in '99. Over time, this energetic resonance calmed down; it didn't go away entirely, but instead of being like a lightning rod, where things happened around me without my effort, I had to cooperate with it—I had to let it happen. Not that I could control it, but there was a sense that it was subtler. That teaches us something about the etheric level: the practice empowers the system, you open up, you bring in heavy-duty energy, you move from 110 volts to 240 volts—naturally, you activate these inherent circuits. But then if things calm down, it’s not like the circuits go away—the network is there, but there’s less energy driving it. There's wisdom in the pace of evolution. There is a certain—not a risk, exactly, but if you drive the system hard, things happen; then you calm down and things settle. So I don’t have that transparency today that I did at the peak described in "The Living Classroom." Now it’s much subtler than it was then.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ocused than ever in the present. That’s the thought I’d like to end on. Do you want to close us off?
Chris Bache: That’s a really good thought and a good spot to end on. The principle of accumulation is fundamental to understanding what’s happening in creation. The universe is accumulating—it’s learning. It’s a self-learning system. We are constantly learning; we can’t help but learn. Even if we do a mediocre job in a lifetime, we’re still learning. As we learn, we activate capacities. In one sense, I think we’re learning to be geniuses in every area of life: a genius at chess, a genius at relationships—genius in all the different areas. Each lifetime is a petal in a flower; the soul is the flower. I sometimes meditate on a flower and imagine each hundred-year lifetime as a pistil, a stamen, a petal in this magnificent flower. To be a genius at life—to be completely unfolded and take advantage of the opportunity we’ve been given to grow and become more than we’ve been.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in the sense of being aligned with the core of your soul and its destiny. That’s a safe place to be.
Chris Bache: That place of alignment. The way the speeding-up process worked itself out in my sessions had to do with understanding the field dynamics of consciousness. I have just enough understanding of chaos theory and non-equilibrium systems to grasp that when a system has more and more energy poured into it, it reaches a state far from equilibrium. In that condition—like water as you keep increasing the energy going into it, or a bathtub as you keep increasing the quantity of water and the ripples start to change—we come to a tipping point, a bifurcation point, where the system has too much energy to maintain its current structures. It flips into a different organizational pattern. It chooses a different future. When physical systems reach non-equilibrium points, they can do extraordinary things: produce new particles, create orders of coherence within themselves that would have been impossible at a lower energy state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nite vessel, which has to be able to accommodate that energy. That was quite a big thing, wasn't it?
Chris Bache:
Huge. Every step deeper is more intense. When you go into these states, you open into vast fields of consciousness, and the energy is just immense—it runs through your system. You have to prepare your body to go into those states, and after the session, you have to help it absorb the experience in a healthy manner. You have to stay clean—in your habits, in your meditation, your yoga, structural aspects of your body. I discovered that my system had a natural capacity to let go, and I never had trouble coming back—there was a natural congealing. But you have to monitor your system carefully. I would have a session, write it up, then take two or three months to absorb it, ponder it, follow its teachings—because it gives you teachings. Then I would open up again, and the process would repeat itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iain McNay:
There are also layers of conditioning you're letting go of—not by effort, but by allowance in the sessions, yes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>have to acclimate to that energy—go through the transformational process to stabilize at that level.
After every major breakthrough to a new level of consciousness, the next session was always very difficult and turgid. Once I broke into a new level of purity, I had to clean out all components of my being that were lower than that level so I could return to it with clear, sustained focus. It’s an energetic process as well as a cognitive one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lauren Taus:
For sure. From a psychospiritual perspective, you’re working with the body’s energy and transpersonal, collective energy. What’s the story you’re telling with your book?</p>
<p>Chris Bache:
Just what happened. Among all the psychedelics on the table today and all the experiences people are cultivating, this is one person’s experience with one psychedelic used in a very specific manner. It’s extreme in certain ways. I drilled an unusually deep borehole into the universe, but I didn’t explore a lot of the levels I moved through—I just went very deep and very far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ants now? Or did your experiences end with those 73 sessions, if that’s not too personal a question?
Chris Bache:
Not at all. I still use medicines from time to time, though much less than I used to. It’s somewhat a young person’s game. I’m 70 now—if I haven’t learned by now… After I stopped the LSD work in ’99, I occasionally did light sessions, or psilocybin sessions, and a few ayahuasca sessions, or salvia divinorum. I broadened my experience with those substances. But the LSD work was in a category unto itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing I found was that my body, my system, was storing energy over time. Doing multiple sessions, my system stored energy and used it periodically to trigger breakthroughs into new levels of consciousness. Even if I took a massive dose of LSD today, I wouldn’t get back to where I was working regularly when I finished in ’99. It would take years to develop the power to access those deeper dimensions. Over time I understood that every step into a deeper level of consciousness is a step into a higher energetic state.</p>
<p>Jef Baker:
That line really stood out.</p>
<p>Chris Bache:
It takes a long time to develop the power to access these highly energized states of consciousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to cover that? If not, is there anything else you feel we could usefully cover in the time we have?
Chris Bache:
That might be a good place to wrap up some of the discussion, because it's relevant to where we might go. I stopped for two reasons. I stopped first because my physical system—my subtle energy system, my prana or qi—was running so hot after all these years of practice that it was producing certain physical symptoms that left me continually uncomfortable. I describe these in the book, but basically I understood enough about chronic energy and Ayurvedic medicine to understand what was happening, and I was just running too much energy. But that's not the major reason I stopped. The major reason I stopped was heartache. It was getting increasingly difficult to come back from the deep states of ecstatic transcendence—immersion in the divine fabric—back into my time-space reality.</p>

<p>Chris is intuitively, subconsciously articulating what students need without knowing he’s doing it.
Chris Bache:
It's one of the reasons I'm so comfortable with what you're saying, Dan—it's so coherent with my experience in the classroom and a growing understanding of the porosity of mind. There’s the field nature of our individual consciousness and the field nature of the collective consciousness. When individuals come together and focus their intention, they create a field, and classes develop fields over decades that get stronger and stronger. The more morphic genetic fields—the more students study this material around a particular teacher—the stronger the field gets.</p>

To give it context—you did seventy-three trips over twenty years. I would never say “trips”—what word do you use?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Bache:
Sessions. Seventy-three sessions over twenty years. Each session, no matter the gap, was sequential. At the end of one session, the next session would often start where the previous one left off.</p>
<p>Iain McNay:
Approximately so—you might need several layers down to see the overarching story.</p>
<p>Chris Bache:
Yes, it's like keeping a dream journal. There is a logical flow you can identify, but sometimes you must go several layers deep before the logic becomes clear.</p>
<p>Iain McNay:
And you took the time in between to integrate and absorb what had happened. Also, you mentioned last night that your body had to adapt—the energy during the session is so powerful. You've got the absolute coming into a finite vessel, which has to be able to accommodate that energy. That was quite a big thing, wasn't it?</p>

<p>the healing out. We can trust that everything we do is conserved and used by other beings alive now.
In my academic life, I had to keep this work hidden, but I found my students were activated by it. A transparency opened between their minds and mine, demonstrating that consciousness is ultimately one. It forced me to learn a new way of teaching, respectful of the quantum fields emerging in our work together. There is no private practice—we’re arm in arm. Everything we do serves everyone.</p>

<p>Marc Caron:
Next question: Could you expand on the relationship between the individual and the collective? Do you think the right inspiration from the right individual will spread much faster into the collective consciousness than in the past?</p>
<p>Chris Bache:
If we look around, America’s in a presidential election with a deeply divided country and polar-opposite candidates. The times are turbulent and uncertain. It isn’t only truth that catalyzes truth—lying catalyzes lying; darkness catalyzes darkness. The individual–collective dynamic applies to both sides of the street. In shamanic cultures, practitioners manage dark forces as well as healing.</p>

<p>that same potential to create fields everywhere we look? Is a galaxy a kind of field? Any thoughts?
Chris Bache:
The nice thing is, whatever is going on, it’s been happening for billions of years before we even began to understand what was going on. The fact that we're starting to understand these dynamics, and maybe participate more consciously—some of my colleagues worry it undermines individuality, all this ego-fear stuff. But really, we’re just beginning to play with something that's been playing with us for a long time. I don’t know how it all works; I don’t know the full ramifications. But when we work together, synchronize ourselves with guided intention, do these exercises—what do you know? There’s a little bit of bleed-through, a little reinforcement that happens.</p>

<p>of the evolution and ecology of consciousness—where we might focus our intentions on a path forward.
Chris Bache:
About halfway through my journey, in the 38th session, in a year of great blessings—just enormous blessings—I was taken into an experience preceded by very intense purification processes, a very intense death-rebirth process. At one phase, I had the experience of all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before and was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives. I’d already written the book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But I began to experience my former lives coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They seemed to hit a critical mass, and when they did, they fused. There was an explosion of energy and all these separate lives fused into one life. There was an explosion of diamond light out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. I was then given a whole lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening. It changed my whole understanding of how reincarnation works and where it’s taking us.</p>

About halfway through my journey, in the 38th session, in a year of enormous blessings, I was taken on an experience preceded by very intense purification—very intense death-rebirth processes. At one phase in this journey, I experienced all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before. I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives, and I’d already written a book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But this was different: my former lives began coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They hit a critical mass and fused. There was an explosion of energy, and all these separate lives fused into one life. A burst of diamond light came out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time.

<p>:
As we really wrap up, any final thoughts or questions you felt should have been directed your way?
Chris Bache:
You mentioned The Living Classroom at the beginning, and it’s too late to go into it at length. But the core truth manifesting there—without mentioning psychedelics—is that consciousness is unified from the start. Everything we do in our individual field radiates 360 degrees. All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us. That’s the core teaching of The Living Classroom: there’s an atomistic quality to teaching, and a quantum quality. You and I have been having, in some ways, an atomistic conversation, but we can trust that there’s a quantum quality to it.</p>

<p>nto me very quickly, like wrapping a filament of white light around a kite spool. And at some point,
Chris Bache
All these lives fused, and there was a huge energy generated that catapulted me into a state of consciousness beyond any I had experienced up to that time. I was still an individual, but in a way that exceeded any frame of reference I’d previously imagined. When this happened, there was an explosion of diamond light from my chest, and I was given a series of teachings about where reincarnation is taking humanity. We’re not simply growing incrementally—lifetime by lifetime, century by century—making small improvements and actualizing our innate potential bit by bit. Eventually, we come to a point where all of our former lives merge and we experience our soul.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rough. Why was that, in retrospect? Why was all that physical and energetic purification necessary?
Chris Bache
There are many levels of answers, but basically, if we want deeper intimacy with the consciousness of the universe, we’re moving into states that are vast and operate at a much higher frequency and energy level. Our egoic consciousness—the ordinary consciousness organized around our bodily existence—is too small. We have to let go of that consciousness. Some people find that easier or more difficult, but letting go at the egoic level and entering into spiritual reality is the first of many cycles of death and rebirth, because the universe has many levels and dimensions. To enter each successive deeper level, we have to go through a deeper surrender, and that often involves intense purification and confrontation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every step deeper into the universe is a step into a higher bandwidth of energy. We have to literally become a being who can live at that level—be operational at that level—for hours at a time. That takes work. It takes a lot of work.</p>

<p>t’s been 24 years since you stopped. Do you feel you have fully integrated all of those experiences?
Chris Bache:
No, I haven’t. When I finished my sessions and was beginning the digesting process, in meditation the universe said to me, “Twenty years in, twenty years out.” I thought, “Oh, it’ll take me 20 years to assimilate 20 years of my journey.” As I was getting to the end, writing Diamonds from Heaven, I thought that was probably optimistic. I think it will take me many lifetimes to fully integrate all the gifts I’ve been given.</p>

<p>Sandy Sedgbeer:
What do you think, in light of what you’ve told us—what you’ve learned and seen—we most urgently need to address now as a species?</p>
<p>Chris Bache:
There are many layers to that question. First, we start by taking full responsibility for our shadow—engaging it and clearing obstacles and blocks that impede our compassion and healthy, whole psycho-spiritual functioning. We need to reconnect with, and rediscover, our relationship with the universe and our fundamental core identity with the universe.</p>

<p>speaking on so many topics. I wonder if there's anything else that you'd like to say or talk about.
Chris Bache:
We are coming into a hard time in history. We're coming into a time when, decade by decade, things are going to be getting worse and worse. There will be tremendous social anxiety and personal anxiety as we basically inherit the consequences of our abuse of the Earth for all the hundreds of years that we've been creating this extractive economy. But I hope, in everybody's own individual spiritual practices, one encounters enough of the universe to experience the profound wisdom—the great intelligence—that's behind this moment of transformation, and the great compassion and love that's behind this time in our history. We are not victims. This is not an accident. It is a time that calls for us to become the heroes that we have the possibility of being—nothing less than deep, deep heroic sacrifice and actualization is called for. But the universe will support us. Every time we make a change to live to the larger good, the universe will support us. It will help us overcome our shortcomings. This is the game of life. This is the great time of our life. In the end, we don't want to live a comfortable life so much as we want to live a life that's meaningful, and this is going to give us all an opportunity to live very meaningful lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you unpick a bit of the structure you see as useful for helping us move toward being future humans?
Chris Bache
There are several things rolled into your observations—all good. First, I think integration is very important. We have the chemical technology to trigger very deep states of consciousness, but these states may have very little lasting impact on our deeply ingrained psychological and cultural habits if we don't take time to sit with them and integrate them as deeply as we can into our embodied existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the course of my work, even though I was paying a lot of attention and doing as good a job as I could to integrate each individual session, I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey. I didn't fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey and realized how hard the stopping hit me, exposing the imbalance—the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences, which were the deepest: being drawn into intimacy, into communion with—I want to say the divine, but I'm cautious because we have to unpack theological baggage.</p>

<p>eping those grandchildren around to do their thing. We’re part of trying to make that happen. Chris?
Chris Bache: Dan, I would underscore everything you just said and put my initials beside it, because I believe it. One of the things that was shown to me along the way—when you talked about fields and quantum fields—was that the intensity of the global crisis we're entering is going to hyper-stimulate not only our individual fields but the collective field of humanity. It will drive us into non-linear conditions. We know something about how physical fields behave in non-linear conditions—chaos theory. If we assume the psychic field of humanity under non-linear, far-from-equilibrium conditions will have some of those same qualities, then we have a way of seeing emergence from the depths of the human psyche: the emergence of new forms, crystallizations that weren’t available previously but actualize latent capacities within human nature. That feels deeply aligned with what you’re talking about, and it helps us understand how we can make as big a change as we need to in as short a time as we have. When we come to trigger points—bifurcations—systems are very susceptible to small perturbations, so the influence of individuals increases the more we move into a period of crisis. That gives added weight to each of our effects on the outcome. I really support what you’re saying.</p>

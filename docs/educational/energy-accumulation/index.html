      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §2 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, I began to realize that my system was <em>accumulating and storing energy</em> across multiple sessions, even though these sessions were sometimes months apart. […] My system was somehow storing energy activated in multiple sessions and then using that stored energy to generate these massive periodic breakthroughs. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶8</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there is an energetic aspect to this cycle of initiation. […] <em>Deeper</em> states of consciousness are <em>higher</em> states of energy. […] to have <em>stable experience</em> of a given level of reality, one must acclimate to its energy. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. […] They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring […] <em>An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine.</em> […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶11</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This energy nourished me spiritually […] but it also became something of a problem. […] after the session ends it can leave your subtle energy system feeling stretched and achy. […] What do you do with all this energy that is continuously flowing into you in between your sessions […]?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.5 §5 ¶11</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of the teaching was this: We are self-generating fields of energy in a living universe. We generate energy by making choices, and the universe responds to this energy. […] Some cycles took minutes, some years, some lifetimes.</p>

<p>One thing I found was that my body, my system, was <strong>storing energy over time</strong>… used it periodically to <strong>trigger breakthroughs</strong> into new levels of consciousness. […] It would take <strong>years</strong> to develop the power to access those deeper dimensions.<br />

<p>You have to <strong>prepare your body</strong> to go into those states… then take <strong>two or three months</strong> to absorb it… then I would open up again, and the process would repeat itself.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yewNM9smrqo?t=1105">00:18:25</a>  — <em>Diamonds from Heaven – Interview with Iain McNay</em> (2018-07-05) • 00:18:25</p>
<p>Every step deeper into the universe is a step into a <strong>higher bandwidth of energy</strong>… We have to literally <strong>become a being who can live at that level</strong>… That takes a lot of work.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/mG1uyBw0ucg?t=460">00:07:40</a>  — <em>Diamonds from Heaven: Exploring the Mind of the Universe</em> (2023-07-12) • 00:07:40</p>
<p>When a system has <strong>more and more energy</strong> poured into it… it reaches a <strong>bifurcation point</strong>… flips into a different organizational pattern.<br />

<p>Over time, this energetic resonance <strong>calmed down</strong>… The practice empowers the system… you move from <strong>110 volts to 240 volts</strong>—you activate circuits. If things calm down, the circuits remain but with <strong>less energy</strong> driving it.<br />

<p>I stopped first because my subtle energy system was <strong>running so hot</strong>… I was just <strong>running too much energy</strong>.<br />

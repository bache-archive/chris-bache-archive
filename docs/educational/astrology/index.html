<blockquote>
<p>Christopher M. Bache is a prominent figure in the exploration of consciousness, particularly in relation to psychedelics and astrology. His work investigates the interplay between individual experiences and cosmic rhythms, proposing that astrological factors may influence psychological states and transformative experiences. Bache's research contributes to a broader understanding of how spiritual and psychological dimensions intersect with the natural world.</p>

<p>There may be another factor that influences what emerges in our sessions. Because our solar system is constantly moving, the variable of planetary setting changes in subtle ways from day to day and month to month. In a collaboration of many years, Stan Grof and Richard Tarnas have proposed the bold hypothesis that people’s experiences in deep nonordinary states move in synchrony with the rhythms of our solar system. Using case histories, Grof has argued that natal and transit astrology can illumine and even predict the tenor of one’s psychedelic session on any given day. This is too large a topic for me to take up here, but in the interest of encouraging this discussion, I will give my birth information and the dates of all my sessions in appendix II at the end of the book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the world that Newton is describing, life is a long spiral of learning. Each lifetime on Earth is balanced in the interlife with periods of rest and replenishing. When the time is right, the Soul begins the process of choosing its next incarnation, and this brings me to my reason for introducing Newton’s work here. Newton’s clients report that choosing an incarnation is something that is done with great care. Acting with the assistance of our spiritual mentors and in concert with the Souls with whom we will share this incarnation, we consciously choose our next life on Earth. For this to be an informed choice, we must be able to see what these future lives will consist of, and this future-seeing takes place at what Newton calls the Ring of Destiny.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether I would have made it completely off the mountain were it not for Christina’s love. A journeyer herself, she understood the challenge I was facing. She held me in the years of sadness, believed in me when I doubted myself, and soothed me when wholeness seemed so far away. I owe her more than I can repay. A lover of the Earth and daughter of the stars, she never tires of mapping the variety the Infinite pours into each of our lives, uncovering the potent destinies hidden in our astrological charts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The choices we make at the Ring of Destiny will become our earthly destiny—not a fixed destiny with a predetermined outcome but a destiny of structured possibilities. In choosing a life, we are choosing a life script, a set of circumstances and conditions that are defined but open-ended. Once we have made our choice, the knowledge we have acquired about our next incarnation is taken away from us through the imposition of a deliberate amnesia, because too much foreknowledge would undermine the learning exercise. What we retain is a felt sense of direction and purpose, an inner instinct that tells us when we are on or off course in our lives. In addition, markers are planted in our unconscious to help us recognize significant people and events when we encounter them on Earth. The bottom line is this: when we knew more than we know now, when future probabilities were clearer to us than they are now, we chose the life we are currently living.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a series of visions, I saw that the conflicts my wife and I had been having were rooted in a difference in our “soul age.” Soul age is simply a metaphor for spiritual development rooted in a reincar-national worldview. “Older souls” are seen as being more spiritually developed than “younger souls,” presumably from having lived more lifetimes on Earth. In my sessions, I saw that Carol was spiritually older than I was, with a heightened spiritual sensitivity and more developed capacity for contemplative practice. I saw myself as being younger, as coming more recently from lifetimes of middle age and only now moving into early wisdom. Carol already knew of things that I was just learning about.</p>

<p>Our intertwined destinies were part of a larger unfolding, and there was power in this unfolding. On a personal level, the message was, “Follow the natural slope of your life. Struggle is not necessary.” The circumstances of my life were being shaped by processes deeper than my conscious ego could track. My well-being lay in trusting these circumstances and responding to them as deeply as I could.</p>

<p>My notes from these sessions are filled with references to a “deeper intentionality,” to “causal forces arching through time” and “the given of our lives.” My understanding of life was being expanded and deepened. I was being given a new mythos for how life works. As a professor of religious studies, I recognized that this new mythos was actually an old mythos, though not one I knew much about at the time. It was the mythos of reincarnation and the soul. In the years that followed, the theme of reincarnation wove itself in and out of my sessions many times, both as a general principle and as personal memories of some of my former lives. Because of its recurring presence in my sessions, let me step to the side for a moment and say something about reincarnation here.</p>

<p>I experienced myself as being me, surrounded by the people and activities of my familiar world, and yet I had become completely hollow, emptied of all personal content, and in the end transparent to a fluid, golden Intelligence that permeated all reality and was flowing through me into whoever or whatever was in front of me. The image that stood out in my mind to frame this was the Sun-Neptune square in my natal chart. It was as if my individuality (Sun) had yielded completely to the Divine (Neptune) and had become transparent to its vast energies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that Sri Aurobindo was correct when he said that these cosmologies reflect an incomplete understanding of existence. They reflect the deepening of humanity’s contact with the spiritual universe that took place about three to four thousand years ago. Once we began to gain <em>experiential</em> access to the bliss of this mother universe through meditation, yoga, and psychedelic substances, how could we not but conclude that we “belonged” there more than here, that Earth was not our “true home,” and that we had “fallen” from paradise through some kind of cosmic blunder? Our enthusiasm for these theologies of return is understandable given their historical context, but in the context of the dramatically expanded understanding of the universe emerging in science combined with our deepening psychedelic experience, we are beginning to see that these theologies reflect an incomplete model of the cosmos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶41</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we begin to grasp the true scale of nature’s intent, we must revise many of our previous assumptions about reincarnation. In the classic up-and-out model of rebirth, for example, it is often said that it is a “law” of reincarnation that we are not allowed to remember our former lives when we are born. This amnesia is essential because if we were able to remember our former lives, it would overwhelm our earthly identity. Our present life would become unmanageable if we remembered everything we had ever been and done in our previous lifetimes. Numerous Hollywood movies have played with this theme. But this way of thinking is too small and fails to grasp the fact that reincarnation is an <em>evolutionary driver</em> whose effects accumulate not only in spiritual reality but inside space-time as well.</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶21</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book <em>The Cosmic Game</em>. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.</p>

<p>While these kinds of responses might be expected in certain types of courses, such as a counseling course, this was not the case for the kinds of courses I was teaching, which were Introduction to World Religions, Religion and the Earth, Psychology of Religion, Transpersonal Studies, and Buddhism. It was not the content of the course that seemed to be driving these effects but something deeper. What was triggering these effects was not what I was doing but what I had become through my psychedelic practice. Because of this work, my core energy was changing. A field of energy moving through me or around me was growing stronger, causing a spontaneous <em>energetic resonance</em> to spring up between me and my students underneath the exchange of ideas in the classroom.</p>

<p>se I was working in a collective context and could see these ripples coming back at me all the time.
On the issue of astrology and individual and global transits, this is a complicated question, and I'm not an astrologer, so I want to be careful. I tracked my sessions. I used astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from Rick Tarnas about correlations between outer planets and inner experience in psychedelic states. I planned my sessions by transits, and I tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs against the planets. I found a very complicated correlation. While there were correlations between my individual transits and global transits with the unfolding of my psychedelic experience, there were also differences I wasn't expecting—a failure to find correspondence. For example, my breakthroughs were not always paired with Uranus. My really intense, up-against-the-wall, death-in-your-face experiences were not marked by Saturn transits or Saturn global transits, or even Pluto transits.</p>

That said, I have not found the correlations to be as striking as I expected. As my work deepened over the years, I couldn't correlate breakthroughs and impasses with astrological variables as much as I had anticipated. That led me to formulate what I call the roll off hypothesis: in the early stages of our work, or at lower doses—when our time-space identity is being unfolded and impacted—I think there are stronger correlations between our natal transits, the transits to our natal chart, or even global transits. But as one’s work deepens, when you begin to go into and beyond archetypal reality—beyond time and space and deep into the universe—I think there's a roll off effect of the planetary correlates to experience.</p>

<p>work. Whether those correlations continue to be as strong in the later stages, I'm not as convinced.
In terms of my own chart, that gets complicated. I have a lot of Neptune and a lot of water in my chart. I have a Sun square Neptune with Neptune in the first house, and other dynamics. I was destined to do this type of work. I also want to mention the ocean of suffering. This was not something forced on me. I didn't understand it at the time, and I don't think the universe forces any of us into this type of work. It was too hard, too demanding, too difficult to have been forced on me. What I learned over time is that this is something I voluntarily took on in this incarnation. It was part of the plan of my incarnation to do this work, and to do the ocean of suffering work in particular. I'm a volunteer, and I think when we get into this deep muck, we're volunteers for this work.</p>

<p>new spiritual experience and reality as it unfolds. I suppose we’re all participants in creating it.
Chris Bache: The movements you mentioned—neo-paganism and eco-spirituality—I see both as attempting to put nature back into spiritual discourse, which was one of the things lost in the classic patriarchal religions. They’re trying to bring us back to the innate wisdom of nature, a wisdom that runs throughout our consciousness and our bodies, connecting our body consciousness to the body consciousness of Earth. Eco-spirituality is a way of experiencing spirituality that connects us to the planet and to the stars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see this in the resurgence of interest in astrology—not a naive, mechanistic astrology, but the vision that the universe has a pulse to it. The galaxies have a pulse, our solar system has a pulse, and if you know how to read that pulse, you can feel how your body and destiny unfold in rhythm with it. That’s a form of eco-spirituality—solar spirituality, galactic spirituality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ologically, and specifically, has anything correlated to a breakthrough—to moving to a higher level?
Chris Bache: Good question, and a complicated one. Rick Tarnas is a good friend, as is Stan, and I'm aware of Stan's writing and his analysis of cases and the astrological correlations of people going through breakthroughs. I'm aware of the proposal that the outer planets correlating with the perinatal matrices seem to be somewhat predictive of patterns of oppression, contraction, breakthrough, and liberation in people's experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've looked at these correlations in my own work. First of all, I completely accept the proposal they've made. I understand it. It makes sense. The intelligence of the universe that I experience makes it intuitive that the rhythm of the universe would be part of the rhythm of this intelligence, and that as we open beyond the personal psyche there would be a kind of solar system pulse in the nature of our experiences.</p>

<p>smology—which resonates deeply with the psychedelic cosmology Stan has described in The Cosmic Game.
Aurobindo’s vision is of a cascading involution of the Divine, generating multiple levels of reality—all divine, but within those levels, a descending scale of self-awareness of divinity, like a series of one-way mirrors: the divine looking down sees all; the divine looking up sees less. At the end of Dark Night, Early Dawn, I noted that, in a multilevel cosmology, a death-rebirth event can function as both liberation from below to above, and infusion from above to below. At the threshold, one can feel energy moving in both directions—death-rebirth as ascent and descent.</p>

<p>t so it doesn’t repeat. Does transmutation of karma play a huge part in this reincarnative theology?
Chris Bache: If we just look around us, it’s a web of cause and effect. We live in a continuous web: the air we breathe, the weather patterns, our biology, what we ate, the purity of what we ate, the movement of the planets. Here we’re focusing on that portion of the web that influences the development of the soul—our human psychophysical development—which is a subset of this larger cause-and-effect fabric.</p>

On the positive side, once I went through the ocean in that next year, I entered a domain of consciousness that took me beyond anything to do with personal reality—into the mind of the universe. In the section I call initiation into the universe, at a different time of life and with different astrological transits, I was given a series of carefully orchestrated teachings—initiations into the cosmic order of things. I always give sessions names as mnemonic devices; I write them down in bullet points and name them to remember the journey all at once. The names in that chapter—initiation into the universe—give you the flavor of how profoundly transpersonal these experiences were. It was a deep excursion in cosmology 101: how the universe works at a fundamental level.</p>

The creative intelligence thinks in terms of billions of years, of species and planetary systems and galactic systems.

It helps us understand tensions woven into our body and mind and invites us to participate more fully in the divine project.</p>

When I think about where reincarnation is taking us—the larger scope and purpose of rebirth—I turn to the pictures NASA sends around every day. I collect and meditate on them, try to envision the enormous distances and the millions and billions of stars, and the life burgeoning on so many planets and systems. The sheer fertility—the profligate fertility—of the universe, and the scale at which the universe is thinking to create and manifest orders upon orders of evolving life on this magnitude. And then to appreciate that we are part of this.</p>

This birth of soul consciousness inside time is happening as the planet tries to come to terms with its divisive history and confronts problems that can’t be solved at the national level, only the global. As we try to come together as one planet, internally the players are trying to come together as one soul. There’s reciprocity between the outer political-ecological dynamic and the inner psycho-spiritual one. The ego built this world, but the ego will never be able to solve the problems we’ve generated. It takes the expansion of the soul—the depth of courage, compassion, and insight—to carry us into the next stage of our planetary evolution.</p>

Michael Newton wrote two wonderful books. If you read only one or two from this list, I hope you’ll read Newton. A hypnotherapist doing past-life therapy, he accidentally discovered that clients in deep hypnosis could remember not only previous lives but what happened after they died. He followed them—good therapist that he is—through death into the afterlife memories and asked careful questions, keeping detailed notes. Regardless of background—fundamentalist Baptist, Karl Marxist atheist, hard-core scientific reductionist—people described the same fundamental reality in the after-death state: a world with order, structure, and logic; a social structure where older learners teach younger learners; and a place where reincarnation is a conscious, careful choice. It’s like choosing college courses: once you sign up, you’re committed for the semester. Incarnating is an important choice made under the guidance of spiritual helpers and in cooperation with the people you’ll incarnate with. Before we were born—when we knew more than we know now—we chose the life we’re living. That fact alone bears deep meditation.</p>

In addition to what you mention, we have Hopi prophecies and others from indigenous cultures that have long spoken of profound transformation. It does line up. The general perception is that we are in a period of darkness, but I’d conceptualize that darkness as the conditioning of the past—the karmic patterns shaping the human psyche at deep structural levels—being driven to the surface. We are entering a period of infusion of grace and energy that’s driving the past up so we can deal with it: the hatreds of history, the divisions of race, gender, nationality, haves and have-nots—all the patterns of splitting the world into categories—are being driven out of us. They have to come out to make us available to the influx of divine energy entering us, whether you think of it as coming from above or from within. There’s something deeply true in these ancient prophecies: we are, in a sense, in the age of the Kali Yuga and coming into a profound new age. When and how we get there, I don't know, but there’s a relationship.</p>

When I resumed, the ocean of suffering started exactly where it had stopped and continued to build in intensity over the remaining year—seven more sessions in a different time of my life with different expectations and under different astrological transits. The ocean began exactly where it had stopped, which I think reflects the depth and power of the intelligence and consciousness directing these episodes—certainly not my intelligence, something larger than me.</p>

The therapist’s story—healing the personal psyche—is vitally important work; it’s just not the story I’m telling. I’m telling the story of a love affair with the universe and with the intelligence of the universe. My name for this intelligence is “my Beloved,” because engaging it activates such profound love in your being. It’s the most intimate kind of true becoming-one to a preexisting One. I wish it were not a love affair but an abiding marriage—maybe one day it will be. But these are temporary states, not permanent ones. You have to come to terms with that temporariness. It’s very much like an affair: you enter, make love in some way, then come back and try to live it as best you can inside time and space.</p>

<p>he universe, allowing a more intimate rapport to develop, a rapport that has immediate consequences.
Since all the intelligence, all the answers we could ever want, already exist inside the divine mind—divine reality—I use “divine” not in a theistic, culturally narrow sense, but in a post-religious, broader horizon, on the scale science has shown us: a universe billions of years old, a creative project billions of years in the making, a framework that dwarfs all the religions of history. This process is taking us into a new and unprecedented opportunity. And so this is a hard time—the time of birth. Gestation is long; labor is fast. We have been gestating the future human for thousands of years through our evolutionary reincarnation dynamic. But the time of giving birth to this new human is now. It’s short, intense, hard, painful—and magnificent. The project is coming into fruition. It’s hard to let go of our habits of the past, but it’s a time of grace.</p>

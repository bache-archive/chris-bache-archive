> Christopher M. Bache is a scholar known for his exploration of the intersections between psychology, spirituality, and astrology. His work often examines the influence of cosmic patterns on human experiences, particularly in altered states of consciousness. Bache's research contributes to a broader understanding of how astrological dynamics may correlate with personal and collective psychological processes. This page provides an overview of his key ideas and contributions to the fields of transpersonal psychology and astrological studies.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §6 ¶3**

> There may be another factor that influences what emerges in our sessions. Because our solar system is constantly moving, the variable of planetary setting changes in subtle ways from day to day and month to month. In a collaboration of many years, Stan Grof and Richard Tarnas have proposed the bold hypothesis that people’s experiences in deep nonordinary states move in synchrony with the rhythms of our solar system. Using case histories, Grof has argued that natal and transit astrology can illumine and even predict the tenor of one’s psychedelic session on any given day. This is too large a topic for me to take up here, but in the interest of encouraging this discussion, I will give my birth information and the dates of all my sessions in appendix II at the end of the book.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §7 ¶14**

> In the world that Newton is describing, life is a long spiral of learning. Each lifetime on Earth is balanced in the interlife with periods of rest and replenishing. When the time is right, the Soul begins the process of choosing its next incarnation, and this brings me to my reason for introducing Newton’s work here. Newton’s clients report that choosing an incarnation is something that is done with great care. Acting with the assistance of our spiritual mentors and in concert with the Souls with whom we will share this incarnation, we consciously choose our next life on Earth. For this to be an informed choice, we must be able to see what these future lives will consist of, and this future-seeing takes place at what Newton calls the Ring of Destiny.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §2 ¶6**

> Ancient. Huge. Panoramic in scope. Celestial but facing Earth. Creating through humanity. Living through humanity. Satisfying themselves through humanity. I saw deeply into the fact that events in space-time echoed the intention of the Forces and Beings of this dimension. It was they who were living and working through the collective patterns of history. It was they who were loving through the embrace of thousands of Romeos and Juliets across the planet.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §1 ¶16**

> I don’t know whether I would have made it completely off the mountain were it not for Christina’s love. A journeyer herself, she understood the challenge I was facing. She held me in the years of sadness, believed in me when I doubted myself, and soothed me when wholeness seemed so far away. I owe her more than I can repay. A lover of the Earth and daughter of the stars, she never tires of mapping the variety the Infinite pours into each of our lives, uncovering the potent destinies hidden in our astrological charts.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §2 ¶6**

> Through all these experiences, there flowed a deep sense that the circumstances of our lives were being shaped by forces beyond our immediate awareness. Our lives were “etched in the universe.” There were many messages about rootedness, bonding, and age.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §0 ¶2**

> Archetypes thus can be understood and described in many ways, and much of the history of Western thought has evolved and revolved around this very issue.

> planet seemed destined to eventually extend beyond our solar system. Earth seemed to be a hothouse, growing a capacity for conscious creation that would in time be exported to other systems in the galaxy.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §7 ¶16**

> The choices we make at the Ring of Destiny will become our earthly destiny—not a fixed destiny with a predetermined outcome but a destiny of structured possibilities. In choosing a life, we are choosing a life script, a set of circumstances and conditions that are defined but open-ended. Once we have made our choice, the knowledge we have acquired about our next incarnation is taken away from us through the imposition of a deliberate amnesia, because too much foreknowledge would undermine the learning exercise. What we retain is a felt sense of direction and purpose, an inner instinct that tells us when we are on or off course in our lives. In addition, markers are planted in our unconscious to help us recognize significant people and events when we encounter them on Earth. The bottom line is this: when we knew more than we know now, when future probabilities were clearer to us than they are now, we chose the life we are currently living.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §3 ¶4**

> In a series of visions, I saw that the conflicts my wife and I had been having were rooted in a difference in our “soul age.” Soul age is simply a metaphor for spiritual development rooted in a reincar-national worldview. “Older souls” are seen as being more spiritually developed than “younger souls,” presumably from having lived more lifetimes on Earth. In my sessions, I saw that Carol was spiritually older than I was, with a heightened spiritual sensitivity and more developed capacity for contemplative practice. I saw myself as being younger, as coming more recently from lifetimes of middle age and only now moving into early wisdom. Carol already knew of things that I was just learning about.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §2 ¶8**

> Our intertwined destinies were part of a larger unfolding, and there was power in this unfolding. On a personal level, the message was, “Follow the natural slope of your life. Struggle is not necessary.” The circumstances of my life were being shaped by processes deeper than my conscious ego could track. My well-being lay in trusting these circumstances and responding to them as deeply as I could.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §4 ¶2**

> My notes from these sessions are filled with references to a “deeper intentionality,” to “causal forces arching through time” and “the given of our lives.” My understanding of life was being expanded and deepened. I was being given a new mythos for how life works. As a professor of religious studies, I recognized that this new mythos was actually an old mythos, though not one I knew much about at the time. It was the mythos of reincarnation and the soul. In the years that followed, the theme of reincarnation wove itself in and out of my sessions many times, both as a general principle and as personal memories of some of my former lives. Because of its recurring presence in my sessions, let me step to the side for a moment and say something about reincarnation here.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §1 ¶26**

> I experienced myself as being me, surrounded by the people and activities of my familiar world, and yet I had become completely hollow, emptied of all personal content, and in the end transparent to a fluid, golden Intelligence that permeated all reality and was flowing through me into whoever or whatever was in front of me. The image that stood out in my mind to frame this was the Sun-Neptune square in my natal chart. It was as if my individuality (Sun) had yielded completely to the Divine (Neptune) and had become transparent to its vast energies.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §3 ¶2**

> This eruption of *bhaktian* devotion caught me by surprise because it was completely different from my usual approach to spirituality, which has always been more mental in character. Of the four spiritual paths in Hinduism—*jnana* (knowledge), *karma* (service), *raja* (meditation), and *bhakti* (devotion)—*bhakti* is the path I have least identified with, and yet here it was.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §4 ¶14**

> **Death and Rebirth**

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §4 ¶1**

> I am being given a new mythos in which to understand my life, replacing the mythos of family history psychodynamically construed. With this new mythos comes a deeper understanding of karma and a deeper sense of responsibility. (Session 12)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §11 ¶2**

> I think that Sri Aurobindo was correct when he said that these cosmologies reflect an incomplete understanding of existence. They reflect the deepening of humanity’s contact with the spiritual universe that took place about three to four thousand years ago. Once we began to gain *experiential* access to the bliss of this mother universe through meditation, yoga, and psychedelic substances, how could we not but conclude that we “belonged” there more than here, that Earth was not our “true home,” and that we had “fallen” from paradise through some kind of cosmic blunder? Our enthusiasm for these theologies of return is understandable given their historical context, but in the context of the dramatically expanded understanding of the universe emerging in science combined with our deepening psychedelic experience, we are beginning to see that these theologies reflect an incomplete model of the cosmos.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶41**

> As we begin to grasp the true scale of nature’s intent, we must revise many of our previous assumptions about reincarnation. In the classic up-and-out model of rebirth, for example, it is often said that it is a “law” of reincarnation that we are not allowed to remember our former lives when we are born. This amnesia is essential because if we were able to remember our former lives, it would overwhelm our earthly identity. Our present life would become unmanageable if we remembered everything we had ever been and done in our previous lifetimes. Numerous Hollywood movies have played with this theme. But this way of thinking is too small and fails to grasp the fact that reincarnation is an *evolutionary driver* whose effects accumulate not only in spiritual reality but inside space-time as well.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §0 ¶1**

> The passionate longing of the human heart has always been to press beyond the boundaries of the known, to break through the limitations of our understanding, to extend the horizon of awareness. This is perhaps our most fundamental and essential freedom.
> —Anne Baring, *The Dream of the Cosmos*

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶21**

> Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book *The Cosmic Game*. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶24**

> While these kinds of responses might be expected in certain types of courses, such as a counseling course, this was not the case for the kinds of courses I was teaching, which were Introduction to World Religions, Religion and the Earth, Psychology of Religion, Transpersonal Studies, and Buddhism. It was not the content of the course that seemed to be driving these effects but something deeper. What was triggering these effects was not what I was doing but what I had become through my psychedelic practice. Because of this work, my core energy was changing. A field of energy moving through me or around me was growing stronger, causing a spontaneous *energetic resonance* to spring up between me and my students underneath the exchange of ideas in the classroom.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §6 ¶3 (1 · 6)**

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)**

> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶2 (1 · 3)**

> From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path that has been well documented by scholars. From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)**

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)**

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)**

> LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶21 (1)**

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)**

> If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶3 (10 · 0)**

> Light has always been recognized as a signature of the Divine. It is a universal constant in our spiritual traditions—a vast radiance fusing all knowledge, love, and power. Mystics attest to it; those who have nearly died attest to it. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that when our psychedelic journey takes us deep into the universe, the Light is waiting for us.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶13 (10 · 3)**

> I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics and the reservations some teachers have about them as agents of spiritual transformation. And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §0 ¶2 (1 · 0)**

> In this opening chapter, I want to candidly describe how I worked with LSD and share some core observations about the psychedelic process. Even as psychedelic research resumes, there is still a great deal of misinformation and mistrust of psychedelics in our culture. By putting my cards on the table up front, I hope to create as clear a field as possible for the story that follows. Readers who are not familiar with the psychedelic literature will get a solid understanding of how this method of inquiry works, while those who know this literature well will see how I have adapted and personalized it.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §7 ¶1 (5 · 7)**

> The claim that it is possible to experience one’s future in psychedelic states of consciousness represents such a challenge to our thinking that I thought it might be helpful to look briefly at two other circumstances in which people appear to get glimpses into their future. The first is when people come close to dying (near-death experiences), and the second is past-life hypnotherapy. Though each of these may be controversial in their own right, they are a source of fascinating observations that, when combined with psychedelic experience, reinforce a sense of the possible that deserves our attention. They will also deepen the story of reincarnation begun here.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶3 (12 · 3)**

> That the universe is the manifest body of a Divine Being of unimaginable intelligence, compassion, clarity, and power, that we are all aspects of this Being, never separated from it for a moment, that we are growing ever more aware of this connection, that physical reality emerges out of Light and returns to Light continuously, that Light is our essential nature and our destiny, that all life moves as One, that reincarnation is true, that there is a deep logic and significance to the circumstances of our lives, that everything we do contributes to the evolution of the whole, that our awareness continues in an ocean of time and a sea of bliss when we die, that we are loved beyond measure and that humanity is driving towards an evolutionary breakthrough that will change us and life on this planet at the deepest level. (Bache 2017)

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §7 ¶9 (7 · 7)**

> Experiencing human existence as a completely unified field made everything much easier to understand. The latticework of Mind that saturates and coordinates our individual lives has a logic to it that subsumes our individual perspectives. Today, physical reality was dissolving into its underlying matrix, and with it the reality of individual psyches disappeared. What I had previously conceptualized in atomistic terms as individual people choosing to reincarnate in order to clear their personal karmic patterns, I was now experiencing as a centralized decision to incarnate entire generations to cleanse the human mind-field of its collective karmic legacy. I saw no sustainable distinctions between individuals, only the web of life operating in an integrated, unified manner.

> as a reincarnation from or to another planet or star system. Do you have anything to say about that?
Chris Bache:
I’d say, why not? Once you understand that the dynamic principles of evolution are playing themselves out in other solar systems and galaxies, and you run the numbers, it’s kind of like: there’s got to be intelligent life out there. If we can incarnate, then they can incarnate. Distance is immaterial. There are people who have conscious recall of having been a life form on another planet. I can’t remember her name, but there’s a woman who does past-life therapy with a major focus on helping people integrate incarnations from other planetary lifetimes. Do a little digging around. I personally don’t have conscious recall of such, though I was at a spiritual workshop where a teacher had recall that he, I, and one other person there had shared another planetary system in another incarnation. So I say: okay, why not?

Dottie Koontz:
We have time for one last question—unless you’d like to have a last say.

> Chris a chance to connect the living universe with the evolution of life through that living system.
Chris Bache
In that context, let me say something hard and consoling at the same time. From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.

Chris, who spoke here a couple of years ago, was wonderful, and many of you have read his books and appreciated the work he’s done. Chris is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He’s also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an Emeritus Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the board of the Grof Legacy Training. An award-winning teacher and international speaker, Chris has written four books: Life Cycles about reincarnation; Dark Night, Early Dawn on pioneering work in psychedelic philosophy; The Living Classroom, an exploration of collective fields of consciousness in teaching; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe, the story of his 20-year journey with LSD—which is a fabulous book. Chris lives in Weaverville, North Carolina, with his wife, Christina Hardy, a professional astrologer and past-life therapist. So, Chris, take it away—and thank you for being here.

> art, but to continue evolving. Do you feel your journey confirms Buddhism, and where does it differ?
Chris Bache
I’ve been deeply influenced by all the world’s religions. I began as a Christian and a Catholic—four years in seminary studying for the priesthood. I studied Hebrew and Greek for biblical work. I’ve learned so much from Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Native traditions. The two deepest, longest-lasting influences on me have been Christianity and Buddhism.

I think my journey affirms the deepest truths of Christianity and of all the world’s religions—Judaism’s Kabbalah, Hinduism, Buddhism—while also, in important ways, eclipsing the religions of the last several thousand years. The universe I was initiated into demanded levels of understanding beyond anything I had learned in those traditions. I had to become operational within a deeper metaphysics.

Along the way, another transformation was pending. Chris read Stanislav Grof’s work on the use of psychedelics in psychotherapy, the non-dogmatic influences of Buddhism and Huston Smith’s perennialism. We know an integral soon followed. Chris ended his psychedelic explorations in 1999, and it wasn't until 2009 he wrote his first book, The Living Classroom. Here he shared how his expansive consciousness seemed to impact his students in what he called leaky boundaries. Again, those of us in integral recognize the psychoactive effect presencing has upon others. In 2019 he wrote LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven, some of which he'll share today and at the conference. Please give Chris Bache a warm San Diego Integral welcome.

Yeah. Go ahead, Chris.
Chris Bache
The field of study that shifted my thinking about these matters was reincarnation research. Because even though I finished graduate school in philosophy of religion, by the end, I was pretty atheistically inclined—an agnostic. I was well versed in the rise of science and human values and fully embraced that movement. I tell my students, if you haven't fallen in love with Kant and with science, you've missed one of the great romances of history—it's a massive, ground-shaking pivot in human understanding.

Before I ask Chris to say anything, a short bio with a couple of comments. Christopher M. Bache is professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at Youngstown State University, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies and a fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences. An award-winning teacher, Chris explores the philosophical implications of non-ordinary states of consciousness, especially psychedelic states. He has written three books—Life Cycles, Dark Night, Early Dawn (which I read about 20 years ago, a wonderful book), The Living Classroom (which I haven’t read)—and, more recently, LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven.

Chris Bache:
…shared in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—infused with mind and soul. And, of course, now we know how vast the physical universe is, and the question becomes: how large is the mind of the universe? How deep is it?

I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.

Chris Bache:
Hi, Iain.
Iain McNay:
We found Chris quite recently—he was giving a lecture in London. I read his short bio that came along with the lecture details, and I thought, what a fascinating chap. So I invited him, and he very kindly agreed to come along and talk with us today. Chris has written three books—I only have two here, but one is Lifecycles: A Study of Reincarnation in Light of Contemporary Consciousness Research. Then there's this one, Dark Night, Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind, and The Living Classroom: Teaching and Collective Consciousness. He has a new book, which isn't published yet, called Diamonds from Heaven: A 20 Year Journey into the Mind of the Universe. So, Chris, let's start with the questions you had. You worked for many years lecturing in comparative religions, psychology to some degree. But there were questions that were burning inside you.

Thank you. We have questions in the chat. David, do you want to address some of them?
Donna Loeffler
That was a beautiful answer, Chris—so well said. John Hock has a question. David, while you look, why don’t we let John ask his question? Go ahead, John.

John Hock
A couple quick ones—well, the first may not be quick. I asked Stan Grof at one point if there was anything he could correlate a difficult trip with. He said his work with Tarnas and his own work turned up that a hard transit to Mars was the only thing he could point to that would predict a difficult trip, and at the time he was still working with Rick to go further. I find it fascinating that you charted correlations while doing your journeys. What have you seen correlate astrologically, and specifically, has anything correlated to a breakthrough—to moving to a higher level?

Chris Bache:
Basically, I made my living as a university professor at a modest university in Northeast Ohio. I'm a professor of religious studies. My background is a degree in theology from Notre Dame, study in New Testament criticism at Cambridge, and a PhD in Philosophy of Religion from Brown—very classically educated. I was raised in the Deep South, in Mississippi. When I finished my graduate training and came to Youngstown State University, where I taught for 33 years, I met the work of Stanislav Grof, one of the foremost authorities in integrating psychedelics into psychotherapy, and his work was a turning point in my life.

> cy. You say the universe is interested in our experience of it. Why do you believe that is the case?
Chris Bache:
Part of my experience reflects a classic teaching in some Eastern traditions: the essence of the individual is the same as the essence of the totality—Atman is Brahman. Our nature is the nature of the divine, which is the nature of reality itself. So it’s not completely accurate to frame this as a duality between me and It. At a deeper level, my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality. Our relationship is deeply essential and mutually participating from the start. But functionally, in terms of Chris Bache, I am so small and It is so vast that there’s a relative duality involved. And between my small bit and the totality are layers upon layers. It’s a very complex, organic system of massive scale.

Emmy Vadnais:
Yes—hello and welcome, everybody. We’re grateful to have Chris Bache with us today, professor emeritus in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Youngstown State University in Ohio, where he taught for 33 years. He is also adjunct faculty at the California Institute of Integral Studies, an Emeritus Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, and on the advisory council of Grof Legacy Training. Chris is author of Life Cycles: Reincarnation and the Web of Life; Dark Night, Early Dawn; The Living Classroom: Teaching and Collective Consciousness; and LSD and the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven. His website is chrisbache.com—with an “e” at the end. Welcome, Chris. We’re so happy to have you here today. To get us started, would you share a little about your background? And we also want to let people know that Chris has been a guest on New Thinking Allowed with a recorded interview talking about psychedelics and the cosmic mind.

> ce experiences were not marked by Saturn transits or Saturn global transits, or even Pluto transits.
When my work began to go off the edge of time and space—when I began to enter deeper and deeper into archetypal reality, and then beyond archetypal reality into Dharmakaya or the Diamond Luminosity—I felt a roll-off of astrological variables. My psychedelic dance did not map easily into the astrological dance. I began to think there might be a roll-off effect between one's solar dance and one's session experiences. This continues to be an area of active dialogue and consideration for me. There is an appendix in the book called “Pushing the Limits of Astrological Correspondence.” In that appendix I give the dates of all of my sessions. If one wanted to, one can look at my natal chart, look at the sessions, and examine the correlations or lack of correlations. I know there aren't enough sessions given to provide a definitive answer, but I wanted to support discussion about the relationship between astrology, astrological and global transits, and one's own psychedelic work. To me, that's an open question. I know there are correlations, particularly in the early stages of one's work. Whether those correlations continue to be as strong in the later stages, I'm not as convinced.

[01:12:23](https://youtu.be/uHn8lzYNXyE?t=4343)  — *LSD & the Mind of the Universe: Diamonds from Heaven* (2019-11-13) • 01:12:23

> se I was working in a collective context and could see these ripples coming back at me all the time.
On the issue of astrology and individual and global transits, this is a complicated question, and I'm not an astrologer, so I want to be careful. I tracked my sessions. I used astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from Rick Tarnas about correlations between outer planets and inner experience in psychedelic states. I planned my sessions by transits, and I tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs against the planets. I found a very complicated correlation. While there were correlations between my individual transits and global transits with the unfolding of my psychedelic experience, there were also differences I wasn't expecting—a failure to find correspondence. For example, my breakthroughs were not always paired with Uranus. My really intense, up-against-the-wall, death-in-your-face experiences were not marked by Saturn transits or Saturn global transits, or even Pluto transits.

> of a typical day. At the death-of-self level: a chapter on crossing the boundary of birth and death.
My wife is taking care of me, by the way. I forgot to mention: my wife, Christina, is a professional astrologer. Working with astrology and psychedelic sessions yields really interesting insights, and she helped me understand some of the archetypal dynamics in the material.

> nd the personal psyche there would be a kind of solar system pulse in the nature of our experiences.
That said, I have not found the correlations to be as striking as I expected. As my work deepened over the years, I couldn't correlate breakthroughs and impasses with astrological variables as much as I had anticipated. That led me to formulate what I call the roll off hypothesis: in the early stages of our work, or at lower doses—when our time-space identity is being unfolded and impacted—I think there are stronger correlations between our natal transits, the transits to our natal chart, or even global transits. But as one’s work deepens, when you begin to go into and beyond archetypal reality—beyond time and space and deep into the universe—I think there's a roll off effect of the planetary correlates to experience.

> work. Whether those correlations continue to be as strong in the later stages, I'm not as convinced.
In terms of my own chart, that gets complicated. I have a lot of Neptune and a lot of water in my chart. I have a Sun square Neptune with Neptune in the first house, and other dynamics. I was destined to do this type of work. I also want to mention the ocean of suffering. This was not something forced on me. I didn't understand it at the time, and I don't think the universe forces any of us into this type of work. It was too hard, too demanding, too difficult to have been forced on me. What I learned over time is that this is something I voluntarily took on in this incarnation. It was part of the plan of my incarnation to do this work, and to do the ocean of suffering work in particular. I'm a volunteer, and I think when we get into this deep muck, we're volunteers for this work.

> new spiritual experience and reality as it unfolds. I suppose we’re all participants in creating it.
Chris Bache: The movements you mentioned—neo-paganism and eco-spirituality—I see both as attempting to put nature back into spiritual discourse, which was one of the things lost in the classic patriarchal religions. They’re trying to bring us back to the innate wisdom of nature, a wisdom that runs throughout our consciousness and our bodies, connecting our body consciousness to the body consciousness of Earth. Eco-spirituality is a way of experiencing spirituality that connects us to the planet and to the stars.

We can see this in the resurgence of interest in astrology—not a naive, mechanistic astrology, but the vision that the universe has a pulse to it. The galaxies have a pulse, our solar system has a pulse, and if you know how to read that pulse, you can feel how your body and destiny unfold in rhythm with it. That’s a form of eco-spirituality—solar spirituality, galactic spirituality.

> ologically, and specifically, has anything correlated to a breakthrough—to moving to a higher level?
Chris Bache: Good question, and a complicated one. Rick Tarnas is a good friend, as is Stan, and I'm aware of Stan's writing and his analysis of cases and the astrological correlations of people going through breakthroughs. I'm aware of the proposal that the outer planets correlating with the perinatal matrices seem to be somewhat predictive of patterns of oppression, contraction, breakthrough, and liberation in people's experiences.

I've looked at these correlations in my own work. First of all, I completely accept the proposal they've made. I understand it. It makes sense. The intelligence of the universe that I experience makes it intuitive that the rhythm of the universe would be part of the rhythm of this intelligence, and that as we open beyond the personal psyche there would be a kind of solar system pulse in the nature of our experiences.

> smology—which resonates deeply with the psychedelic cosmology Stan has described in The Cosmic Game.
Aurobindo’s vision is of a cascading involution of the Divine, generating multiple levels of reality—all divine, but within those levels, a descending scale of self-awareness of divinity, like a series of one-way mirrors: the divine looking down sees all; the divine looking up sees less. At the end of Dark Night, Early Dawn, I noted that, in a multilevel cosmology, a death-rebirth event can function as both liberation from below to above, and infusion from above to below. At the threshold, one can feel energy moving in both directions—death-rebirth as ascent and descent.

> t so it doesn’t repeat. Does transmutation of karma play a huge part in this reincarnative theology?
Chris Bache: If we just look around us, it’s a web of cause and effect. We live in a continuous web: the air we breathe, the weather patterns, our biology, what we ate, the purity of what we ate, the movement of the planets. Here we’re focusing on that portion of the web that influences the development of the soul—our human psychophysical development—which is a subset of this larger cause-and-effect fabric.

On the positive side, once I went through the ocean in that next year, I entered a domain of consciousness that took me beyond anything to do with personal reality—into the mind of the universe. In the section I call initiation into the universe, at a different time of life and with different astrological transits, I was given a series of carefully orchestrated teachings—initiations into the cosmic order of things. I always give sessions names as mnemonic devices; I write them down in bullet points and name them to remember the journey all at once. The names in that chapter—initiation into the universe—give you the flavor of how profoundly transpersonal these experiences were. It was a deep excursion in cosmology 101: how the universe works at a fundamental level.

If Christology is the study of the Christ archetype, for me that archetype is bigger than Jesus. It’s a larger dynamic of profound awakening of the human heart, mind, and spirit. I live and breathe in Universalist waters: recognizing the distinctness of each lineage and the overlapping common ground.

My life has been deeply influenced by all the spiritual traditions of the world—I taught world religions for years, and I consider them all dear friends—but the two that have influenced me most deeply are Christianity and Buddhism. I think you’re absolutely right: what we’re looking at is heaven on Earth. That is the vision moving forward—an embodiment of heavenly states of consciousness in our physical existence.

If we really want to go deep into this collective transformation, it’s a good time to step back into a larger context—into the presence of the creative intelligence of the universe, the divine intelligence, the great power. The starlights behind me are not just stars. Some are stars, but many are galaxies with billions and billions of stars—an unimaginable outpouring of power and genius. It’s the same genius that birthed this universe, that is birthing this time in history, and that has placed us here to participate consciously in this milestone century. We will come out of this century profoundly different than we came into it.

Now that we better grasp how huge the universe is and how long it’s been around, if you want to understand life you have to begin to think like God—like a galaxy. The creative intelligence thinks in terms of billions of years, of species and planetary systems and galactic systems. We have to expand to understand our role in such a universe, and reincarnation allows us to do that. It helps us understand tensions woven into our body and mind and invites us to participate more fully in the divine project.

When I think about where reincarnation is taking us—the larger scope and purpose of rebirth—I turn to the pictures NASA sends around every day. I collect and meditate on them, try to envision the enormous distances and the millions and billions of stars, and the life burgeoning on so many planets and systems. The sheer fertility—the profligate fertility—of the universe, and the scale at which the universe is thinking to create and manifest orders upon orders of evolving life on this magnitude. And then to appreciate that we are part of this.

This birth of soul consciousness inside time is happening as the planet tries to come to terms with its divisive history and confronts problems that can’t be solved at the national level, only the global. As we try to come together as one planet, internally the players are trying to come together as one soul. There’s reciprocity between the outer political-ecological dynamic and the inner psycho-spiritual one. The ego built this world, but the ego will never be able to solve the problems we’ve generated. It takes the expansion of the soul—the depth of courage, compassion, and insight—to carry us into the next stage of our planetary evolution.

Michael Newton wrote two wonderful books. If you read only one or two from this list, I hope you’ll read Newton. A hypnotherapist doing past-life therapy, he accidentally discovered that clients in deep hypnosis could remember not only previous lives but what happened after they died. He followed them—good therapist that he is—through death into the afterlife memories and asked careful questions, keeping detailed notes. Regardless of background—fundamentalist Baptist, Karl Marxist atheist, hard-core scientific reductionist—people described the same fundamental reality in the after-death state: a world with order, structure, and logic; a social structure where older learners teach younger learners; and a place where reincarnation is a conscious, careful choice. It’s like choosing college courses: once you sign up, you’re committed for the semester. Incarnating is an important choice made under the guidance of spiritual helpers and in cooperation with the people you’ll incarnate with. Before we were born—when we knew more than we know now—we chose the life we’re living. That fact alone bears deep meditation.

Chris Bache
In addition to what you mention, we have Hopi prophecies and others from indigenous cultures that have long spoken of profound transformation. It does line up. The general perception is that we are in a period of darkness, but I’d conceptualize that darkness as the conditioning of the past—the karmic patterns shaping the human psyche at deep structural levels—being driven to the surface. We are entering a period of infusion of grace and energy that’s driving the past up so we can deal with it: the hatreds of history, the divisions of race, gender, nationality, haves and have-nots—all the patterns of splitting the world into categories—are being driven out of us. They have to come out to make us available to the influx of divine energy entering us, whether you think of it as coming from above or from within. There’s something deeply true in these ancient prophecies: we are, in a sense, in the age of the Kali Yuga and coming into a profound new age. When and how we get there, I don't know, but there’s a relationship.

I then stopped my work for six years for reasons I describe in the book. When I resumed, the ocean of suffering started exactly where it had stopped and continued to build in intensity over the remaining year—seven more sessions in a different time of my life with different expectations and under different astrological transits. The ocean began exactly where it had stopped, which I think reflects the depth and power of the intelligence and consciousness directing these episodes—certainly not my intelligence, something larger than me.

The therapist’s story—healing the personal psyche—is vitally important work; it’s just not the story I’m telling. I’m telling the story of a love affair with the universe and with the intelligence of the universe. My name for this intelligence is “my Beloved,” because engaging it activates such profound love in your being. It’s the most intimate kind of true becoming-one to a preexisting One. I wish it were not a love affair but an abiding marriage—maybe one day it will be. But these are temporary states, not permanent ones. You have to come to terms with that temporariness. It’s very much like an affair: you enter, make love in some way, then come back and try to live it as best you can inside time and space.

> he universe, allowing a more intimate rapport to develop, a rapport that has immediate consequences.
Since all the intelligence, all the answers we could ever want, already exist inside the divine mind—divine reality—I use “divine” not in a theistic, culturally narrow sense, but in a post-religious, broader horizon, on the scale science has shown us: a universe billions of years old, a creative project billions of years in the making, a framework that dwarfs all the religions of history. This process is taking us into a new and unprecedented opportunity. And so this is a hard time—the time of birth. Gestation is long; labor is fast. We have been gestating the future human for thousands of years through our evolutionary reincarnation dynamic. But the time of giving birth to this new human is now. It’s short, intense, hard, painful—and magnificent. The project is coming into fruition. It’s hard to let go of our habits of the past, but it’s a time of grace.

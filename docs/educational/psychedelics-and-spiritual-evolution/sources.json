LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?",

From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.",

And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.",

According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.",

They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know.

Where do you see psychedelics playing a role in this evolution?\nChris Bache: I understand the very strong emphasis in the psychedelic community on demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of psychedelics. It’s really important that we not blow this opportunity. We kind of blew it in the ’60s—it blew up in our faces. We lost the right to use these things and had to go underground. It’s important that with this new opportunity we document and demonstrate their effectiveness. Right now their effectiveness is being demonstrated in their therapeutic potential. But if we keep going, it’s only a matter of time before mainstream thinkers begin to understand why psychedelics are so therapeutically effective: because they open communion with the deeper dimensions of mind. In the early stages, this encounter with the deeper dimensions of our consciousness is very cleansing, very healing—therapeutically efficacious. That can be demonstrated. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We go deeper, and deeper. It opens our relationship to each other, to the planet, to other life forms. It opens our relationship to spiritual reality. I was trained as a philosopher of religion, and it’s always been the philosophical import of psychedelics that has interested me. I’m not a clinician or therapist. I’m interested in the philosophical and cosmological opportunities. From that perspective, we’re coming to a critical moment in history. It’s not enough just to heal us at this moment. We have to heal not simply the personal unconscious—though that’s very important—we have to heal the soul, the fundamental human condition. That means recovering an understanding of what we are, who we are, where we are, what existence is about. Psychedelics are being rediscovered in Western industrial cultures—indigenous cultures have had them a long time—where we’ve lost contact with the deeper levels of our own psyche, with the consciousness of the Earth, with the consciousness of the creator of galaxies. Psychedelics can awaken us quickly, jar us into awareness of this deeper dimension at exactly the time we need it. We can’t get through this period of history with the limited understanding of ourselves that grew out of 19th-century science—this materialist, mechanistic, reductionistic understanding—which is an absolutely devastating worldview to try to live in. That we come into existence by accident, it’s all random, there’s no meaning to it—no meaning to our individual challenges, no meaning to history. That worldview leads to the kind of planet we’ve developed, where we try to eat it all alive and get as much experience as we can because when we die it’s all over and was an exercise in futility anyway. Psychedelics help us understand that’s not true. It’s a very different agenda.",

The ways in which psychedelics have come back into our culture—both from Central and South American cultures that have kept traditions alive, and through the new psychedelics. LSD is often compared to the atom bomb; they were discovered at the same time. It’s an exponential opportunity to explore dimensions of consciousness that previous generations, for the most part, had to spend lifetimes meditating just to access. Now people of even modest spiritual capacities can have temporary experiences of these realities, which require a profound redrafting of our existential assumptions about how life works.",

As we develop our potentials and make this turning point—as we mature as a species—what kind of human being are we becoming? What are the potentials we are activating? I think it’s far beyond what we see even in science fiction. I want to build up to that by pivoting more directly to psychedelics.\n\nThis is something both Duane and I share, and I suspect a high percentage of people in this room have used psychedelics responsibly as part of their personal history or spiritual practice, just as many do yoga or meditation. Psychedelics are part of the arsenal not only of spiritual healing—healing the soul—but of becoming more aware of what our lives are about and what life itself is about.",

In therapeutically or spiritually focused psychedelic sessions, you speed up what happens in life at a slower pace. In reincarnation, we grow and evolve: die, return to soul consciousness; are born, contract into egoic consciousness; die, return to soul consciousness—again and again. We choose lives that challenge, stretch, and heal us, develop new talents, deepen capacities.\n\nPsychedelic therapy accelerates that process. Long, sustained meditation retreats do too. You bite off larger pieces of personal karma. But then something else takes over. It’s not about your personal enlightenment anymore. Your ties to the human family, the family of life, the universe deepen. You begin to feel engaged in a profound life process.",

I taught psychology of religion, transpersonal studies, and comparative mysticism. I initially thought these sessions would help me break through obstacles in my contemplative practice. What I found was a protocol of spiritual exploration that took me deeper than I imagined possible. After a couple of years, I developed an aptitude for working in these states. I never stopped meditating—I always meditated, did yoga, and various practices. In fact, the deeper you want to go with psychedelics, the more important a daily spiritual practice becomes to anchor and absorb what you unleash. Psychedelics gave me access to states you can reach with meditation, but typically only with many lifetimes of practice. I differentiate between the path of temporary immersion—working with psychedelics, immersed for hours at a time—and the path of presence—contemplative presence—which is slower but tends to produce abiding transparency. They’re complementary approaches, but different.",

And I want to say this—there’s a lot of discussion about psychedelics and enlightenment: do psychedelics lead to enlightenment? Are they counterproductive or productive? These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.",

        "text": "t and matter, learning as it evolved? Do you view psychedelics as playing a role in history as well?\nChris Bache\nTerence’s hypothesis is interesting, but I don't have an opinion or any new insights to add. I hold it as an interesting hypothesis without an independent way of assessing it. I do think we are at a turning point in history—a make-or-break point—and psychedelics have a significant role to play. They give us extra awareness when we desperately need it, and a form of accelerated, deep healing when we desperately need that. There is a tremendous inner fermentation and detoxification happening at the collective as well as individual level. It manifests in our individual lives as an up-rushing of karmic content, conditioning, pain, and trauma we’ve been carrying in our soul history. This is happening not just to a few middle-class individuals who can attend to it, but underneath our social movements and the world at large. Psychedelics, by amplifying consciousness—our own and the consciousness we are part of—help us heal and manage this purification process, and they widen our worldview. One good deep experience of communion with the deep structure of the universe can shatter materialism—the philosophy that matter is the only thing that's real. I think Huston Smith was right: a mystical experience does not a mystic make, but a mystical experience can an atheist unmake. How far will this go? How deep will psychedelic healing reach in our culture? How fast will insights realized under psychedelic communion contribute to the paradigm shift, which is being driven by multiple disciplines right now? I don't know. But the fact that LSD was invented in the same decade as the nuclear bomb, and the nuclear bomb changed the global order, may be a significant synchronicity.",

Maybe we can start with psychedelics—how did psychedelics come on your radar initially?\nChris Bache\nI had just finished graduate school, was publishing a few articles out of my dissertation, and looking for where to take my research. I was a brand-new university professor when I met the work of Stanislav Grof, and that snapped my head to attention. I did not have a psychedelic history. I finished graduate school in religious studies as a pretty deeply convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. But I read Stan’s work and a light bulb went off. I said, this is important—not just to psychology, but to philosophy of religion, which was my training. I wanted to get involved, but it had been made illegal. So I split my life. In my day job, I functioned as a professor of religious studies, teaching conventional or semi-conventional courses. And I began what eventually became a 20-year journey working with LSD, following Stan’s paradigm and then pushing the limits of that paradigm much farther than I appreciated at the time. Trained in philosophy of religion, I kept careful records and notes, trying to make the engagement as clean and productive as possible. I knew there would come a time to share the insights with a broader audience. After I retired from the university, that time finally came.",

What’s your answer right now?\nChris Bache:\nIf we do this work not simply to generate temporary highs or insights but to facilitate a maturation of our psycho-spiritual life that leads to an abiding shift—less about peak experiences and more about plateau experiences—then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. We enter these states for only a few hours, and then we come out and reconcile ourselves to the limitations of the practice. But if we use those hours carefully and conscientiously, they can accelerate our evolution. By showing us where we’re going, they act as strange attractors, drawing us into our individual and collective evolution faster and more deeply.\n\nIt is frustrating to be so deeply immersed in the wisdom of the universe at two in the afternoon and by ten that night feel your ordinary mind congeal around itself again. What is the value of true but temporary knowledge? In my case, I pushed myself perhaps deeper than was wise into deep, temporary knowledge.

Today we’ll focus specifically on cosmic exploration.\nChris Bache: There is a worldwide renaissance of research taking place in psychedelics. At the forefront of that research is therapeutic healing. That’s what’s bringing psychedelics back into the intellectual and clinical community—the capacity of these amplifying substances to bring forward the personal unconscious, unearth its wounds, and assist, deepen, and accelerate healing from trauma, PTSD, depression, and related issues. A second, overlapping use is promoting spiritual awakening—awakening to our deeper nature beneath the personality and deepening our experience of the wisdom, intelligence, and consciousness of the universe. That’s why I got started: to deepen my spiritual awakening. But the protocol I used was so strong and evocative that within a few years I was having experiences far beyond therapeutic healing or spiritual awakening. Over time, I came to understand I was engaged in cosmological exploration—a systematic attempt to explore the deep structure of spiritual reality, the consciousness of the universe itself. I’m not a clinician; I’m trained as a philosopher of religion. What interested me in Stan Grof’s early work was the capacity of these substances to lay bare not only personal issues but to enter into deep communion with the consciousness behind existence.",

Or is it that a critical mass does that and the effect rolls out to the rest of us?\nChris Bache:\nI don’t think it’s wise to hold the value that everybody should try psychedelics. Psychedelics are amplifiers of consciousness. What you do with those amplified states of awareness in those precious hours determines their value. You can use them recreationally—go to a concert, talk with friends—or you can use them to expose and heal your shadow and to move into deeper cosmological exploration. But many of us are carrying tensions within our psyche that should not be amplified. Carl Jung would listen to people’s dreams on their first day working with him, and he wouldn’t work with some people because he knew they were not ready for the depth of work that would emerge. I think this is true for psychedelics. There are some people who should—and a lot who should not—use psychedelics. Given their current patterns of consciousness, it’s too strong a medicine. They need a gentler, slower way in. Among people who are basically healthier—\n\nManda Scott:\nDo you know anyone who has a healthy psyche?\n\nChris Bache:\nI know some who have a healthier psyche.",

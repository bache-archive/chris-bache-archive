I believe that we all can, but whether we all should is another matter entirely. In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.\n\nIn LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves. What’s important is the vision of the cosmos they contain, and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point we’re coming to.",

I would be much gentler on myself if I were doing it over again, but at the time this is what I was doing to accelerate my own spiritual development.

Psychedelics in general, and LSD in particular, function as non-specific amplifiers and catalysts of consciousness. They don’t give you a particular experience; they hyper-amplify your consciousness. If you use those hours of hyper-amplified consciousness carefully—shutting out all outside stimulus and focusing entirely within—you can use them to explore and, in a sense, excavate the deep architecture of the psyche and the nature of consciousness itself.",

What’s important is the cosmology that emerges, the visions of reality that appear in psychedelic states. These can be valuable whether or not one ever touches these experiences.

Psychedelics can push the edges of those classic cosmologies and open new possibilities.\nFor instance, deep immersion in transtemporal experience is not so deeply embedded in mystical traditions, but it's been a big part of my psychedelic experience. Let me back up: I started in 1979 interested in spirituality and enlightenment. I'd been meditating for years, hit common early blocks, and thought sessions would help me break through to enlightenment faster. It didn't turn out that way. When I really dove in, I found a different track—a cosmic exploration to explore the consciousness of the universe, to experience the fabric of reality. It's not incompatible with the enlightenment track, but cosmic inquiry dominated my sessions. So, I wouldn't use the measure of enlightenment as the only way to evaluate what happened in those sessions. They're different projects. Only in recent years did it come back around to classic enlightenment.\n\nRick Archer: Plenty of yogis and siddhas have performed cosmic exploration and written down their findings; they've just gone about it through other means.

Psychedelics give us an opportunity to systematically and rigorously engage these questions.

I was twenty-nine years old, fresh out of graduate school, and looking for where to take my research now that my dissertation was finished. When I read Grof’s book, I immediately saw the relevance of his work to core questions I had been trained to ask as a philosopher, questions about whether life has meaning and purpose, whether human beings survive death, and whether there is a conscious intelligence operating in and through the universe. In that book, Stan distilled decades of clinical research involving hundreds of subjects and thousands of psychedelic sessions. In one reading, he convinced me that when LSD is taken in a therapeutically structured setting, it can be safely used to explore our consciousness with beneficial results. In addition, he suggested that in this setting we could come to know not only our own mind but also the mind of the universe itself. It was the latter claim that riveted my attention.

I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind.

If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.",

I’m not a therapist—though I received much healing in this work and am grateful for it. My primary intention, as a philosopher of religion, was to explore the universe as deeply as I could and understand not only my nature but the larger landscape.\n\nSimeon Mihaylov\nYou’ve said your experiences fit within the larger body of religious and philosophical traditions, which gave you confidence in their genuineness, yet they also pushed boundaries and took you into areas you hadn’t encountered elsewhere. Do psychedelics, then, offer the promise of genuinely new philosophical and spiritual insights? How do you see them fitting into the future development of philosophy and spirituality for our species?\n\nChris Bache\nThis is an exciting time and territory. I became convinced early on that psychedelics represent a true before-and-after moment in philosophical reflection. Philosophy, in one way or another, reflects on the breadth of human experience—our own and others’. Here we have an opportunity to temporarily deepen and widen awareness, pushing its boundaries.",

First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.\n\nWhat I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.",

        "text": "ally think is greatly under-focused. Where do you see psychedelics playing a role in this evolution?\nChris Bache: I understand the very strong emphasis in the psychedelic community on demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of psychedelics. It’s really important that we not blow this opportunity. We kind of blew it in the ’60s—it blew up in our faces. We lost the right to use these things and had to go underground. It’s important that with this new opportunity we document and demonstrate their effectiveness. Right now their effectiveness is being demonstrated in their therapeutic potential. But if we keep going, it’s only a matter of time before mainstream thinkers begin to understand why psychedelics are so therapeutically effective: because they open communion with the deeper dimensions of mind. In the early stages, this encounter with the deeper dimensions of our consciousness is very cleansing, very healing—therapeutically efficacious. That can be demonstrated. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We go deeper, and deeper. It opens our relationship to each other, to the planet, to other life forms. It opens our relationship to spiritual reality. I was trained as a philosopher of religion, and it’s always been the philosophical import of psychedelics that has interested me. I’m not a clinician or therapist. I’m interested in the philosophical and cosmological opportunities. From that perspective, we’re coming to a critical moment in history. It’s not enough just to heal us at this moment. We have to heal not simply the personal unconscious—though that’s very important—we have to heal the soul, the fundamental human condition. That means recovering an understanding of what we are, who we are, where we are, what existence is about. Psychedelics are being rediscovered in Western industrial cultures—indigenous cultures have had them a long time—where we’ve lost contact with the deeper levels of our own psyche, with the consciousness of the Earth, with the consciousness of the creator of galaxies. Psychedelics can awaken us quickly, jar us into awareness of this deeper dimension at exactly the time we need it. We can’t get through this period of history with the limited understanding of ourselves that grew out of 19th-century science—this materialist, mechanistic, reductionistic understanding—which is an absolutely devastating worldview to try to live in. That we come into existence by accident, it’s all random, there’s no meaning to it—no meaning to our individual challenges, no meaning to history. That worldview leads to the kind of planet we’ve developed, where we try to eat it all alive and get as much experience as we can because when we die it’s all over and was an exercise in futility anyway. Psychedelics help us understand that’s not true. It’s a very different agenda.",

Many people have written me since the book was published saying, “I understand what you’re talking about; I’ve had similar experiences, but I’ve never done psychedelics—I’m a lifelong meditator.” I think that’s absolutely true. If LSD is an amplifier of consciousness, it’s consciousness that does the work, and there are many ways to intensify and amplify consciousness. Psychedelics are simply another key to working with consciousness, but it’s consciousness that does the work.\n\nDaniel Pinchbeck\nSince you’ve had these insights into the future—though without an exact timeframe—if I remember in Dark Night, Early Dawn you wrote it would be a very compressed period when civilization began to crack apart and the emergent properties of the new human began to integrate. How would you ground that into practical advice for people now? Are psychedelic or entheogenic explorations a way to prepare for what’s coming? Is there a way to minimize the destructive impacts?

They’re very valuable substances, and fortunately we are reclaiming them after a 40-year interruption. These are amplifiers of consciousness. Everything hinges on how we use those hours of amplification. If we use them carefully and wisely, these substances can help heal the wounds of life.

The ways in which psychedelics have come back into our culture—both from Central and South American cultures that have kept traditions alive, and through the new psychedelics. LSD is often compared to the atom bomb; they were discovered at the same time. It’s an exponential opportunity to explore dimensions of consciousness that previous generations, for the most part, had to spend lifetimes meditating just to access. Now people of even modest spiritual capacities can have temporary experiences of these realities, which require a profound redrafting of our existential assumptions about how life works.",

As we develop our potentials and make this turning point—as we mature as a species—what kind of human being are we becoming? What are the potentials we are activating? I think it’s far beyond what we see even in science fiction. I want to build up to that by pivoting more directly to psychedelics.\n\nThis is something both Duane and I share, and I suspect a high percentage of people in this room have used psychedelics responsibly as part of their personal history or spiritual practice, just as many do yoga or meditation. Psychedelics are part of the arsenal not only of spiritual healing—healing the soul—but of becoming more aware of what our lives are about and what life itself is about.",

In therapeutically or spiritually focused psychedelic sessions, you speed up what happens in life at a slower pace. In reincarnation, we grow and evolve: die, return to soul consciousness; are born, contract into egoic consciousness; die, return to soul consciousness—again and again. We choose lives that challenge, stretch, and heal us, develop new talents, deepen capacities.\n\nPsychedelic therapy accelerates that process. Long, sustained meditation retreats do too. You bite off larger pieces of personal karma. But then something else takes over. It’s not about your personal enlightenment anymore. Your ties to the human family, the family of life, the universe deepen. You begin to feel engaged in a profound life process.",

I taught psychology of religion, transpersonal studies, and comparative mysticism. I initially thought these sessions would help me break through obstacles in my contemplative practice. What I found was a protocol of spiritual exploration that took me deeper than I imagined possible. After a couple of years, I developed an aptitude for working in these states. I never stopped meditating—I always meditated, did yoga, and various practices. In fact, the deeper you want to go with psychedelics, the more important a daily spiritual practice becomes to anchor and absorb what you unleash. Psychedelics gave me access to states you can reach with meditation, but typically only with many lifetimes of practice. I differentiate between the path of temporary immersion—working with psychedelics, immersed for hours at a time—and the path of presence—contemplative presence—which is slower but tends to produce abiding transparency. They’re complementary approaches, but different.",

        "text": "ing.\nIain McNay:\nSo is the transformation happening within the trip, or after you come back—or both?\nChris Bache:\nIt’s both. And I want to say this—there’s a lot of discussion about psychedelics and enlightenment: do psychedelics lead to enlightenment? Are they counterproductive or productive? These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.",

    <h2>Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)</h2>
    <div class="stack">
      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §8 ¶7</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. […] It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §3 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. […] We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §1 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using a protocol that combines protected isolation, interior focus, and deeply evocative music drives the psychedelic state far beyond what one is likely to experience if one takes LSD in a recreational setting. […] They will tend to be shallower, less cathartic, and less revelatory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §7 ¶2</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. […] Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring […]. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]heir minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. […] [E]arly sessions […] functioned as an intensive training camp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §2 ¶5</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>By moving systematically back and forth between psychedelically amplified states of consciousness and our ordinary consciousness […] With psychedelics we are entering a new era in philosophy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Optional context (use sparingly if needed):</em><br />
<strong>LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶13</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. […] They hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. […] LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation […] that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind.</p>

<p>So you began with the motivation to explore the universe as a philosopher?<br />
<strong>Chris Bache</strong><br />
Correct. I’m not a therapist—though I received much healing in this work and am grateful for it. My primary intention, as a philosopher of religion, was to explore the universe as deeply as I could […].<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Kh5aqAuDBIM?t=1105">00:18:25</a> — <em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe – S2S Podcast</em> (2023-01-06) • 00:18:25</p>
<p>In therapeutically or spiritually focused psychedelic sessions, you speed up what happens in life at a slower pace. […] Psychedelic therapy accelerates that process. […] In fact, the deeper you want to go with psychedelics, the more important a daily spiritual practice becomes to anchor and absorb what you unleash.<br />

<p>I differentiate between the path of temporary immersion […] and the path of presence—contemplative presence—which is slower but tends to produce abiding transparency. They’re complementary approaches, but different.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FMgixG6Z0sk?t=930">00:15:30</a> — <em>Psychedelics and the Cosmic Mind</em> (2025-03-18) • 00:15:30</p>
<p>If we use those hours carefully and conscientiously, they can accelerate our evolution. […] They act as strange attractors, drawing us into our individual and collective evolution faster and more deeply.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Dw7D7ih8vy0?t=5192">01:26:32</a> — <em>EP.6 - Chris Bache | LSD AND THE MIND OF THE UNIVERSE</em> (2020-05-13) • 01:26:32</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s wise to hold the value that everybody should try psychedelics. […] There are some people who should—and a lot who should not—use psychedelics. Given their current patterns of consciousness, it’s too strong a medicine.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/q-caGhIlKS8?t=3445">00:57:25</a> — <em>The Phoenix Always Rises: Evolving into the Future Human</em> (2025-01-08) • 00:57:25</p>
<p>These are amplifiers of consciousness. Everything hinges on how we use those hours of amplification. If we use them carefully and wisely, these substances can help heal […] and open up spiritual platforms.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/2Trb-vC8zc0?t=3085">00:51:25</a> — <em>LSD &amp; the Mind of the Universe (What Is Going OM)</em> (2023-08-17) • 00:51:25</p>
<p>Using psychedelics carefully […] is an exponential opportunity to explore dimensions of consciousness that previous generations […] spent lifetimes meditating to access.<br />

      <p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?</p>

<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶2 (1 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path that has been well documented by scholars. From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶7 (1 · 8)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶13 (10 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics and the reservations some teachers have about them as agents of spiritual transformation. And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances <em>when they are used therapeutically</em>, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §2 ¶5 (1 · 2)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By moving systematically back and forth between psychedelically amplified states of consciousness and our ordinary consciousness, where these experiences can be digested and evaluated, philosophical discourse is expanded and deepened. It is difficult to overstate the significance of this historic transition. With psychedelics we are entering a new era in philosophy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶21 (1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book <em>The Cosmic Game</em>. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §1 ¶4 (1 · 1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using a protocol that combines protected isolation, interior focus, and deeply evocative music drives the psychedelic state far beyond what one is likely to experience if one takes LSD in a recreational setting. I’m not disparaging tripping, for clearly many people have had life-changing experiences using psychedelics in this manner. I’m simply pointing out that staying in contact with the outside world will change the pattern of the experiences that emerge. They will tend to be shallower, less cathartic, and less revelatory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶1 (1 · 9)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I have thought about the extraordinary range of experiences that opened on my journey, the more I have come to appreciate the complex dynamics of psychedelic disclosure. In these states, we are using consciousness to explore consciousness, and a fascinating dance takes place between the mind doing the exploring and the larger mind being explored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §3 ¶1 (9 · 3)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For psychedelics to have their deepest impact on our culture, it is not sufficient for us to simply record the powerful experiences they unleash. We must also ground these experiences in critical discourse and place them in dialogue with other fields of learning where possible. For this reason, when I presented this session in <em>Dark Night, Early Dawn</em>, I unpacked its assertions about the role the collective psyche will play in humanity’s awakening as carefully and systematically as I could. These assertions are:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §5 ¶1 (10 · 5)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning of this book, I said that there were two basic trajectories in my psychedelic work. The first was spiritual awakening, and the second was cosmic exploration. While I never let go of personal liberation as my baseline objective, the work of collective liberation and the adventure of exploring the cosmos had come to dominate my sessions. Now in these late sessions, the arc of the work seemed to be curving back around to the original goal of spiritual awakening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §0 ¶2 (1 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this opening chapter, I want to candidly describe how I worked with LSD and share some core observations about the psychedelic process. Even as psychedelic research resumes, there is still a great deal of misinformation and mistrust of psychedelics in our culture. By putting my cards on the table up front, I hope to create as clear a field as possible for the story that follows. Readers who are not familiar with the psychedelic literature will get a solid understanding of how this method of inquiry works, while those who know this literature well will see how I have adapted and personalized it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶3 (2 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I begin the story of this journey, what is foremost in my mind is how many levels of consciousness I will be asking the reader to enter with me in the chapters ahead. In this respect, the story that follows is very different from some early influential accounts of psychedelic experience. Aldous Huxley wrote his beautiful book <em>The Doors of Perception</em> after only one mescaline trip, and he took psychedelics only ten times during his life. Similarly, when the great historian of religion Huston Smith published his collected reflections on psychedelics, <em>Cleansing the Doors of Perception</em>, he had taken LSD only a half dozen times. After that, he said, “The utility seemed to go down quickly and the bummers increased,” leading him to adopt Alan Watts’s advice: “When you get the message, hang up the phone.” This book is about what happens if you don’t hang up the phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶22 (1)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a <em>cosmic communion</em> to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.</p>

<p>Simeon Mihaylov
So you began with the motivation to explore the universe as a philosopher?
Chris Bache
Correct. I’m not a therapist—though I received much healing in this work and am grateful for it. My primary intention, as a philosopher of religion, was to explore the universe as deeply as I could and understand not only my nature but the larger landscape.</p>
<p>Simeon Mihaylov
You’ve said your experiences fit within the larger body of religious and philosophical traditions, which gave you confidence in their genuineness, yet they also pushed boundaries and took you into areas you hadn’t encountered elsewhere. Do psychedelics, then, offer the promise of genuinely new philosophical and spiritual insights? How do you see them fitting into the future development of philosophy and spirituality for our species?</p>
<p>Chris Bache
This is an exciting time and territory. I became convinced early on that psychedelics represent a true before-and-after moment in philosophical reflection. Philosophy, in one way or another, reflects on the breadth of human experience—our own and others’. Here we have an opportunity to temporarily deepen and widen awareness, pushing its boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>any insights on how psychedelics or raising consciousness might help us find a better path forward?
Chris Bache:
Let’s hold the second part and address the first, because this was one of the biggest surprises of my work. First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ally think is greatly under-focused. Where do you see psychedelics playing a role in this evolution?
Chris Bache: I understand the very strong emphasis in the psychedelic community on demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of psychedelics. It’s really important that we not blow this opportunity. We kind of blew it in the ’60s—it blew up in our faces. We lost the right to use these things and had to go underground. It’s important that with this new opportunity we document and demonstrate their effectiveness. Right now their effectiveness is being demonstrated in their therapeutic potential. But if we keep going, it’s only a matter of time before mainstream thinkers begin to understand why psychedelics are so therapeutically effective: because they open communion with the deeper dimensions of mind. In the early stages, this encounter with the deeper dimensions of our consciousness is very cleansing, very healing—therapeutically efficacious. That can be demonstrated. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We go deeper, and deeper. It opens our relationship to each other, to the planet, to other life forms. It opens our relationship to spiritual reality. I was trained as a philosopher of religion, and it’s always been the philosophical import of psychedelics that has interested me. I’m not a clinician or therapist. I’m interested in the philosophical and cosmological opportunities. From that perspective, we’re coming to a critical moment in history. It’s not enough just to heal us at this moment. We have to heal not simply the personal unconscious—though that’s very important—we have to heal the soul, the fundamental human condition. That means recovering an understanding of what we are, who we are, where we are, what existence is about. Psychedelics are being rediscovered in Western industrial cultures—indigenous cultures have had them a long time—where we’ve lost contact with the deeper levels of our own psyche, with the consciousness of the Earth, with the consciousness of the creator of galaxies. Psychedelics can awaken us quickly, jar us into awareness of this deeper dimension at exactly the time we need it. We can’t get through this period of history with the limited understanding of ourselves that grew out of 19th-century science—this materialist, mechanistic, reductionistic understanding—which is an absolutely devastating worldview to try to live in. That we come into existence by accident, it’s all random, there’s no meaning to it—no meaning to our individual challenges, no meaning to history. That worldview leads to the kind of planet we’ve developed, where we try to eat it all alive and get as much experience as we can because when we die it’s all over and was an exercise in futility anyway. Psychedelics help us understand that’s not true. It’s a very different agenda.</p>

<p>es of insight, integration, and deep time without the use of mind-altering drugs or plant medicines.
Chris Bache
Absolutely. Many people have written me since the book was published saying, “I understand what you’re talking about; I’ve had similar experiences, but I’ve never done psychedelics—I’m a lifelong meditator.” I think that’s absolutely true. If LSD is an amplifier of consciousness, it’s consciousness that does the work, and there are many ways to intensify and amplify consciousness. Psychedelics are simply another key to working with consciousness, but it’s consciousness that does the work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daniel Pinchbeck
Since you’ve had these insights into the future—though without an exact timeframe—if I remember in Dark Night, Early Dawn you wrote it would be a very compressed period when civilization began to crack apart and the emergent properties of the new human began to integrate. How would you ground that into practical advice for people now? Are psychedelic or entheogenic explorations a way to prepare for what’s coming? Is there a way to minimize the destructive impacts? It feels like there’s a destructive express train heading our way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ut that, but it’s an intriguing vision from a profound teacher about the potential we’re activating.
What’s important is to realize we’re just children waking up in a garden that’s been developing for billions of years. We’re only beginning to wake up to what’s going on, to who we are, to what’s happening. We’re like children in a playpen, but I think we’re about to get out of the playpen. We’re about to walk. We’re about to become mature adults.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sandy Sedgbeer:
You feel there is an urgent need to get psychedelics back on the table so their efficacy can be proven, and we can start adopting them to help people heal their wounds and, hopefully, evolve more quickly?</p>
<p>Chris Bache:
I think so. They’re very valuable substances, and fortunately we are reclaiming them after a 40-year interruption. These are amplifiers of consciousness. Everything hinges on how we use those hours of amplification. If we use them carefully and wisely, these substances can help heal the wounds of life. Deeper still, they can help us recover insights into our true nature—our fundamental core identity with all other life forms. They open up spiritual platforms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ould we best use psychedelics for spiritual awakening in light of the coming challenges we may face?
Chris Bache: I hope we use them for more than spiritual awakening. The whole movement in the psychedelic renaissance toward healing is really important. When I look at human beings, I don’t simply see human beings—I tend to see souls. When I look at children, I don’t see young beings; they could be very old beings in a young body. And when I see old people, I don’t necessarily see old beings; it could be a very young soul in an old body. I look at the qualities of soul present in an incarnation.</p>

Reid Robison:
Earlier you mentioned the role psychedelics might be playing in this evolution of consciousness. When we were talking about that place between blades of grass and chimpanzees, what are your thoughts on Terence McKenna's stoned ape hypothesis? Was that an example of the universe between spirit and matter learning as it evolved? Do you view psychedelics as playing a role in history as well?</p>

Terence's hypothesis is interesting. I don't have an opinion on it or any new insights to add. I hold it as an interesting hypothesis without any independent way of assessing it.</p>

<p>Joe Moore:
Do you see psychedelics aiding in this in any way?
Chris Bache:
Yeah, absolutely. The ways in which psychedelics have come back into our culture—both from Central and South American cultures that have kept traditions alive, and through the new psychedelics. LSD is often compared to the atom bomb; they were discovered at the same time. It’s an exponential opportunity to explore dimensions of consciousness that previous generations, for the most part, had to spend lifetimes meditating just to access. Now people of even modest spiritual capacities can have temporary experiences of these realities, which require a profound redrafting of our existential assumptions about how life works.</p>

Boy, do I want to jump on that. As we develop our potentials and make this turning point—as we mature as a species—what kind of human being are we becoming? What are the potentials we are activating? I think it’s far beyond what we see even in science fiction. I want to build up to that by pivoting more directly to psychedelics.</p>

<p>This is something both Duane and I share, and I suspect a high percentage of people in this room have used psychedelics responsibly as part of their personal history or spiritual practice, just as many do yoga or meditation. Psychedelics are part of the arsenal not only of spiritual healing—healing the soul—but of becoming more aware of what our lives are about and what life itself is about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you went through them in a fraction of that time. What kind of effect does that have on someone?
Chris Bache: I want to be careful. In therapeutically or spiritually focused psychedelic sessions, you speed up what happens in life at a slower pace. In reincarnation, we grow and evolve: die, return to soul consciousness; are born, contract into egoic consciousness; die, return to soul consciousness—again and again. We choose lives that challenge, stretch, and heal us, develop new talents, deepen capacities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psychedelic therapy accelerates that process. Long, sustained meditation retreats do too. You bite off larger pieces of personal karma. But then something else takes over. It’s not about your personal enlightenment anymore. Your ties to the human family, the family of life, the universe deepen. You begin to feel engaged in a profound life process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>versus, for example, meditation or other spiritual practices that can lead deeper into these realms?
Chris Bache: I’d been meditating since college, in a couple traditions, and as a professor of religious studies I had a solid grounding in the world’s spiritual traditions. I taught psychology of religion, transpersonal studies, and comparative mysticism. I initially thought these sessions would help me break through obstacles in my contemplative practice. What I found was a protocol of spiritual exploration that took me deeper than I imagined possible. After a couple of years, I developed an aptitude for working in these states. I never stopped meditating—I always meditated, did yoga, and various practices. In fact, the deeper you want to go with psychedelics, the more important a daily spiritual practice becomes to anchor and absorb what you unleash. Psychedelics gave me access to states you can reach with meditation, but typically only with many lifetimes of practice. I differentiate between the path of temporary immersion—working with psychedelics, immersed for hours at a time—and the path of presence—contemplative presence—which is slower but tends to produce abiding transparency. They’re complementary approaches, but different.</p>

<p>ing.
Iain McNay:
So is the transformation happening within the trip, or after you come back—or both?
Chris Bache:
It’s both. And I want to say this—there’s a lot of discussion about psychedelics and enlightenment: do psychedelics lead to enlightenment? Are they counterproductive or productive? These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.</p>

<p>t and matter, learning as it evolved? Do you view psychedelics as playing a role in history as well?
Chris Bache
Terence’s hypothesis is interesting, but I don't have an opinion or any new insights to add. I hold it as an interesting hypothesis without an independent way of assessing it. I do think we are at a turning point in history—a make-or-break point—and psychedelics have a significant role to play. They give us extra awareness when we desperately need it, and a form of accelerated, deep healing when we desperately need that. There is a tremendous inner fermentation and detoxification happening at the collective as well as individual level. It manifests in our individual lives as an up-rushing of karmic content, conditioning, pain, and trauma we’ve been carrying in our soul history. This is happening not just to a few middle-class individuals who can attend to it, but underneath our social movements and the world at large. Psychedelics, by amplifying consciousness—our own and the consciousness we are part of—help us heal and manage this purification process, and they widen our worldview. One good deep experience of communion with the deep structure of the universe can shatter materialism—the philosophy that matter is the only thing that's real. I think Huston Smith was right: a mystical experience does not a mystic make, but a mystical experience can an atheist unmake. How far will this go? How deep will psychedelic healing reach in our culture? How fast will insights realized under psychedelic communion contribute to the paradigm shift, which is being driven by multiple disciplines right now? I don't know. But the fact that LSD was invented in the same decade as the nuclear bomb, and the nuclear bomb changed the global order, may be a significant synchronicity.</p>

<p>this story? Maybe we can start with psychedelics—how did psychedelics come on your radar initially?
Chris Bache
I had just finished graduate school, was publishing a few articles out of my dissertation, and looking for where to take my research. I was a brand-new university professor when I met the work of Stanislav Grof, and that snapped my head to attention. I did not have a psychedelic history. I finished graduate school in religious studies as a pretty deeply convinced, atheistically inclined agnostic. But I read Stan’s work and a light bulb went off. I said, this is important—not just to psychology, but to philosophy of religion, which was my training. I wanted to get involved, but it had been made illegal. So I split my life. In my day job, I functioned as a professor of religious studies, teaching conventional or semi-conventional courses. And I began what eventually became a 20-year journey working with LSD, following Stan’s paradigm and then pushing the limits of that paradigm much farther than I appreciated at the time. Trained in philosophy of religion, I kept careful records and notes, trying to make the engagement as clean and productive as possible. I knew there would come a time to share the insights with a broader audience. After I retired from the university, that time finally came.</p>

<p>stain them? You’ve said you have different answers at different times. What’s your answer right now?
Chris Bache:
If we do this work not simply to generate temporary highs or insights but to facilitate a maturation of our psycho-spiritual life that leads to an abiding shift—less about peak experiences and more about plateau experiences—then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. We enter these states for only a few hours, and then we come out and reconcile ourselves to the limitations of the practice. But if we use those hours carefully and conscientiously, they can accelerate our evolution. By showing us where we’re going, they act as strange attractors, drawing us into our individual and collective evolution faster and more deeply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is frustrating to be so deeply immersed in the wisdom of the universe at two in the afternoon and by ten that night feel your ordinary mind congeal around itself again. What is the value of true but temporary knowledge? In my case, I pushed myself perhaps deeper than was wise into deep, temporary knowledge. If I were doing it over, I’d be more patient with a slower pace of personal evolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>r current perspective and the teachings we’ve received from the past—perhaps Buddhism in particular?
Chris Bache:
Once again, I want to emphasize that the work I did is a path of temporary immersion. Temporary immersion does not easily or conventionally lead to permanent shifts in awareness. You have to do a lot of spiritual practice before what we experience in an amplified psychedelic state can become our ordinary consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The great masters of the spiritual traditions, and of Buddhism in particular, have always been my heroes. Their teachings have been my guiding light for how to engage psychedelic states responsibly, and how to invest in them in ways that can be converted into long-term transformations of one’s baseline consciousness. Truly, all honor to the great beings of these traditions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sychedelics out there and why people use them? Today we’ll focus specifically on cosmic exploration.
Chris Bache: There is a worldwide renaissance of research taking place in psychedelics. At the forefront of that research is therapeutic healing. That’s what’s bringing psychedelics back into the intellectual and clinical community—the capacity of these amplifying substances to bring forward the personal unconscious, unearth its wounds, and assist, deepen, and accelerate healing from trauma, PTSD, depression, and related issues. A second, overlapping use is promoting spiritual awakening—awakening to our deeper nature beneath the personality and deepening our experience of the wisdom, intelligence, and consciousness of the universe. That’s why I got started: to deepen my spiritual awakening. But the protocol I used was so strong and evocative that within a few years I was having experiences far beyond therapeutic healing or spiritual awakening. Over time, I came to understand I was engaged in cosmological exploration—a systematic attempt to explore the deep structure of spiritual reality, the consciousness of the universe itself. I’m not a clinician; I’m trained as a philosopher of religion. What interested me in Stan Grof’s early work was the capacity of these substances to lay bare not only personal issues but to enter into deep communion with the consciousness behind existence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>re psychedelics? Or is it that a critical mass does that and the effect rolls out to the rest of us?
Chris Bache:
I don’t think it’s wise to hold the value that everybody should try psychedelics. Psychedelics are amplifiers of consciousness. What you do with those amplified states of awareness in those precious hours determines their value. You can use them recreationally—go to a concert, talk with friends—or you can use them to expose and heal your shadow and to move into deeper cosmological exploration. But many of us are carrying tensions within our psyche that should not be amplified. Carl Jung would listen to people’s dreams on their first day working with him, and he wouldn’t work with some people because he knew they were not ready for the depth of work that would emerge. I think this is true for psychedelics. There are some people who should—and a lot who should not—use psychedelics. Given their current patterns of consciousness, it’s too strong a medicine. They need a gentler, slower way in. Among people who are basically healthier—</p>

<p>s extraordinary quest. And what was the nature of what you actually did to induce these experiences?
Chris Bache:
All my life, I’ve had a deep passion to understand our universe. I was in the seminary starting in high school, training to be a Catholic priest. I left that, got a degree in theology from Notre Dame, then studied at Cambridge and Brown, finishing at Brown in philosophy of religion—by then an absolutely convinced agnostic with strong atheistic inclinations. But the passion to understand what’s real—why there’s so much suffering in the world, whether there’s an intelligence in existence—was still pushing me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had finished my dissertation and was looking for where to go next when I encountered Stan Grof’s book Realms of the Human Unconscious. That extraordinary book turned my life around. In one reading he convinced me that LSD—or psychedelics—could be used safely, with proper precautions, to explore the deep structure of consciousness. Some of his anecdotes also suggested that one could reach beyond the personal unconscious to deeper fabrics of consciousness. I quickly realized the philosophical significance—not just the psychological significance—of his work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>does your work map onto Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s vision of the noosphere and this epochal birth?
Chris Bache:
The overlap is striking. He saw humanity coming to a turning point and articulated the noosphere. Trained as a geologist, he held a vast historical landscape alongside deep natural spirituality and Christian faith. I read Chardin and many others in graduate school. They didn’t shape what actually happened in my sessions, but they helped me understand and interpret it. The sessions had their own generative power, drawing from a different source. That Chardin saw so much on his own, non-amplified—just awesome.</p>

Another from the audience: What might be accelerating shifts in consciousness now? Are psychedelics part of that? How do we stabilize these shifts? If you had a workshop, what would you train people to do?</p>

      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶14</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though I did not pay it much attention at the time, it feels perhaps significant to me now that Vajrayana practice entered my life on the same day that the Diamond Luminosity opened for the first time. […] Vajrayana practice worked well with my psychedelic practice, both in opening the psychedelic window and in reinforcing the result. Vajrayana means the “Diamond Way,” and it was in the <em>sutras</em> (scriptures) and <em>termas</em> (hidden teachings) of Tibet that I found the clearest exposition of the Diamond Luminosity I had entered. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.10 §3 ¶13</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics […] I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances <em>when they are used therapeutically</em>, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind. […] I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §2 ¶12</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Purification is one of those “pay me now or pay me later” things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro […] foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. […] If one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to do in an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.2 §0 ¶5</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness […] Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §3 ¶2</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path […] these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. […] a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.</p>

<p>One gift of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation for the power and effectiveness of classic contemplative practices, including Vajrayana. […] Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence.<br />

<p>In the last five years of my work […] I entered Vajrayana Buddhism. […] When I began doing ancient practices—Chöd and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. […] It was very helpful.<br />

<p>The longer I worked with psychedelics, the more I appreciated the importance of a daily spiritual practice. […] Each step into deeper consciousness is a step into higher energy. To stabilize at that level, you have to acclimate to that energy, which requires intense purification processes.<br />

<p>Your mention of Padmasambhava gives me an opportunity to emphasize […] the path I was on is not the contemplative path. It’s a path of temporary immersion. […] We can talk about unpacking their spiritual potential, but it’s not the same as […] sustained contemplation.<br />

<p>In the Tibetan tradition, a practice is given in three levels. First, the mechanics. Second, the meaning. Third—and most important—the transmission of <em>lung</em>, the seed energy of the practice. […] You receive a seed from a teacher […] and you water and nourish it in yours.<br />

<p>I did intense Vajrayana practice for a number of years, and I’ve modified it from my psychedelic experiences. […] I’ve developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.<br />

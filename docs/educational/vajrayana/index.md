> Though I did not pay it much attention at the time, it feels perhaps significant to me now that Vajrayana practice entered my life on the same day that the Diamond Luminosity opened for the first time. I don’t think that Chöd, or Buddhism for that matter, steered my experience in this direction. I think that the trajectory that took me into the Diamond Luminosity was established in the years that led up to this breakthrough. Even so, it was a blessing when these two came together in my life. Vajrayana practice worked well with my psychedelic practice, both in opening the psychedelic window and in reinforcing the result. Vajrayana means the “Diamond Way,” and it was in the *sutras* (scriptures) and *termas* (hidden teachings) of Tibet that I found the clearest exposition of the Diamond Luminosity I had entered. I know that light is discussed in many spiritual traditions, and I’m sure I could find parallels between my experience of this light and their teachings, but it was my karma to find what I needed in Vajrayana, and I am grateful to Carol for bringing me into this lineage.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶7**

> So it was that during the last five years of my psychedelic journey, when the work was entering its most intense phase, I integrated Vajrayana practice into my psychedelic practice. I had always been a meditator, but this represented a more formal commitment to a specific lineage of dharma transmission. I was comfortable with most of Buddhist thought—not the patriarchy—and many of its teachings had been confirmed in my sessions. Vajrayana Buddhism is sometimes described as a synthesis of the sage tradition of Indian Buddhism and the shamanic Bon tradition indigenous to Tibet. Shamanism, therefore, is built into its very fabric. Perhaps this is why combining Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice always felt natural to me.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §2 ¶2**

> I stopped my sessions, first, because I was experiencing a chronic pain in my subtle energy system. There was so much energy moving through me in the weeks and months following each session that I was always uncomfortable. The Vajrayana practices had helped, but even they could not keep up with the increased flow of energy entering me in these last years. Despite all the precautions I had taken, despite all the yoga and meditation, and despite the purifications that had taken place inside the sessions themselves, this problem wasn’t going away. It was getting worse.

> This eruption of *bhaktian* devotion caught me by surprise because it was completely different from my usual approach to spirituality, which has always been more mental in character. Of the four spiritual paths in Hinduism—*jnana* (knowledge), *karma* (service), *raja* (meditation), and *bhakti* (devotion)—*bhakti* is the path I have least identified with, and yet here it was.

> I have used the language of Buddhism to frame the experience of Diamond Luminosity, and I will continue to do so for this last session as well. The term Buddhists use for the Pure Awareness that is one’s Essential Nature is “Nature of Mind,” what some religious traditions would call one’s Divine Nature.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶12**

> Purification is one of those “pay me now or pay me later” things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.

> This chapter tells the story of what happened in these four sessions. It is the story of entering the Diamond Light and of the intense purification that took place as this Diamond Light began to work its way more deeply into my physical being. The first two of these sessions focused on entering the Diamond Luminosity at successively deeper levels, the second two on absorbing the Diamond Luminosity into my mind and body. Into this narrative, I will weave two other pieces. The first is a set of new insights into the psychedelic process that emerged at this time. The second is the story of how I came to integrate Vajrayana Buddhist practice into my psychedelic practice and why.

> In Hinduism, Saccidananda is the name given the experience of ultimate reality. The word is composed of three roots that communicate the essence of the experience: Sat-chit-ananda—infinite being, infinite awareness, and infinite bliss. In Buddhism, the Buddha Womb refers to the infinite source of all existence. As Anne Klein describes it in her book Meeting the Great Bliss Queen, the Buddha Womb is the infinite expanse from which all existence arises. She quotes the great eighth-century Tibetan sage Padmasambhava who said:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §0 ¶2**

> The Diamond Light that exploded from my chest in session 38 was the forerunner of what emerged in full splendor now. After going through yet one more intense cycle of death and rebirth, I was taken into a brilliantly clear, supremely luminous radiance. Buddhism calls this radiance *dharmakaya*—the Clear Light of Absolute Reality. I call it the domain of Diamond Luminosity. This Luminosity captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest in continuing to explore the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me. This was a different order of reality altogether. Its clarity was so overwhelming, its energy so pure that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶38**

> In chapter 1, I criticized the up-and-out cosmologies of the religions of the Axial Age, which place the final goal of life in some off-planet heavenly paradise. Among these traditions, the Asian religions have taught that reincarnation culminates in a spiritual awakening that frees us from the cycle of rebirth and physical existence. In Hinduism, this awakening is called *moksha*, “escape,” for through it one escapes samsara and returns to Brahman. In Buddhism, *nirvana* (enlightenment with a body) is followed at death by the higher state of *parinirvana* (final enlightenment without a body). Even the Bodhisattvas who commit themselves out of compassion to returning to Earth after their enlightenment are ultimately seeking to liberate all sentient beings into parinirvana, thus emptying the planet.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶35**

> The vision of reincarnation that emerged in the 38th session is different from the classical Eastern view. The setting for this teaching was carefully constructed. The first cycle of death and rebirth had brought me into a paradise so unspeakably beautiful that it instantly extinguished all my leftover earthly desires. This was a richer heaven than any I had ever imagined. If I had to speculate, I would guess that I had entered what Buddhists call a “deity realm,” a level of postmortem existence at the outer edges of the bardo. I cannot imagine anything less doing justice to the ecstasy I felt there. I would have been completely happy to stay where I was, but this was to be a teaching session. After a short period of time in this paradise, I was taken even deeper into spiritual reality, *“beyond the bardo echoes of physical existence.”* From this position outside *samsara* (cyclic existence), in the still and quiet of transcendence, the teaching described in the account unfolded.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §5 ¶16**

> After many cycles of cleansing and struggle, my teacher, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, suddenly appeared. I saw his face and felt his presence strongly. Then without anything being said, he introduced me to the Nature of Mind. Instantly and without transition of any kind, my mind opened into pure, boundless clarity. Absolutely without content, it was both the context and the content of all thoughts and sensations.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §11 ¶4**

> The in-taking of sacred awareness and the activation and stabilization of our innate capacities is the long and patient work of reincarnation, and I believe it is the long work of psychedelic practice as well, at least after the early excitement of discovery passes. In our later sessions, we are no longer running to explore a universe “out there,” but rather are “calling down heaven,” pulling higher states of awareness into our physical being, alchemically mixing heaven and earth in the vessel of our human body. When *nirvana* (enlightenment) and *samsara* (cyclic existence) are truly one, when full transparency lives in the sea of perpetual change, then heaven is realized on earth and there is no felt need to go elsewhere.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §11 ¶1**

> The visionary story I am telling in this book is not a story of escape into transcendence but one of deepening sacred presence on Earth. This may not be apparent in the early and middle stages of the story, but it will become clear by its end. I mention this because the classical religions of the Axial Age are at their core teachings of ascent, and this archetype runs deep in our culture. Both Western and Asian religions affirm stories of an “up-and-out” salvation that place the final goal of life in some off-planet spiritual paradise, be it the Christian Heaven, the Islamic Garden, or the Buddhist Pure Land. Even the Buddhist Bodhisattvas who pledge to keep returning to Earth to liberate all sentient beings are trying to liberate them into *parinirvana*, “final enlightenment” or enlightenment without a body.

> back and forth between the pain and transpersonal horizons several times before finally settling into a clear, spacious state. As I did, an interactive arena of dialogue with a Council of Elders opened around me. The music was the deep guttural chanting of the Tibetan monks of the Gyuto monastery. The head monk's powerful bass voice grabbed me and held me fast, completely stopping my thought process. A voice said, “Stop everything and pay attention! Pay attention and learn!” Class had resumed.

> developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.
For example, in classic Vajrayana we distinguish between the Samaya Safa and the Jnana sattva. The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa. The living memory of the diamond luminosity is, for me, a more effective spiritual vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.

> essions I was given many practices—told, “Do this, do that”—and I took those into my daily practice.
In the last five years of my work, as I discuss in the Diamond Luminosity chapter, I entered Vajrayana Buddhism. I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.

Chris Bache
One gift of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation for the power and effectiveness of classic contemplative practices, including Vajrayana. By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.

I also have a sense—because I’ve “died” so many times and gone where I will go when I die physically—that I feel very comfortable with that domain. We’re told over and over that we practice to prepare for the moment of death because it has great potential for accelerating our evolution. I agree. My psychedelic practice has been done in a way to prepare me for the moment of death. The result is that I feel comfortable with death and with navigating what comes after, because I feel I’ve already encountered it in many ways.

> s out of the joy of this profound reality that is living us. So yes—it’s just purifying. That’s all.
Andrew Holecek
This resonates deeply—acknowledging the hubris of saying “my path betokens the truth, therefore yours is true because it relates to mine.” But with that caveat, there are many resonances, especially the notion of purification. As we start to close for today, one section that really spoke to me was your interjection of the Vajrayana path, and how it might create a holding environment to support, augment, and transition—more organic, phenomenological means versus purely neurological ones. For people listening who want something to take home: what has been, and continues to be, the role of meditation and Vajrayana in augmenting, supporting, enhancing, stabilizing what you’ve gone through?

> ferently, where causal-level reality is a different physics, a different landscape of consciousness.
When you open to these depths and then return to ordinary consciousness, it’s really important to have a daily practice to anchor you, to keep your feet on the ground. The skills cultivated in Vipassana or zazen—observation and non-attachment—are precisely the skills you use in a psychedelic session, so they reinforce each other. Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.

In the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a ChÃ¶d practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions. I immediately learned that practice and began doing it before any session. I would never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.

> never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.
Working at very high energetic levels sometimes set in motion processes difficult to integrate in my subtle energy system. If you know Alex Grey’s depictions of powerful energies triggered in deep psychedelic work, you’ll recognize how, after a session, your system can feel achy and stretched. Vajrayana practices—Guru Yoga or deity yoga—gave that energy a place to run when I was back in ordinary consciousness and body. So for clarifying cognitive content, practicing teachings given in sessions, and managing the energetic consequences, a daily spiritual practice is really important.

> u’ve used Dharmakaya. Are there other Tibetan or Buddhist terms that relate to what you experienced?
Chris Bache:
Yes. Clear light mind, to me, is closer to the nature of mind in this context. I’m still digesting the differences between Diamond Luminosity as an extra-samsaric reality and Diamond Luminosity as the foundation of nirmanakaya existence. There are many correlations, and all honor to the great beings who have explored these dimensions more deeply than I’ve been able to—always a humble student of the great teachers. I put names as best I can to clarify, but it’s tricky—naming can shrink-wrap and stop the mystery, letting the mind back in where it doesn’t belong. So let me step into a little different framework.

> ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?
Chris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.

> fferent names. We can feel it in our bones: Maitreya, that higher realization working its way to us.
Andrew Holecek:
That’s exquisite. And I wonder if “growing down” might be a more appropriate embodied aspect—because “growing up” can sound like moksha, escapist, FedEx my consciousness to a pure land. It’s really waking down into the majesty—integrating your work, metabolizing, digesting, incorporating—literally bringing into soma this vast realization.

> undation. I believe we are on the threshold of becoming a species of Buddhas, Christs, and prophets.
After the benediction of blessings, I felt completely fulfilled. The universe had asked something of me, and in offering it up, I was rewarded with more joy than I could have ever imagined—a philosopher’s dream come true. I had known God, the fertile void, and profound joy. Little did I know I still had five years to go in this journey. After one more cycle of death and rebirth, I entered an extraordinarily clear state of consciousness—which I came to call diamond luminosity. This is what Buddhists refer to as Dharmakaya, the absolute clear light of being. Though I had encountered light in many subtle dimensions before, diamond light is of a different order entirely—ultra-clear, super-luminous, beyond imagination.

[00:35:34](https://youtu.be/O4ui6I1Wo9c?t=2134)  — *Diamonds from Heaven – Lecture at TimeWaver Summer World 2018* (2018-08-30) • 00:35:34

> sociated with the concept of Dharmakaya—the fundamental reality that is the source of all existence.
Let me back up: light entered my experiences in many forms and levels—many gradations. I'd experienced light many times in earlier death-rebirth processes. When I talk about the diamond light, it isn't just a metaphor: I'm describing an exceptionally clear and intense awareness, a crystalline light that eventually becomes transparent to itself. In those last five years—the last 26 sessions, about a third of all my work—I entered that reality four times, about once a year. Each time involved more detoxification, and about a year later, I'd re-enter that reality. That’s the kind of larger overview.

> art expansion, a deep opening of the mind, an awakening of compassion—the birth of the diamond soul.
I was 15 years into my journey, blessed beyond imagining, asked to give something in the ocean of suffering work, and rewarded with more blessings than I could count. Still, five years remained. I went through yet another death-and-rebirth and entered what I call the domain of diamond luminosity—a reality exceptionally clear. It was light, but a particular quality. I’d known light many times—people often experience great light at ego death—but the diamond light isn’t a metaphor. It’s a particular quality: exceptionally pure, so clear it takes your breath away. I think Buddhism calls this Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.

Over the next four years and 26 sessions—about a third of all my sessions—I only entered this reality four times. In between, more purification, more teaching, more absorbing lessons. The first two sessions took me deeper into diamond luminosity; then there was a pivot. In the last two, the diamond luminosity was crunching itself deeper into my mind, personality, physiology, biochemistry.

> t beyond any category of individuality I’d known. I came to call this the birth of the diamond soul.
I was given teachings reframing the goal of reincarnation. Much inherited teaching arose in cultures where the pattern was: we’re mired in illusion, we grow slowly through incarnations, eventually awaken to our divine nature, and then leave time and space—moksha, escape. Many cosmologies of the last few millennia are “up and out”: salvation, realization, and departure to an off-planet paradise. I think that’s incomplete—representing a developmental stage, not the end.

> to the primal void, the Buddha womb, Satchitananda, the fertile void beneath all manifest existence.
Another session, which I titled "Jesus' Blood," was an overwhelming experience of cosmic love. It's being drenched in a love so deep you realize you've never truly been loved until you've been loved like God loves—a force far deeper than anything I had encountered before. Another pivotal experience was the "birth of the diamond soul." Eleven years prior, I had an experience of my life as a completed whole, from start to finish, but in my fortieth session, I began to sense the integration of all my former lives. It was as if all my previous incarnations were winding together, like a string of white light around a kite spool. When this collective memory hit a critical mass, it exploded, fusing all those individual lives into one, and my consciousness soared beyond any sense of individual existence. I experienced what I call diamond luminosity—my heart ruptured, and my awareness expanded dramatically. This was my first taste of the state where I believe reincarnation is taking us.

Roger Walsh
What a wonderful vision. Even as you recount it now, I can see you going into your experience, deeply touched decades later. It’s an exquisite example of how these experiences continue to incarnate in and as you. And you emphasized again that awakenings aren’t the end point; beyond them is integration—allowing the realization to incarnate through us. You pointed to diamond vision and its resonance with Tibetan Buddhism. Interestingly, Tibetan Buddhism speaks of a further stage—pure perception—where one’s perception is transformed so that this world is seen not as mundane materiality but as an expression of that diamond illumination, a pure land optimized for awakening. Your description of both the illumination and its effects mirrors what’s recognized and highly valued in certain traditions.

Let me quickly list the chapters: there’s a methodology chapter, and then, in terms of content, Crossing the Boundary of Birth and Death; The Ocean of Suffering; Deep Time and the Soul; Initiation into the Universe; The Greater Real of Archetypal Reality; A Benediction of Blessings; The Birth of the Future Human; Diamond Luminosity and Final Vision; and the last chapter, Coming Off the Mountain. It took me a year to write that last chapter, reflecting on what has been happening in my life in the 20 years after I stopped my psychedelic work. I’ll touch a few points in each chapter and then open it up for questions.

Chris Bache:
In my experience, working at high doses, every session breaks down into two phases: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. There’s the dark, hard, death-and-dying kind of phase, and then the ecstatic phase. In reference to this work, James’ excellent talk this morning about shadow work was on point. Working as I did in a non-therapeutic modality, one of the great gifts I learned from Stan Grof is to completely, absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far as it wants to take you.

Stepping back, all the religions of the last 5,000 years have been what I would call “up-and-out” cosmologies: you achieve salvation or awakening, and once you achieve that state, you leave. The Hindu word for enlightenment was moksha—escape—escaping time and space. I think those cosmologies got half the message, but lost half the message. They represent incomplete visions of history because they leave unanswered the question: What is the purpose of time and space? What is the purpose of this magnificent universe? It’s been called a veil of suffering, a place to get out of as quickly as we can to return to divine bliss. I understand that, given the historical period when we began to have experiential access to deep divine truths. Naturally we would feel drawn to being there, and if we could not realize those truths here, we would want to be there.

> sitely clear, beyond imagination. Buddhism calls it Dharmakaya, the absolute reality of clear light.
Over five years and 26 sessions, I was taken into this reality only four times. In between, there was tremendous purification. In these states, you dissolve into light, take on the qualities and boundlessness of light—you dissolve in the crystalline nature of the Divine. I don’t mean divine in any conventional or theistic sense, but I have no other vocabulary for it. In each of those four adventures going deeper, the divine began to come deeper into my body.

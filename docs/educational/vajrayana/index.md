> Though I did not pay it much attention at the time, it feels perhaps significant to me now that Vajrayana practice entered my life on the same day that the Diamond Luminosity opened for the first time. I don’t think that Chöd, or Buddhism for that matter, steered my experience in this direction. I think that the trajectory that took me into the Diamond Luminosity was established in the years that led up to this breakthrough. Even so, it was a blessing when these two came together in my life. Vajrayana practice worked well with my psychedelic practice, both in opening the psychedelic window and in reinforcing the result. Vajrayana means the “Diamond Way,” and it was in the *sutras* (scriptures) and *termas* (hidden teachings) of Tibet that I found the clearest exposition of the Diamond Luminosity I had entered. I know that light is discussed in many spiritual traditions, and I’m sure I could find parallels between my experience of this light and their teachings, but it was my karma to find what I needed in Vajrayana, and I am grateful to Carol for bringing me into this lineage.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §3 ¶7**

> So it was that during the last five years of my psychedelic journey, when the work was entering its most intense phase, I integrated Vajrayana practice into my psychedelic practice. I had always been a meditator, but this represented a more formal commitment to a specific lineage of dharma transmission. I was comfortable with most of Buddhist thought—not the patriarchy—and many of its teachings had been confirmed in my sessions. Vajrayana Buddhism is sometimes described as a synthesis of the sage tradition of Indian Buddhism and the shamanic Bon tradition indigenous to Tibet. Shamanism, therefore, is built into its very fabric. Perhaps this is why combining Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice always felt natural to me.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §2 ¶2**

> I stopped my sessions, first, because I was experiencing a chronic pain in my subtle energy system. There was so much energy moving through me in the weeks and months following each session that I was always uncomfortable. The Vajrayana practices had helped, but even they could not keep up with the increased flow of energy entering me in these last years. Despite all the precautions I had taken, despite all the yoga and meditation, and despite the purifications that had taken place inside the sessions themselves, this problem wasn’t going away. It was getting worse.

> This eruption of *bhaktian* devotion caught me by surprise because it was completely different from my usual approach to spirituality, which has always been more mental in character. Of the four spiritual paths in Hinduism—*jnana* (knowledge), *karma* (service), *raja* (meditation), and *bhakti* (devotion)—*bhakti* is the path I have least identified with, and yet here it was.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §5 ¶9**

> I have used the language of Buddhism to frame the experience of Diamond Luminosity, and I will continue to do so for this last session as well. The term Buddhists use for the Pure Awareness that is one’s Essential Nature is “Nature of Mind,” what some religious traditions would call one’s Divine Nature.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶12**

> Purification is one of those “pay me now or pay me later” things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §0 ¶23**

> Light manifesting as Matter,
> Dharmakaya manifesting as Nirmanakaya,
> Heaven giving birth to Earth continuously.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶14**

> This chapter tells the story of what happened in these four sessions. It is the story of entering the Diamond Light and of the intense purification that took place as this Diamond Light began to work its way more deeply into my physical being. The first two of these sessions focused on entering the Diamond Luminosity at successively deeper levels, the second two on absorbing the Diamond Luminosity into my mind and body. Into this narrative, I will weave two other pieces. The first is a set of new insights into the psychedelic process that emerged at this time. The second is the story of how I came to integrate Vajrayana Buddhist practice into my psychedelic practice and why.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §0 ¶57**

> In Hinduism, Saccidananda is the name given the experience of ultimate reality. The word is composed of three roots that communicate the essence of the experience: Sat-chit-ananda—infinite being, infinite awareness, and infinite bliss. In Buddhism, the Buddha Womb refers to the infinite source of all existence. As Anne Klein describes it in her book Meeting the Great Bliss Queen, the Buddha Womb is the infinite expanse from which all existence arises. She quotes the great eighth-century Tibetan sage Padmasambhava who said:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §0 ¶2**

> This was Saccidananda,
> Being–Consciousness–Bliss,
> the Fertile Void,
> Mother of All Things,

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶11**

> The Diamond Light that exploded from my chest in session 38 was the forerunner of what emerged in full splendor now. After going through yet one more intense cycle of death and rebirth, I was taken into a brilliantly clear, supremely luminous radiance. Buddhism calls this radiance *dharmakaya*—the Clear Light of Absolute Reality. I call it the domain of Diamond Luminosity. This Luminosity captivated me so completely that it extinguished any interest in continuing to explore the other levels of existence that had previously fascinated me. This was a different order of reality altogether. Its clarity was so overwhelming, its energy so pure that returning to it became my sole focus in future sessions.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶38**

> In chapter 1, I criticized the up-and-out cosmologies of the religions of the Axial Age, which place the final goal of life in some off-planet heavenly paradise. Among these traditions, the Asian religions have taught that reincarnation culminates in a spiritual awakening that frees us from the cycle of rebirth and physical existence. In Hinduism, this awakening is called *moksha*, “escape,” for through it one escapes samsara and returns to Brahman. In Buddhism, *nirvana* (enlightenment with a body) is followed at death by the higher state of *parinirvana* (final enlightenment without a body). Even the Bodhisattvas who commit themselves out of compassion to returning to Earth after their enlightenment are ultimately seeking to liberate all sentient beings into parinirvana, thus emptying the planet.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶35**

> The vision of reincarnation that emerged in the 38th session is different from the classical Eastern view. The setting for this teaching was carefully constructed. The first cycle of death and rebirth had brought me into a paradise so unspeakably beautiful that it instantly extinguished all my leftover earthly desires. This was a richer heaven than any I had ever imagined. If I had to speculate, I would guess that I had entered what Buddhists call a “deity realm,” a level of postmortem existence at the outer edges of the bardo. I cannot imagine anything less doing justice to the ecstasy I felt there. I would have been completely happy to stay where I was, but this was to be a teaching session. After a short period of time in this paradise, I was taken even deeper into spiritual reality, *“beyond the bardo echoes of physical existence.”* From this position outside *samsara* (cyclic existence), in the still and quiet of transcendence, the teaching described in the account unfolded.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §5 ¶16**

> After many cycles of cleansing and struggle, my teacher, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, suddenly appeared. I saw his face and felt his presence strongly. Then without anything being said, he introduced me to the Nature of Mind. Instantly and without transition of any kind, my mind opened into pure, boundless clarity. Absolutely without content, it was both the context and the content of all thoughts and sensations.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §11 ¶4**

> The in-taking of sacred awareness and the activation and stabilization of our innate capacities is the long and patient work of reincarnation, and I believe it is the long work of psychedelic practice as well, at least after the early excitement of discovery passes. In our later sessions, we are no longer running to explore a universe “out there,” but rather are “calling down heaven,” pulling higher states of awareness into our physical being, alchemically mixing heaven and earth in the vessel of our human body. When *nirvana* (enlightenment) and *samsara* (cyclic existence) are truly one, when full transparency lives in the sea of perpetual change, then heaven is realized on earth and there is no felt need to go elsewhere.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §1 ¶1**

> The Visions of Awakening are drawn from the following sessions:

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.11 §1 ¶2**

> I started the session with a memory of the Diamond Light of Pure Clarity. I felt how true it is that spending seconds in that pristine
>  state undoes countless centuries of wandering lost in samsara. It felt as though all my psychedelic sessions had been one long Ngondro
>  preparing me for entry into this reality. I recalled the many rigidities and fixations in me that had been broken down on this journey and
>  knew that there was no shortcutting the lengthy purification required for awakening.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §11 ¶1**

> The visionary story I am telling in this book is not a story of escape into transcendence but one of deepening sacred presence on Earth. This may not be apparent in the early and middle stages of the story, but it will become clear by its end. I mention this because the classical religions of the Axial Age are at their core teachings of ascent, and this archetype runs deep in our culture. Both Western and Asian religions affirm stories of an “up-and-out” salvation that place the final goal of life in some off-planet spiritual paradise, be it the Christian Heaven, the Islamic Garden, or the Buddhist Pure Land. Even the Buddhist Bodhisattvas who pledge to keep returning to Earth to liberate all sentient beings are trying to liberate them into *parinirvana*, “final enlightenment” or enlightenment without a body.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶57**

> back and forth between the pain and transpersonal horizons several times before finally settling into a clear, spacious state. As I did, an interactive arena of dialogue with a Council of Elders opened around me. The music was the deep guttural chanting of the Tibetan monks of the Gyuto monastery. The head monk's powerful bass voice grabbed me and held me fast, completely stopping my thought process. A voice said, “Stop everything and pay attention! Pay attention and learn!” Class had resumed.

> I understand the debate among Buddhist practitioners over psychedelics and the reservations some teachers have about them as agents of spiritual transformation. And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §8 ¶7 (1 · 8)**

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)**

> If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)**

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶2 (1 · 3)**

> From an historical perspective, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are a modern variation of an ancient spiritual path that has been well documented by scholars. From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶2 (1 · 9)**

> All psychedelic disclosure is interactive. Everything we see and learn in these visionary states is shaped in subtle ways by what we are at the moment of contact. This does not mean that the visions we experience are merely projections of our personal psyche, as though we were not experiencing something that truly exists in the cosmos. Rather, it means that all visionary encounter is participatory. Our being evokes the portion of the universe we experience in these states, and the more conditioning we have let go of when this communion takes place, the more open-ended and far-reaching are the experiences that present themselves.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)**

> LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §11 ¶4 (1 · 11)**

> The in-taking of sacred awareness and the activation and stabilization of our innate capacities is the long and patient work of reincarnation, and I believe it is the long work of psychedelic practice as well, at least after the early excitement of discovery passes.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶21 (1)**

> Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book *The Cosmic Game*. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶11 (1 · 12)**

> But there is also a second variable at work here, and that is the speed with which we tear these skins away, how impatient we are to know the universe at these depths. If we choose a form of transformational practice in which our conditioning is released slowly, the result is a series of smaller initiations spread over a longer period of time, perhaps even many lifetimes. By contrast, working with a psychedelic like LSD is an example of a transformational practice that triggers an accelerated purification process that gives us quicker access to these realities, but there is a price to be paid for this quicker access. The price is the intensification of the death-rebirth process.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶12 (2 · 2)**

> Purification is one of those “pay me now or pay me later” things. In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §0 ¶3 (10 · 0)**

> Light has always been recognized as a signature of the Divine. It is a universal constant in our spiritual traditions—a vast radiance fusing all knowledge, love, and power. Mystics attest to it; those who have nearly died attest to it. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that when our psychedelic journey takes us deep into the universe, the Light is waiting for us.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶22 (1)**

> Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a *cosmic communion* to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.

Tasshin Fogleman:
Yes, and certainly for myself, this comes from a place of deep respect. Buddhism is like my home in a certain way, and I appreciate your clarifications. You spoke earlier about your spiritual practice and the different traditions you’ve been exposed to. It seems like you found a home in Vajrayana Buddhism—is that right?

Chris Bache:
It is, and it’s a kind of modified Vajrayana. I did intense Vajrayana practice for a number of years, and I’ve modified it from my psychedelic experiences. It’s not that I’ve realized those states, but I have an understanding and experiential memory of those levels of reality. They live inside me as active memories. I’ve developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.

> Fogleman:
What do you think it was about Vajrayana Buddhism that attracted you and felt like a home?
Chris Bache:
It was my first wife, Carol—my sitter in my sessions and a clinical psychologist—who really brought me into Vajrayana. I was more interested in the Zen tradition. I wasn’t interested in all the bells, candles, incense, and fanfare that comes with Vajrayana. But she went there, and I followed her. Through her, I met teachers gathering at the Tara Mandala Buddhist retreat center—Lama sutra malayonis established the center in Colorado—and I began to study there and go into retreats with that lineage. I met their lineage of awakened beings, and they made a deep impression on me. If my karma had introduced me to the great awakened beings of the Zen lineage, I could have gone there just as easily. It was the opportunity to meet these beings and receive teachings that made a large impression.

Tasshin Fogleman:
Coming back to your explorations, you use the phrase “deep time.” Can you say what you mean by that?

Chris Bache
I’ve been deeply influenced by all the world’s religions. I began as a Christian and a Catholic—four years in seminary studying for the priesthood. I studied Hebrew and Greek for biblical work. I’ve learned so much from Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Native traditions. The two deepest, longest-lasting influences on me have been Christianity and Buddhism.

I think my journey affirms the deepest truths of Christianity and of all the world’s religions—Judaism’s Kabbalah, Hinduism, Buddhism—while also, in important ways, eclipsing the religions of the last several thousand years. The universe I was initiated into demanded levels of understanding beyond anything I had learned in those traditions. I had to become operational within a deeper metaphysics.

Emmy Vadnais:
A question from Megan Salar: you’ve mentioned the importance of meditation and work outside the psychedelic sessions. What does your daily practice look like, or what would you recommend?

Chris Bache:
The longer I worked with psychedelics, the more I appreciated the importance of a daily spiritual practice. Conscientious psychedelic work opens your system to a vast field of consciousness—deeper, larger—and to enormous flows of energy. Each step into deeper consciousness is a step into higher energy. To stabilize at that level, you have to acclimate to that energy, which requires intense purification processes—often like fire, solar flares, volcanic energy—transforming your being so you can live for hours at a time at very deep levels where the world works differently, where causal-level reality is a different physics, a different landscape of consciousness.

Your mention of Padmasambhava gives me an opportunity to emphasize that I’m grateful for the correlations between my experiences and those recorded by the great contemplatives. But the path I was on is not the contemplative path. It’s a path of temporary immersion. When I’m describing things, it always has to be understood that these are temporary experiences. We can talk about unpacking their spiritual potential, but it’s not the same as coming into these experiences via the “slow-bake” method of sustained contemplation. I want to keep apples and oranges separate, because many people think, “I’ve had a tremendous revelatory enlightenment experience,” and—well, good for you—but that’s a temporary experience.

> sing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.
Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?

Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.

No, I think the cosmology that came out of this work isn’t different from what you see in the great contemplative and spiritual traditions. All honor to the great masters who've done this through the power of their own daily practice—they were always my teachers and masters. What they describe and what I experienced seem to fit hand in glove; there's nothing new there. The only difference is the method—someone with modest spiritual capacity, if they have enough determination and courage to submit to the regimen, might have a temporary experience of these things. As Huston Smith said, “A mystical experience does not a mystic make”—you can’t use these experiences to maintain that consciousness permanently. It would be nice if you could, but by going back and forth, and doing the daily practices, hopefully more and more of it internalizes in your being and you grow.

Chris Bache
As I understand it, the reality I was taken into in those four sessions is outside the bardo—an extra-samsaric reality beyond time and space and what I call the echoes of time-space bardo reality. The first two times, I was taken deeper into it and had the encounter with what I call the absolute light, which showed me it’s an infinite progression. The next two times, the diamond luminosity began to crunch itself deeper into my physical being. I wasn’t going out; it was coming in—into my psyche and body. It felt like it was changing me at a cellular level. By the very end of my journey, my perception had changed—how I literally see things. Not permanently, but it gave me a temporary experience I call diamond vision. I was seeing a hundred, a thousand times more sharply and clearly than ever before. I realized I was seeing through the eyes of the future human—seeing in a way all humanity will one day see. All our senses—sight, touch, taste—are being elevated to higher levels the more consciousness we can internalize in our bodies.

Chris Bache:
First, what I’m going to describe is my variation on an ancient Buddhist teaching. When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.

Nick Mather:
When you speak, it reminds me of the Merkabah mysticism of Ezekiel, where you can’t describe the full vision of God, but you can talk about the throne or the hem of the robe—just a small portion of a grander vision.

Chris Bache:
I think so. I’ve spent more ink than most trying to describe these things, and even so, I still feel I’m just talking about the hem of the garment.

Nick Mather:
I want to dig deeper into the cosmology you reveal. One key element is reincarnation. You were deeply informed by Ian Stevenson at the University of Virginia. I agree his evidence is compelling, although he was cautious. But you have a somewhat different take than the traditional understanding. Could you speak to that, and how reincarnation fits into this cosmology?

The other tradition—to Kuhn Rinpoche said—sharing experiences inappropriately is like being in a dark cave with a candle and giving your candle away: you’re left in the dark; opportunity becomes obstacle. So this is both applause and an invitation for commentary in terms of encouraging more sharing so people can recognize a chorus of sanity emerging—radical, innovative ways of learning.

Chris Bache:
I had to face resistance around that too. In Buddhism, traditionally, you don’t talk about your experiences; it can become an encumbrance. But I’m a teacher. I love to teach. I was designed to teach—I’m a yacker. That’s what I love to do.

> n but a journey, cliché as that sounds. Did you go into the sessions with that in mind conceptually?
Chris Bache:
Conceptually, yes. But even the Eastern models I knew didn’t encapsulate the full scale of what opened in this journey. Yes, you can work through multiple layers of the bardo, the after-death states; you can go into extra-samsaric reality, spiritual dimensions beyond the bardo. But Buddhism, which was the tradition I was most at home with, tends to stop there and invoke the grand silence—when the Buddha was asked ultimate questions, he remained silent. I found realities opening at that dimension that were beyond that.

Jef Baker:
Grand silence is often correlated with ineffability, a word thrown around in the psychedelic world, especially with large doses. I remember you addressing that in the book.

I loved the book LSD and the Mind of the Universe, and thank you for sharing your insights tonight.” For those watching online, we’ll take questions from our Zoom audience. Here’s one: how does your process relate to Christology? Did you have Christ avatar experiences, and how does that map onto your journey?

Chris Bache:
Interesting question. Two traditions have had the largest influence on my life—Christianity and Buddhism. I also taught world religions for decades, and the lineages became passionate lovers for me; each taught me so much. While I started within a Christian framework, I came to see that Christ is the fruition of a spiritual impulse in the Middle East that parallels, in seminal ways, the fruition of similar impulses in India, Africa, South America. Larger patterns emerged.

Chris Bache:
…shared in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—infused with mind and soul. And, of course, now we know how vast the physical universe is, and the question becomes: how large is the mind of the universe? How deep is it?

I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.

> receive transmissions—not under LSD, but in ordinary life. Can you say more about that preparation?
Chris Bache: In the Tibetan tradition, a practice is given in three levels. First, the mechanics. Second, the meaning. Third—and most important—the transmission of lung, the seed energy of the practice. You receive a seed from a teacher who has matured the practice in their being, and you water and nourish it in yours.

That’s my context for transmission, and it applies in my psychedelic context. I was put through enormous purification to receive teachings from those levels of consciousness. If there’s a parallel between the cushion and the psychedelic session—and if we’re in a historical shift—then my intuition is that we’re experiencing a rise in divine influx. There’s more energy coming up underneath us, more information becoming available—not just physically via the internet, but from the center of our being. Teachings and insights are rising inside us, which we can catch, but to catch them we must prepare ourselves. We have to empty ourselves of what is small to receive pieces of what is large. Transmission is a larger category.

The ineffable enormity of it—there’s a dance between the mythopoetic aspect of my being, bathing in the artistry of what you shared, versus formulating references. On one level I hesitate to say anything—what can one say without watering it down? But with your understanding of Buddhist nomenclature—and the interesting synchronicity that when Diamond Luminosity was introduced to you, Vajrayana became part of your path—using that language is interesting. When you say these things, I find myself exploring my reference capacity to understand: “Oh, that sounds like Dharmadhatu.” But naming can shrink-wrap the enormity. Still, we can sit in silence or do our best with language. Would you resonate—with your understanding of the Buddhist tradition—with descriptions of analogous states like clear light mind? You’ve used Dharmakaya. Are there other Tibetan or Buddhist terms that relate to what you experienced?

> developed forms of Vajrayana practice by integrating those memories into the realization protocols.
For example, in classic Vajrayana we distinguish between the Samaya Safa and the Jnana sattva. The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa. The living memory of the diamond luminosity is, for me, a more effective spiritual vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.

> essions I was given many practices—told, “Do this, do that”—and I took those into my daily practice.
In the last five years of my work, as I discuss in the Diamond Luminosity chapter, I entered Vajrayana Buddhism. I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.

Chris Bache
One gift of my psychedelic experiences was a deepened appreciation for the power and effectiveness of classic contemplative practices, including Vajrayana. By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.

> vehicle than beautiful tankas that attempt to depict sublime perfection. So I modify it in that way.
I also have a sense—because I’ve “died” so many times and gone where I will go when I die physically—that I feel very comfortable with that domain. We’re told over and over that we practice to prepare for the moment of death because it has great potential for accelerating our evolution. I agree. My psychedelic practice has been done in a way to prepare me for the moment of death. The result is that I feel comfortable with death and with navigating what comes after, because I feel I’ve already encountered it in many ways.

This resonates deeply—acknowledging the hubris of saying “my path betokens the truth, therefore yours is true because it relates to mine.” But with that caveat, there are many resonances, especially the notion of purification. As we start to close for today, one section that really spoke to me was your interjection of the Vajrayana path, and how it might create a holding environment to support, augment, and transition—more organic, phenomenological means versus purely neurological ones. For people listening who want something to take home: what has been, and continues to be, the role of meditation and Vajrayana in augmenting, supporting, enhancing, stabilizing what you’ve gone through?

> ferently, where causal-level reality is a different physics, a different landscape of consciousness.
When you open to these depths and then return to ordinary consciousness, it’s really important to have a daily practice to anchor you, to keep your feet on the ground. The skills cultivated in Vipassana or zazen—observation and non-attachment—are precisely the skills you use in a psychedelic session, so they reinforce each other. Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.

In the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a ChÃ¶d practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions. I immediately learned that practice and began doing it before any session. I would never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.

> never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.
Working at very high energetic levels sometimes set in motion processes difficult to integrate in my subtle energy system. If you know Alex Grey’s depictions of powerful energies triggered in deep psychedelic work, you’ll recognize how, after a session, your system can feel achy and stretched. Vajrayana practices—Guru Yoga or deity yoga—gave that energy a place to run when I was back in ordinary consciousness and body. So for clarifying cognitive content, practicing teachings given in sessions, and managing the energetic consequences, a daily spiritual practice is really important.

> u’ve used Dharmakaya. Are there other Tibetan or Buddhist terms that relate to what you experienced?
Chris Bache:
Yes. Clear light mind, to me, is closer to the nature of mind in this context. I’m still digesting the differences between Diamond Luminosity as an extra-samsaric reality and Diamond Luminosity as the foundation of nirmanakaya existence. There are many correlations, and all honor to the great beings who have explored these dimensions more deeply than I’ve been able to—always a humble student of the great teachers. I put names as best I can to clarify, but it’s tricky—naming can shrink-wrap and stop the mystery, letting the mind back in where it doesn’t belong. So let me step into a little different framework.

> ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?
Chris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.

That’s exquisite. And I wonder if “growing down” might be a more appropriate embodied aspect—because “growing up” can sound like moksha, escapist, FedEx my consciousness to a pure land. It’s really waking down into the majesty—integrating your work, metabolizing, digesting, incorporating—literally bringing into soma this vast realization.

> undation. I believe we are on the threshold of becoming a species of Buddhas, Christs, and prophets.
After the benediction of blessings, I felt completely fulfilled. The universe had asked something of me, and in offering it up, I was rewarded with more joy than I could have ever imagined—a philosopher’s dream come true. I had known God, the fertile void, and profound joy. Little did I know I still had five years to go in this journey. After one more cycle of death and rebirth, I entered an extraordinarily clear state of consciousness—which I came to call diamond luminosity. This is what Buddhists refer to as Dharmakaya, the absolute clear light of being. Though I had encountered light in many subtle dimensions before, diamond light is of a different order entirely—ultra-clear, super-luminous, beyond imagination.

> sociated with the concept of Dharmakaya—the fundamental reality that is the source of all existence.
Let me back up: light entered my experiences in many forms and levels—many gradations. I'd experienced light many times in earlier death-rebirth processes. When I talk about the diamond light, it isn't just a metaphor: I'm describing an exceptionally clear and intense awareness, a crystalline light that eventually becomes transparent to itself. In those last five years—the last 26 sessions, about a third of all my work—I entered that reality four times, about once a year. Each time involved more detoxification, and about a year later, I'd re-enter that reality. That’s the kind of larger overview.

> art expansion, a deep opening of the mind, an awakening of compassion—the birth of the diamond soul.
I was 15 years into my journey, blessed beyond imagining, asked to give something in the ocean of suffering work, and rewarded with more blessings than I could count. Still, five years remained. I went through yet another death-and-rebirth and entered what I call the domain of diamond luminosity—a reality exceptionally clear. It was light, but a particular quality. I’d known light many times—people often experience great light at ego death—but the diamond light isn’t a metaphor. It’s a particular quality: exceptionally pure, so clear it takes your breath away. I think Buddhism calls this Dharmakaya, the clear light of absolute reality.

Over the next four years and 26 sessions—about a third of all my sessions—I only entered this reality four times. In between, more purification, more teaching, more absorbing lessons. The first two sessions took me deeper into diamond luminosity; then there was a pivot. In the last two, the diamond luminosity was crunching itself deeper into my mind, personality, physiology, biochemistry.

I was given teachings reframing the goal of reincarnation. Much inherited teaching arose in cultures where the pattern was: we’re mired in illusion, we grow slowly through incarnations, eventually awaken to our divine nature, and then leave time and space—moksha, escape. Many cosmologies of the last few millennia are “up and out”: salvation, realization, and departure to an off-planet paradise. I think that’s incomplete—representing a developmental stage, not the end.

Another session, which I titled "Jesus' Blood," was an overwhelming experience of cosmic love. It's being drenched in a love so deep you realize you've never truly been loved until you've been loved like God loves—a force far deeper than anything I had encountered before. Another pivotal experience was the "birth of the diamond soul." Eleven years prior, I had an experience of my life as a completed whole, from start to finish, but in my fortieth session, I began to sense the integration of all my former lives. It was as if all my previous incarnations were winding together, like a string of white light around a kite spool. When this collective memory hit a critical mass, it exploded, fusing all those individual lives into one, and my consciousness soared beyond any sense of individual existence. I experienced what I call diamond luminosity—my heart ruptured, and my awareness expanded dramatically. This was my first taste of the state where I believe reincarnation is taking us.

What a wonderful vision. Even as you recount it now, I can see you going into your experience, deeply touched decades later. It’s an exquisite example of how these experiences continue to incarnate in and as you. And you emphasized again that awakenings aren’t the end point; beyond them is integration—allowing the realization to incarnate through us. You pointed to diamond vision and its resonance with Tibetan Buddhism. Interestingly, Tibetan Buddhism speaks of a further stage—pure perception—where one’s perception is transformed so that this world is seen not as mundane materiality but as an expression of that diamond illumination, a pure land optimized for awakening. Your description of both the illumination and its effects mirrors what’s recognized and highly valued in certain traditions.

Chris Bache:
In my experience, working at high doses, every session breaks down into two phases: a purification phase and an ecstatic phase. There’s the dark, hard, death-and-dying kind of phase, and then the ecstatic phase. In reference to this work, James’ excellent talk this morning about shadow work was on point. Working as I did in a non-therapeutic modality, one of the great gifts I learned from Stan Grof is to completely, absolutely surrender to whatever is taking place in your sessions and let it take you as far as it wants to take you.

Stepping back, all the religions of the last 5,000 years have been what I would call “up-and-out” cosmologies: you achieve salvation or awakening, and once you achieve that state, you leave. The Hindu word for enlightenment was moksha—escape—escaping time and space. I think those cosmologies got half the message, but lost half the message. They represent incomplete visions of history because they leave unanswered the question: What is the purpose of time and space? What is the purpose of this magnificent universe? It’s been called a veil of suffering, a place to get out of as quickly as we can to return to divine bliss. I understand that, given the historical period when we began to have experiential access to deep divine truths. Naturally we would feel drawn to being there, and if we could not realize those truths here, we would want to be there.

Over five years and 26 sessions, I was taken into this reality only four times. In between, there was tremendous purification. In these states, you dissolve into light, take on the qualities and boundlessness of light—you dissolve in the crystalline nature of the Divine. I don’t mean divine in any conventional or theistic sense, but I have no other vocabulary for it. In each of those four adventures going deeper, the divine began to come deeper into my body. I was handled carefully and broken down, and then this consciousness brought me to the end of my work, gave me an overview of all my sessions, showed me the whole pattern, and gave me my final instructions. I didn’t know it was over until it called it. I knew then I had to stop.

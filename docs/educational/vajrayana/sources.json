I don’t think that Chöd, or Buddhism for that matter, steered my experience in this direction. I think that the trajectory that took me into the Diamond Luminosity was established in the years that led up to this breakthrough. Even so, it was a blessing when these two came together in my life. Vajrayana practice worked well with my psychedelic practice, both in opening the psychedelic window and in reinforcing the result. Vajrayana means the “Diamond Way,” and it was in the *sutras* (scriptures) and *termas* (hidden teachings) of Tibet that I found the clearest exposition of the Diamond Luminosity I had entered. I know that light is discussed in many spiritual traditions, and I’m sure I could find parallels between my experience of this light and their teachings, but it was my karma to find what I needed in Vajrayana, and I am grateful to Carol for bringing me into this lineage.",

And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.",

While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less.

Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering.

Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric.

        "text": "ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?\nChris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.",

But the path I was on is not the contemplative path. It’s a path of temporary immersion. When I’m describing things, it always has to be understood that these are temporary experiences. We can talk about unpacking their spiritual potential, but it’s not the same as coming into these experiences via the “slow-bake” method of sustained contemplation. I want to keep apples and oranges separate, because many people think, “I’ve had a tremendous revelatory enlightenment experience,” and—well, good for you—but that’s a temporary experience.",

Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.",

All honor to the great masters who've done this through the power of their own daily practice—they were always my teachers and masters. What they describe and what I experienced seem to fit hand in glove; there's nothing new there. The only difference is the method—someone with modest spiritual capacity, if they have enough determination and courage to submit to the regimen, might have a temporary experience of these things. As Huston Smith said, “A mystical experience does not a mystic make”—you can’t use these experiences to maintain that consciousness permanently. It would be nice if you could, but by going back and forth, and doing the daily practices, hopefully more and more of it internalizes in your being and you grow.",

The first two times, I was taken deeper into it and had the encounter with what I call the absolute light, which showed me it’s an infinite progression. The next two times, the diamond luminosity began to crunch itself deeper into my physical being. I wasn’t going out; it was coming in—into my psyche and body. It felt like it was changing me at a cellular level. By the very end of my journey, my perception had changed—how I literally see things. Not permanently, but it gave me a temporary experience I call diamond vision. I was seeing a hundred, a thousand times more sharply and clearly than ever before. I realized I was seeing through the eyes of the future human—seeing in a way all humanity will one day see. All our senses—sight, touch, taste—are being elevated to higher levels the more consciousness we can internalize in our bodies.",

When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired.

Yes, you can work through multiple layers of the bardo, the after-death states; you can go into extra-samsaric reality, spiritual dimensions beyond the bardo.

First, the mechanics. Second, the meaning. Third—and most important—the transmission of lung, the seed energy of the practice. You receive a seed from a teacher who has matured the practice in their being, and you water and nourish it in yours.\n\nThat’s my context for transmission, and it applies in my psychedelic context. I was put through enormous purification to receive teachings from those levels of consciousness. If there’s a parallel between the cushion and the psychedelic session—and if we’re in a historical shift—then my intuition is that we’re experiencing a rise in divine influx. There’s more energy coming up underneath us, more information becoming available—not just physically via the internet, but from the center of our being. Teachings and insights are rising inside us, which we can catch, but to catch them we must prepare ourselves. We have to empty ourselves of what is small to receive pieces of what is large.

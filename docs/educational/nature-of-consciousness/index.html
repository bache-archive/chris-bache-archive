      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶3 (1 · 9)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have experienced it, consciousness is an infinite ocean of experiential possibilities. When we take these amplifying medicines, the mind we drop into this ocean acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes a certain set of experiences from its infinite potential. As we are gradually healed, purified, and transformed by these encounters, the seed crystal of our mind is changed. […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe […] In this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. […] Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.8 §0 ¶32 (8 · 0)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reduced to its essence the teaching was this: Matter is the canvas that mind paints upon. It has no capacity to act apart from the animating presence of consciousness and is responsive to the direction of consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §10 ¶9 (1 · 10)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the <em>causal level</em> of consciousness, the world of separate parts begins to yield to an experience of the universe moving as a single entity. […] “Everything breathes together.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶1 (1 · 9)</strong></p>

<p>The more I have thought about the extraordinary range of experiences that opened on my journey, the more I have come to appreciate the complex dynamics of psychedelic disclosure. In these states, we are using consciousness to explore consciousness, and a fascinating dance takes place […]</p>

<p>Consciousness is that with which we know—the knowing function, the awareness through which we know anything else.<br />

<p>I always felt myself engaging—and being engaged by—a larger consciousness. […] Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from this infinite field. […] The guiding consciousness felt constant to me but remained formless.<br />

<p>That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped […] Our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman.<br />

<p>Ultimately, all physical reality is sourced in an ocean of light, an ocean of radiance. […] You stop being a time-space being at all. […] There is always a profound sense of homecoming and return.<br />

<p>The consciousness we enter into in psychedelic states is an infinite consciousness capable of generating any number of experiences. […] As you change, that intersection changes.<br />

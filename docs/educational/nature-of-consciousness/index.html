<p>Christopher M. Bache is a scholar known for his exploration of consciousness, particularly in relation to psychedelic experiences and their implications for understanding the nature of reality. His work delves into the intersection of consciousness, spirituality, and the cosmos, proposing that consciousness may be a fundamental aspect of the universe. Bache's research raises important questions about the evolution of consciousness and the potential for integrating profound experiential insights into broader philosophical and scientific frameworks.</p>

Chris Bache:
…shared in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—infused with mind and soul. And, of course, now we know how vast the physical universe is, and the question becomes: how large is the mind of the universe? How deep is it?</p>

<p>I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.</p>

<p>f the evolution and ecology of consciousness? Where might we focus our intentions on a path forward?
Chris Bache
About halfway through my journey, in the 38th session, in a year of enormous blessings, I was taken on an experience preceded by very intense purification—very intense death-rebirth processes. At one phase in this journey, I experienced all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before. I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives, and I’d already written a book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But this was different: my former lives began coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They hit a critical mass and fused. There was an explosion of energy, and all these separate lives fused into one life. A burst of diamond light came out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. Then I was given a lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening. It changed my understanding of how reincarnation works and where it’s taking us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure everyone can track with you there—the universe has a mind? Tell us what you discovered.
Chris Bache
As I came to experience it, consciousness is like an infinite ocean. When we open ourselves in deep psychedelic states, it’s as if our mind is a seed-catalyst dropped into this ocean, and it crystallizes a set of experiences out of this infinite potential. By absorbing and internalizing what we’re being offered—what we’re being taught—we’re changed, purified, transformed inwardly. Then, when we drop that changed mind back into the infinite potential, it triggers an even deeper set of experiences from its infinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I experienced myself as engaging an intelligence—a consciousness—that was directing my sessions. I did not control what was unfolding. I was always yielding and following a lead that came from deeper levels of consciousness. As the journey continued, the levels of consciousness I was entering deepened multiple times.</p>

<p>d without psychedelics? How can one remember past lives? Maybe starting with: what is consciousness?
Chris Bache:
I’m happy to let psychologists and philosophers tear their hair out on that one. I’ll go with whatever definition they come up with as long as it’s sufficiently broad to incorporate the total phenomenology of consciousness. Simply, consciousness comes from “con” + “scire”—to know. Consciousness is that with which we know—the knowing function, the awareness through which we know anything else.</p>

<p>Emmy Vadnais:
So you feel like you’re still integrating the experiences?
Chris Bache:
Very much so. It raises substantial intellectual questions: how do you possibly integrate experiences that so radically transcend the conditions of time and space and our consciousness inside time and space? If you have temporary experiences that go radically beyond spatial consciousness and linear time, what does it even mean to integrate them? What does integration look like when you’re dealing with such radical experiences? With lower-dose work or gentler psychedelics, where experiences come closer to your world inside time and space, integration is less demanding. But if you really open the very deep waters of the psyche, integration becomes a more substantive issue.</p>
<p>Emmy Vadnais:
We’re getting lots of questions. This one from Robert Bushman might be a good place to start: What is consciousness? Is there an ultimate reality, or is it infinitely fractal? How can an individual’s conscious awareness expand without psychedelics? How can one remember past lives? Maybe starting with: what is consciousness?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.
Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we do with that as a species—imagine what we can do operating from that kind of consciousness.
Tasshin Fogleman:
I’m getting the sense—coming back to what might be incomplete about Buddhism or earlier teachings—that the sensibility I received was: existence is a cycle of birth and death that is, in some ways, hellish, and you should escape. From what I’m hearing, both individually and collectively, the aim isn’t to escape but to learn, grow, evolve, increase complexity and nuance and understanding of oneself and the universe, and really to manifest that, rather than just getting out or eradicating it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Bache:
Yes, I think so. In the end, once we make this transition, we understand that what we have escaped is not time and space, but a constricted consciousness associated with living inside time and space. When that bubble pops—when we truly escape that small world—we experience time and space completely differently: as the Buddha world, as Buddha nature.</p>
<p>Tasshin Fogleman:
If you don’t mind me asking, what is your everyday consciousness like now after all of these experiences and explorations?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>any insights on how psychedelics or raising consciousness might help us find a better path forward?
Chris Bache:
Let’s hold the second part and address the first, because this was one of the biggest surprises of my work. First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.</p>

<p>method is deeply interesting. Could you start by telling us what it is and what your work has been?
Chris Bache: What we share in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—with mind and soul. Now that we know how vast the physical universe is, the question becomes: how large and how deep is the mind of the universe? Just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted.

<blockquote>
<p>ience at the right time. In your journeys you describe a sense of guidance. Could you speak to that?
Chris Bache:
I always felt myself engaging—and being engaged by—a larger consciousness. It didn’t take concrete, personified form. Its core qualities changed as I went deeper. The way I think of it: the consciousness we enter into in psychedelic states is an infinite consciousness capable of generating any number of experiences. Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from this infinite field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do this repeatedly, as you integrate experiences and undergo purifications, your consciousness changes. The consciousness you take into the next encounter catalyzes a deeper set of experiences from the infinite potential. What you experience as a guiding intelligence arises at the intersection of your individual mind and the universal mind; as you change, that intersection changes. The guiding consciousness felt constant to me but remained formless, seldom adopting concrete form—because forms would change as the experiences deepened.</p>

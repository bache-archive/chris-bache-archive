When we take these amplifying medicines, the mind we drop into this ocean acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes a certain set of experiences from its infinite potential. As we are gradually healed, purified, and transformed by these encounters, the seed crystal of our mind is changed. In subsequent sessions, it catalyzes still deeper experiences from this ocean. If we repeat this process many times in a sustained fashion, a sequence of initiations into successively deeper levels of consciousness takes place, and a deepening visionary communion unfolds. Each segment of this communion tends to pick up where the previous segment stopped. Sometimes there is a very tight continuity between the sessions, sometimes it is broader, but it’s always there woven into the fabric of engagement.",

We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.",

A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life.

There is no reference point outside this Oneness from which to get a perspective on it, as it is the whole of existence. Here, as Plotinus succinctly put it, “Everything breathes together.” Or as Sri Aurobindo described it, “In this vision of things the universe will reveal itself in its unity and totality as a manifestation of a single Being, Nature as its power of manifestation, evolution as its process of gradual self-revelation in matter.”",

When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a *cosmic communion* to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric.

It not only learns from its individual members, it is also informed by more encompassing levels of consciousness, as suggested by the sessions reported in this chapter. This throws new light on the problem of creativity, which is a problem that Sheldrake has acknowledged his theory cannot solve.

A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind.

What does integration look like when you’re dealing with such radical experiences?

We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.",

From what I’m hearing, both individually and collectively, the aim isn’t to escape but to learn, grow, evolve, increase complexity and nuance and understanding of oneself and the universe, and really to manifest that, rather than just getting out or eradicating it.\n\nChris Bache:\nYes, I think so. In the end, once we make this transition, we understand that what we have escaped is not time and space, but a constricted consciousness associated with living inside time and space. When that bubble pops—when we truly escape that small world—we experience time and space completely differently: as the Buddha world, as Buddha nature.\n\nTasshin Fogleman:\nIf you don’t mind me asking, what is your everyday consciousness like now after all of these experiences and explorations?",

Now that we know how vast the physical universe is, the question becomes: how large and how deep is the mind of the universe? Just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I saw his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but to philosophy: he was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness, where the answers to the philosophical questions I carried from religious studies might lie.",

Its core qualities changed as I went deeper. The way I think of it: the consciousness we enter into in psychedelic states is an infinite consciousness capable of generating any number of experiences. Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from this infinite field.\n\nIf you do this repeatedly, as you integrate experiences and undergo purifications, your consciousness changes. The consciousness you take into the next encounter catalyzes a deeper set of experiences from the infinite potential. What you experience as a guiding intelligence arises at the intersection of your individual mind and the universal mind; as you change, that intersection changes. The guiding consciousness felt constant to me but remained formless, seldom adopting concrete form—because forms would change as the experiences deepened.",

Our nature is the nature of the divine, which is the nature of reality itself. So it’s not completely accurate to frame this as a duality between me and It. At a deeper level, my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality. Our relationship is deeply essential and mutually participating from the start. But functionally, in terms of Chris Bache, I am so small and It is so vast that there’s a relative duality involved. And between my small bit and the totality are layers upon layers.

I eventually differentiated five levels of consciousness that seemed operational. The first takes place at the level of personal mind, where you go beyond your personal time-space identity, culminating in what we classically call ego death—your consciousness exploding beyond the parameters of your physical experience. The second takes place at the collective level of mind—species mind—lots of experiences in the collective unconscious. The third goes deeper into the archetypal mind, beyond the species mind into archetypal reality. The fourth is the One Mind—causal reality—where the fundamental theme is oneness. There are many degrees and permutations of oneness, but that’s the core domain. In the last five years of my work, I entered what I came to call the Diamond Luminosity— the clear light of absolute reality, as it's called in Buddhism, Dharmakaya.",

How can that be, that an individual awakes yet another does not?\nChris Bache:\nThe metaphor I like to use when teaching my students is that of leaves and the tree. Imagine leaves being individually conscious, yet they are manifestations of the consciousness of the tree. So we are individually conscious, and there is a narrative of individual evolution, but if you really dig deep and ask “what is an individual?” then you encounter the collective psyche—the consciousness of the planet, the galaxy, and then deeper, as you say, the absolute, what I call my belovedness. Individual awakening is a mistaken inference. It’s true that if you don’t work individually, you make no progress, but when you do, you're actually drawing many people's consciousness into your work. So it’s impossible to put a boundary on awakening; the universe doesn't even think in terms of individuals—it's interested in awakening the entire species. Not this religion, that continent, but the whole human family into evolutionary progression. I began to realize I wasn’t doing these sessions for personal work or healing, or even personal transformation.",

While we are in the Bardo Earth kind of stage after death, we return to whole consciousness. It’s not unfamiliar; it’s something we know. Then we precipitate out of whole consciousness into part consciousness—egoic consciousness—and return. It’s a constant accordion effect: we die and get large; we’re born and get small; we die and get large; we’re born and get small. Sooner or later—if we just keep up for a few thousand years, a hundred million years—large wakes up inside physical consciousness. It’s simply a consolidation of what takes place naturally and normally, a stage in the process.",

We know about emergence; things happen in jumps, we hit tipping points. We think we’re coming to an evolutionary tipping point. When people have near-death experiences, they go through exponential increases in awareness in a very short time. More than one author has suggested that the human race is coming to a collective near-death experience—a potential jumping point. If fields can tip in small groups—if we hit that at large scale, in darkness or early dawn—I’d say we have a long way to go and little time to get there. The only way we could possibly make that kind of evolutionary progress is by understanding field dynamics, because then we’re not trying to change seven billion minds—we only need to change one mind, and the seven billion experiences are being processed at an integral level. If we understand nonlinear systems, and hypothesize the human collective unconscious as such a system, then when it’s thrown into far-from-equilibrium conditions, things can happen fast; there can be jumps. I really think that some dynamic like that underlies humanity’s potential for quantum change. It’s not simply an aggregate of individuals—there’s a deeper summation coming from all those individuals.",

We’re just scratching the surface. If we’re working therapeutically and bringing out issues from the personal unconscious, we have a model for integration. If we go deeper and have spiritual experiences of the intelligence running through life, we have spiritual models.

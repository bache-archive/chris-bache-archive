> So even though LSD had been made illegal in 1970, I chose to conscientiously break the law and begin a series of rigorously structured sessions following Stan’s protocol. After three medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at high doses. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. I would be much gentler on myself if I were doing it over again, but at the time this is what I was doing to accelerate my own spiritual development. Quickly it evolved into engaging the deep structures of human evolution and trying to support humanity’s spiritual development, and then exploring this marvelous universe that we are part of.

Let’s start with the title: LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I’m not sure everyone can track with you there—the universe has a mind? Tell us what you discovered.

> David has framed our conversation as the question of whether we can all access the cosmic mind using psychedelics. I believe that we all can, but whether we all should is another matter entirely. In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.

> In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves. What’s important is the vision of the cosmos they contain, and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point we’re coming to.

> We all suffer from the carryover of our culture’s experience with psychedelics in the 1960s and the negative press generated around them, when the true story is very different. Psychedelics in general, and LSD in particular, function as non-specific amplifiers and catalysts of consciousness. They don’t give you a particular experience; they hyper-amplify your consciousness. If you use those hours of hyper-amplified consciousness carefully—shutting out all outside stimulus and focusing entirely within—you can use them to explore and, in a sense, excavate the deep architecture of the psyche and the nature of consciousness itself.

> The circumstances were unusually stable, concentrated, and focused: the same sitter for years, same set and setting, intention, location (Northeast Ohio), substance, dose level, and the same recording process—always recording each session as completely as possible within 24 hours. When you stabilize your work—eliminate variables, use the same methodology consistently—it stabilizes the conversation between you and the creative intelligence of the universe. It stabilizes the communion so that one session leads to the next in a coherent, intelligent manner. You may not understand the continuity as it unfolds, but over time you see patterns and feel you’re engaging a single creative intelligence. I say that carefully—there are many layers and forms of intelligence—but across sessions the continuity is unmistakable.

> Then I wrote The Living Classroom in 2008. Even though my students never knew about my psychedelic experiences—I didn’t talk about them on campus for obvious legal reasons—I found that my students were being impacted by my work. There was a ripple effect: the deeper I went into the unified fabric of reality, the more ripples of transformation seemed to radiate around me. I had to study this, to understand what was happening. The Living Classroom is about collective consciousness; I don’t mention psychedelics because the issue is the nature of consciousness itself. It doesn’t matter which transformational method you use—if you go deeply enough, ramifications will spread out around you in 360 degrees.

> The beginning of this book goes back over 40 years. In 1978, when I began graduate school, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work. His book Realms of the Human Unconscious turned my life around, followed quickly by LSD Psychotherapy. He gave me the method and the confidence to explore my consciousness and, through that exploration, to come to know the deep psyche—the deep universe—better. I want to emphasize I did this work as a philosopher. I was not a therapist. I wasn’t primarily seeking healing—though healing did come—but seeking to understand our universe as deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness as deeply as I could.

> As vast as the universe is—billions of galaxies, immense age and scale—this universe has a mind as deep, broad, and old as its body is. My individual experience of consciousness is a drop, a fractal aspect of the totality of consciousness that flows. That’s why I gave the book the title LSD and the Mind of the Universe: when you go very deep using a powerful and circumscribed protocol, you drop into deeper and deeper layers and are given the opportunity to explore the very nature of physical reality itself.

> Chris Bache: Well, I’ve done that as carefully as I can in my book, LSD in the Mind of the Universe. The invitation is to appreciate that we only became conscious of the Mother Universe about 5,000 years ago—when we developed sufficient discipline to drop beneath the conditioning of our individual egoic mind and tap into the stream of consciousness we share with all life. We’ve been walking upright for 5.8 million years, operating with our larger brain for about 200,000 years. Writing came in about 5,000 years ago; the Upanishadic breakthroughs, three to four thousand years ago. But these are nothing compared to the billions of years ahead. We’re just waking up to who we are, so naturally we get confused given the enormity of what we’re growing into.

> I published a book in 2008, after I stopped my sessions, called The Living Classroom, in which I lay it all out—but I never mentioned psychedelics, because the issue is not psychedelics; the issue is consciousness, the potential of consciousness. If you do very deep consciousness work without psychedelics, I think you can trigger the same things. Just recently—this month—SUNY Press is bringing out a second edition of The Living Classroom, and they invited me to tell the truth about my psychedelic practice because I'm out of the closet by now; LSD in the Mind of the Universe is out. So the new edition makes clear that my psychedelic practice was driving the phenomena that emerged in my classes, even though other people not using psychedelics can experience the same thing.

Chris Bache:
…shared in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—infused with mind and soul. And, of course, now we know how vast the physical universe is, and the question becomes: how large is the mind of the universe? How deep is it?

I was just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, when I met the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I immediately saw that his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but also to philosophy. He was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness where the answers to the philosophical questions I was carrying lay, coming out of training in religious studies.

Chris Bache
About halfway through my journey, in the 38th session, in a year of enormous blessings, I was taken on an experience preceded by very intense purification—very intense death-rebirth processes. At one phase in this journey, I experienced all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before. I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives, and I’d already written a book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But this was different: my former lives began coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They hit a critical mass and fused. There was an explosion of energy, and all these separate lives fused into one life. A burst of diamond light came out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. Then I was given a lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening. It changed my understanding of how reincarnation works and where it’s taking us.

> d without psychedelics? How can one remember past lives? Maybe starting with: what is consciousness?
Chris Bache:
I’m happy to let psychologists and philosophers tear their hair out on that one. I’ll go with whatever definition they come up with as long as it’s sufficiently broad to incorporate the total phenomenology of consciousness. Simply, consciousness comes from “con” + “scire”—to know. Consciousness is that with which we know—the knowing function, the awareness through which we know anything else.

> d in those first 20 years.

Emmy Vadnais:
So you feel like you’re still integrating the experiences?
Chris Bache:
Very much so. It raises substantial intellectual questions: how do you possibly integrate experiences that so radically transcend the conditions of time and space and our consciousness inside time and space? If you have temporary experiences that go radically beyond spatial consciousness and linear time, what does it even mean to integrate them? What does integration look like when you’re dealing with such radical experiences? With lower-dose work or gentler psychedelics, where experiences come closer to your world inside time and space, integration is less demanding. But if you really open the very deep waters of the psyche, integration becomes a more substantive issue.

Emmy Vadnais:
We’re getting lots of questions. This one from Robert Bushman might be a good place to start: What is consciousness? Is there an ultimate reality, or is it infinitely fractal? How can an individual’s conscious awareness expand without psychedelics? How can one remember past lives? Maybe starting with: what is consciousness?

> sing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.
Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?

Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.

> What we do with that as a species—imagine what we can do operating from that kind of consciousness.
Tasshin Fogleman:
I’m getting the sense—coming back to what might be incomplete about Buddhism or earlier teachings—that the sensibility I received was: existence is a cycle of birth and death that is, in some ways, hellish, and you should escape. From what I’m hearing, both individually and collectively, the aim isn’t to escape but to learn, grow, evolve, increase complexity and nuance and understanding of oneself and the universe, and really to manifest that, rather than just getting out or eradicating it.

Chris Bache:
Yes, I think so. In the end, once we make this transition, we understand that what we have escaped is not time and space, but a constricted consciousness associated with living inside time and space. When that bubble pops—when we truly escape that small world—we experience time and space completely differently: as the Buddha world, as Buddha nature.

Tasshin Fogleman:
If you don’t mind me asking, what is your everyday consciousness like now after all of these experiences and explorations?

> any insights on how psychedelics or raising consciousness might help us find a better path forward?
Chris Bache:
Let’s hold the second part and address the first, because this was one of the biggest surprises of my work. First, I had to let go of framing my work as personal journey—personal transformation, personal healing, personal awakening—and get involved in a much larger dance with the species mind and the collective unconscious, then be catapulted into archetypal reality and deeper, causal levels.

What I'm about to say about where we are historically will sound outrageous and highly speculative, but when you work very deeply—far underneath the personal psyche, dropping into the collective psyche and into the creative intent underlying the evolution of our species—these things come into focus in ways that make sense from a quantum or post-Newtonian paradigm.

> method is deeply interesting. Could you start by telling us what it is and what your work has been?
Chris Bache: What we share in the animistic community is the belief that nature is infused with consciousness—with mind and soul. Now that we know how vast the physical universe is, the question becomes: how large and how deep is the mind of the universe? Just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted.

> ience at the right time. In your journeys you describe a sense of guidance. Could you speak to that?
Chris Bache:
I always felt myself engaging—and being engaged by—a larger consciousness. It didn’t take concrete, personified form. Its core qualities changed as I went deeper. The way I think of it: the consciousness we enter into in psychedelic states is an infinite consciousness capable of generating any number of experiences. Our mind acts as a seed crystal that catalyzes certain experiences from this infinite field.

If you do this repeatedly, as you integrate experiences and undergo purifications, your consciousness changes. The consciousness you take into the next encounter catalyzes a deeper set of experiences from the infinite potential. What you experience as a guiding intelligence arises at the intersection of your individual mind and the universal mind; as you change, that intersection changes. The guiding consciousness felt constant to me but remained formless, seldom adopting concrete form—because forms would change as the experiences deepened.

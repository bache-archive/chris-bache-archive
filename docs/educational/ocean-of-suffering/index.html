    <h2>Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)</h2>
    <div class="stack">
      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §8 ¶7</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a</em> cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. […] <em>It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.4 §0 ¶8</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The encounter with the ocean of suffering lasted fourteen sessions spread over two years of work. […] From the perspective of the experiences themselves, this six-year interruption was a mere bump in the road that changed nothing.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶2</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Accordingly, when the ocean of suffering opened after what had appeared to be a solid ego-death […] I interpreted it to mean that some stubborn remnant of my ego must have slipped through the therapeutic net […] I thought that this collective suffering would eventually lead to a more complete ego-death.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶34</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My consciousness was expanding and opening to more and more suffering. […] I reached more deeply into the suffering and eventually broke through to this larger dimension.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.5 §0 ¶3</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Ocean of Suffering was a terrible ordeal to endure, but each time I emerged from it I entered a reality that was stunning and intoxicating […] into what I first called “whole time” and later</em> Deep Time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶10</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s not that the universe wants us to suffer […] there is a certain suffering inherent in repeatedly shedding our psychological skin in order to enter more deeply into the universe.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.4 §0 ¶7</strong>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Once I learned what was waiting for me inside the sessions, the mornings of a session day were tense. […] Carol called it “going into the tunnel.”</em></p>

      <blockquote>
<p>It took me about two and a half years to go through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal dimension […] Then the ocean of suffering began. […] Eventually […] I concluded it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation at all. It was aimed at healing the human species.<br />

<p>The ocean of suffering was much harder and more demanding than dissolving my personal ego. […] There’s a rhythm: purification, then ecstasy. […] The deeper the purification, the deeper the blessings.<br />

<p>When I first began to enter the ocean of suffering […] each session tended to divide into two halves: a purification half followed by an ecstatic half.<br />

<p>The ocean of suffering lasted two years and 14 sessions […] After the break, the ocean of suffering picked up exactly where it had left off.<br />

<p>Beyond personal and soul-level unfinished business, you can encounter trauma that is species-wide. […] By letting humanity’s suffering enter full awareness, a transformation takes place that registers in the individual, but also—this is my hypothesis—registers in the species as a whole.<br />

<p>I don’t think everyone has to go into it. […] I think my soul chose to do this before I was born. […] The universe more than rewarded me for this phase.<br />

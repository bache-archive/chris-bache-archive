<p>s—first to remember it, and then to digest it and let it seep into your bones as deeply as possible.
John Dupuy:
You talk in the book about how you came to understand that the hell realms—the suffering realms you had to visit—were for your benefit, for purification, preparing you for revelation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Bache:
It’s complicated. It took me about two and a half years to go through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal dimension of consciousness—very intense physical and emotional purifications, which eventually ended in ego death, being shattered, my entire physical identity turned inside out. Then the ocean of suffering began. At first I thought it was a deeper form of personal suffering, a deeper form of ego death. Eventually—and this is why I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn at core, to solve the riddle of why the suffering got as large as it did—I concluded it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation at all. It was aimed at healing the human species.</p>

<p>stantiation of the universe—every life, the ones that suffer and the ones that don't suffer as much.
Chris Bache
And I address this in Lifecycles: human suffering brings us to our knees, and I don’t think we have an adequate understanding or explanation of it. In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ain and suffering to reach deeper levels of consciousness. Can you share what that was like for you?
Chris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had. You lose yourself, enter communion with the universe, and when you come back you gather the experiences, and my personality synthesizes and integrates them. It’s a pulsing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>y of contrast and suffering as essential conditions for learning and growth in the human experience?
Chris Bache:
Great question. The question of suffering is profound; we could spend the whole program on it. If the creative intelligence is intelligent and loving, how could it have tolerated—let alone manifested—a world so painful, where terrible things happen at an organic and social level? To even attempt to comprehend suffering, we need a very long time horizon, a deep look into the workings of the universe—a galactic perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The human species is radically unfinished, very incomplete. How young are we? On a 1-to-100 scale, are we 95% finished or 5%? I think we’re more like 5–10%. We just woke up—4,000 or 5,000 years ago—to the underlying level of consciousness recognized in the true religious traditions. This universe has been building this world for 3.7 billion years; we’re just waking up and learning to engage consciously rather than unconsciously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>us what that body of collective memory felt like and looked like to you, because we’re still in it.
Chris Bache:
My transition from an ego-death process, which is very personal, led into two years of excruciatingly difficult waves—vast landscapes of human suffering: war, violence, unimaginable anguish. That transition was marked by an experience I call “the killing of the children.” I was an old woman confronting soldiers who were killing thousands of children, smashing their heads on rocks—terrible. I think that experience prepared me for the ocean of suffering phase. It awakened a depth of compassion, embedded at a soul level, to take on the work my soul had chosen in this lifetime. I learned that just as individual trauma gets buried in our psyche and compromises our health, the trauma of history is buried in the collective psyche of humanity. Anything not resolved by the species accumulates in massive memory structures I call metacoic systems. Something guiding my sessions began to use them to confront, absorb, and transmute vast territories of collective anguish embedded in the collective psyche—meaning the patient stopped being Chris Bache and, in some way, became an aspect of the human species.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the level of challenge the same, just with a greater psychic scale, or did it get easier over time?
Chris Bache
The ocean of suffering was much harder and more demanding than dissolving my personal ego—truly a different order of magnitude. I want to be careful not to overemphasize the negative, though, because there’s a rhythm: purification, then ecstasy. The only thing that makes the purification bearable are the ecstatic blessings that follow. After processing the ocean of suffering, I’d also be integrating the gift of earlier unitive experiences—being taken on the “cosmic tour,” visiting the beginning of creation, and so on. This rhythm—of purification and blessing—kept pace throughout. The deeper the purification, the deeper the blessings. Once you learn that rhythm, you’re no longer afraid of purification; you seek it out. Not because you crave pain, but because you long for what lies beyond it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you relate to ecstasy—to realize there’s fundamentally no preference for either? Does that resonate?
Chris Bache
I understand the teaching, and it reflects certain aspects of the journey. I’m not sure it reflects this particular aspect in a satisfying way. I have a different understanding when it comes to what I call the ocean of suffering. I don’t think everyone has to go into it. I don’t think everyone has to enter the hell realms or spend as long there as I did. People don’t need to be afraid that what I went through is a necessary part of any spiritual journey or cosmological exploration. I think my soul chose to do this before I was born. It manifested so quickly in my sessions after a couple of years, and it was such a tenacious, sustained part of my journey that I came to understand it as a soul’s choice. I say this without pride, because many beings today have made the same choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>country with disease and conflict—how does a reincarnation perspective grapple with those realities?
Chris Bache:
Terrible suffering—babies born without a neocortex, anencephalic children; babies born into violent circumstances, destined to die after a very short life with terrible pain. How can we assert that there is intelligence, let alone compassion, in such a universe? To see the wisdom and the intelligence, we have to look very deep and very wide. On the surface, life can be a mean son of a bitch—cruel and vindictive—decimated by circumstances that crush the human heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a reincarnation perspective, our life did not begin with birth, and it does not end at death; our life is part of a larger story. Why someone would choose a life involving so much suffering may be impossible to answer from within a time-space perspective and from within an individual, almost centric perspective. To glimpse larger patterns, we have to open into a very large—evolutionary and spiritual—perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coming back to your explorations, you use the phrase “deep time.” Can you say what you mean by that?
Chris Bache:
When I first began to enter the ocean of suffering—after ego death, moving into episodes of collective anguish—each session tended to divide into two halves: a purification half followed by an ecstatic half. If you submit to the purification, it crescendos to a breakthrough and then you’re spun into a transpersonal section of ecstatic teachings.</p>

<p>pate inside the divine creation of space and time as spiritual beings rooted in spiritual realities.
Aviv Shahar:
We’ll get further into both the divine reality and the cycles of death and rebirth. But just to pick up where you started—the sense of suffering you described—stepping back, what do you understand to be the significance of suffering in the evolutionary process? Why is suffering part of evolution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Bache:
That really is a core question, isn’t it? It’s deep, and hard to answer without preparing the ground, so I’ll take shortcuts and ask your listeners’ indulgence. During the same period of the cosmic tour—when I was being given a crash course in Cosmology 101—I was taken back to what appeared to be the beginning of creation itself, the beginning of time and space, and I experienced an overwhelming love saturating me. It was a cosmic love. Then I witnessed the birth of space and time and all of evolution taking place inside this love, held and guided by it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>t you, Chris. To keep coming back as it shifts from an individual quest to everybody and everything.
Chris Bache:
It may be largely a function of my choice to work with very high doses that blow you deeply into the structure of reality. Not everyone may enter these domains. Over the course of my journey I learned this was a task my soul took on before I was born. It was part of my karmic choice, not forced on me and not a tragedy—simply part of my life’s work. The universe more than rewarded me for this phase. Following the ocean of suffering—indeed within it and afterwards—it took me places and more than repaid me for taking it on. As always, whenever you do anything for others, the universe has no choice but to give back to you—because it acts out of oneness. If we do something for others, it comes back in one form or another.</p>

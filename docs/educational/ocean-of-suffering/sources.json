Did what I think just happened actually happen?” The answer was always the same: “Yes, this is real. This is true.” But how? Inside space-time, we divide our experience into past, present, and future. The past is memory, the present is real, the future is projection. Inside these seven sessions, however, past, present, and future merged into a different experience of time—into what I first called “whole time” and later *Deep Time*.",

When he reflected on how this therapeutic movement might influence the emerging global crisis, he did so in terms of the cumulative impact of healing large numbers of people one person at a time. Accordingly, when the ocean of suffering opened after what had appeared to be a solid ego-death in sessions 9 and 10, I interpreted it to mean that some stubborn remnant of my ego must have slipped through the therapeutic net and that my ego-death was unfinished.

I may make mistakes in telling this story, but I pledge to give an honest account of what took place in my sessions. It is important, therefore, that we understand the role that suffering plays in the psychedelic process, and specifically the suffering of death and rebirth.

Can you share what that was like for you?\nChris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had. You lose yourself, enter communion with the universe, and when you come back you gather the experiences, and my personality synthesizes and integrates them. It’s a pulsing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.",

I want to be careful not to overemphasize the negative, though, because there’s a rhythm: purification, then ecstasy. The only thing that makes the purification bearable are the ecstatic blessings that follow. After processing the ocean of suffering, I’d also be integrating the gift of earlier unitive experiences—being taken on the “cosmic tour,” visiting the beginning of creation, and so on. This rhythm—of purification and blessing—kept pace throughout. The deeper the purification, the deeper the blessings. Once you learn that rhythm, you’re no longer afraid of purification; you seek it out. Not because you crave pain, but because you long for what lies beyond it.",

Does that resonate?\nChris Bache\nI understand the teaching, and it reflects certain aspects of the journey. I’m not sure it reflects this particular aspect in a satisfying way. I have a different understanding when it comes to what I call the ocean of suffering. I don’t think everyone has to go into it. I don’t think everyone has to enter the hell realms or spend as long there as I did. People don’t need to be afraid that what I went through is a necessary part of any spiritual journey or cosmological exploration. I think my soul chose to do this before I was born. It manifested so quickly in my sessions after a couple of years, and it was such a tenacious, sustained part of my journey that I came to understand it as a soul’s choice. I say this without pride, because many beings today have made the same choice.",

With reincarnation, you have to live with it for a long time and bring the questions people are asking into that paradigm, then sit with it to get intimations of the depth of how it recontextualizes the way we usually think. Here’s a question by Jacqueline that really stretches us: how can collective suffering be a creative process rooted in cosmic love? That’s a hard question, because of the sheer scale. It’s hard even for an individual life: how is suffering in our life compatible with the idea that the universe is compassionate and loving? At a collective level—of the type we were talking about in our third dialog, our coming challenging period of history—how can suffering of that magnitude be a creative process rooted in cosmic love?",

At first I thought it was refining my ego death, but eventually I realized it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation. It was aimed at transforming my entire human family. In these sessions, consciousness had expanded far beyond “Chris Bache.” It was as if I were the species, remembering and reliving the species’ pain. By letting humanity’s suffering enter full awareness, a transformation takes place that registers in the individual, but also—this is my hypothesis—registers in the species as a whole.

Look at our lives—how we’re impacting and causing suffering—and take it out, not only between human beings, leading toward a gentler, clearer life, but also toward other species. In Buddhist practice, the first thing you do when you begin any meditation is cultivate bodhicitta, the aspiration to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for yourself. The last thing you do is the distribution of merit: you give away all the merit generated to all levels of being. This shatters the illusion of individual enlightenment.

In a therapeutic modality with psychedelics, your system becomes hyperconscious for a time. When that happens, it spontaneously begins to cleanse itself. It brings forward the parts of your past you’ve struggled with—pain, fear, unfinished business. By confronting those fears and pains heroically, you can bring to resolution things that started in the past but never completed—ugly deaths, problematic relationships, and so on. Embracing the suffering that presents itself—letting it into awareness—allows it to move to a better outcome. The system relaxes, and you’re free to move into deeper levels of reality.\n\nEarly on, as consciousness expands beyond time-space, you may face ego death—the shattering of the identity formed in time-space. It’s painful, an inversion of everything you’ve known yourself to be, but in surrender, consciousness is liberated into deeper textures of mind. If you continue, you cycle through further purifications and deeper deaths, each followed by entry into deeper dimensions of reality, always working a particular edge.",

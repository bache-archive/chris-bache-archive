In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.",

I like the title Diamonds from Heaven better because it’s a story of a journey of deepening intimacy. After sessions, even a grocery store can feel like Disneyland—strange and surreal. That’s our work: go into deeper intimacy with whatever drives the universe, then come back and live our lives as best we can. Reincarnation does this—pulling us out into spiritual reality, plunging us back in, over and over. A psychedelic session reenacts that on a smaller orbit: it shatters the earthly life, opens us to what it’s like to die into the great surrounding world, then we come back into time and space. Do that enough times—incarnate enough times—and you cease to relate to the world as before.",

        "text": "s address suffering, often aiming to end it, but you write that we need to be open to our suffering.\nChris Bache\nLet’s set the context. In a therapeutic modality with psychedelics, your system becomes hyperconscious for a time. When that happens, it spontaneously begins to cleanse itself. It brings forward the parts of your past you’ve struggled with—pain, fear, unfinished business. By confronting those fears and pains heroically, you can bring to resolution things that started in the past but never completed—ugly deaths, problematic relationships, and so on. Embracing the suffering that presents itself—letting it into awareness—allows it to move to a better outcome. The system relaxes, and you’re free to move into deeper levels of reality.\n\nEarly on, as consciousness expands beyond time-space, you may face ego death—the shattering of the identity formed in time-space. It’s painful, an inversion of everything you’ve known yourself to be, but in surrender, consciousness is liberated into deeper textures of mind. If you continue, you cycle through further purifications and deeper deaths, each followed by entry into deeper dimensions of reality, always working a particular edge.",

There were so many layers. Basically, my experience has been that the universe—or the mind of the universe, or the mind of the divine—is an infinite ocean of potential. When we drop our individual mind into that ocean, it catalyzes experiences out of that infinite potential. As we are changed, influenced, healed, and purified by that exchange, the seed crystal of our mind changes. When we later drop that same, now-transformed mind into the ocean, it catalyzes a deeper set of experiences.",

He gave me the method and the confidence to explore my consciousness and, through that exploration, to come to know the deep psyche—the deep universe—better. I want to emphasize I did this work as a philosopher. I was not a therapist.

In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.\n\nIn LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves.

My eventual understanding is this: just as my individual psyche retains all my memories, good and traumatic, there is a consciousness of the human species that retains all of its memories and processes them in a central meta-psychological condition—what Jung called the collective unconscious. That means all the terrible things human beings have done to each other—all the wars, horrors, injustices, rapes, pillaging—to the extent they have not been clarified or healed, become part of the collective torment, the collective shadow of humanity. You might say that within the human psyche there are clusters of memories with a hellish quality. But that doesn’t mean there is a cosmological state of eternal hell, because just as individuals can clear bad experiences from their system, the human species can clear terrible trauma from its system. I think that in the early Church, some who had contact with these collective hellish realms mistakenly interpreted them as a cosmological principle of eternal hell.",

Accordingly, when the ocean of suffering opened after what had appeared to be a solid ego-death in sessions 9 and 10, I interpreted it to mean that some stubborn remnant of my ego must have slipped through the therapeutic net and that my ego-death was unfinished.

It took me about two and a half years to go through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal dimension of consciousness—very intense physical and emotional purifications, which eventually ended in ego death, being shattered, my entire physical identity turned inside out. Then the ocean of suffering began. At first I thought it was a deeper form of personal suffering, a deeper form of ego death. Eventually—and this is why I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn at core, to solve the riddle of why the suffering got as large as it did—I concluded it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation at all. It was aimed at healing the human species.",

In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.",

        "text": "ain and suffering to reach deeper levels of consciousness. Can you share what that was like for you?\nChris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had. You lose yourself, enter communion with the universe, and when you come back you gather the experiences, and my personality synthesizes and integrates them. It’s a pulsing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.",

The question of suffering is profound; we could spend the whole program on it. If the creative intelligence is intelligent and loving, how could it have tolerated—let alone manifested—a world so painful, where terrible things happen at an organic and social level? To even attempt to comprehend suffering, we need a very long time horizon, a deep look into the workings of the universe—a galactic perspective.\n\nThe human species is radically unfinished, very incomplete. How young are we? On a 1-to-100 scale, are we 95% finished or 5%? I think we’re more like 5–10%. We just woke up—4,000 or 5,000 years ago—to the underlying level of consciousness recognized in the true religious traditions. This universe has been building this world for 3.7 billion years; we’re just waking up and learning to engage consciously rather than unconsciously.",

That transition was marked by an experience I call “the killing of the children.” I was an old woman confronting soldiers who were killing thousands of children, smashing their heads on rocks—terrible. I think that experience prepared me for the ocean of suffering phase. It awakened a depth of compassion, embedded at a soul level, to take on the work my soul had chosen in this lifetime. I learned that just as individual trauma gets buried in our psyche and compromises our health, the trauma of history is buried in the collective psyche of humanity. Anything not resolved by the species accumulates in massive memory structures I call metacoic systems. Something guiding my sessions began to use them to confront, absorb, and transmute vast territories of collective anguish embedded in the collective psyche—meaning the patient stopped being Chris Bache and, in some way, became an aspect of the human species.",

I want to be careful not to overemphasize the negative, though, because there’s a rhythm: purification, then ecstasy. The only thing that makes the purification bearable are the ecstatic blessings that follow. After processing the ocean of suffering, I’d also be integrating the gift of earlier unitive experiences—being taken on the “cosmic tour,” visiting the beginning of creation, and so on. This rhythm—of purification and blessing—kept pace throughout. The deeper the purification, the deeper the blessings. Once you learn that rhythm, you’re no longer afraid of purification; you seek it out. Not because you crave pain, but because you long for what lies beyond it.",

I have a different understanding when it comes to what I call the ocean of suffering. I don’t think everyone has to go into it. I don’t think everyone has to enter the hell realms or spend as long there as I did. People don’t need to be afraid that what I went through is a necessary part of any spiritual journey or cosmological exploration. I think my soul chose to do this before I was born. It manifested so quickly in my sessions after a couple of years, and it was such a tenacious, sustained part of my journey that I came to understand it as a soul’s choice. I say this without pride, because many beings today have made the same choice.",

How can we assert that there is intelligence, let alone compassion, in such a universe? To see the wisdom and the intelligence, we have to look very deep and very wide. On the surface, life can be a mean son of a bitch—cruel and vindictive—decimated by circumstances that crush the human heart.\n\nFrom a reincarnation perspective, our life did not begin with birth, and it does not end at death; our life is part of a larger story. Why someone would choose a life involving so much suffering may be impossible to answer from within a time-space perspective and from within an individual, almost centric perspective. To glimpse larger patterns, we have to open into a very large—evolutionary and spiritual—perspective.",

It was part of my karmic choice, not forced on me and not a tragedy—simply part of my life’s work. The universe more than rewarded me for this phase. Following the ocean of suffering—indeed within it and afterwards—it took me places and more than repaid me for taking it on.

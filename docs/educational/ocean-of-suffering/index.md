*Bache’s Sessions 11–17 move beyond personal therapy into a species-scale purification that opens—only after endurance—into “Deep Time.”*

## Curated weave (book-first)

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. […] *the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.*  
— **LSDMU ch.1 §8 ¶7**

He warns readers to expect something larger than personal healing. Sessions 11–17 inaugurate a phase he later names the *Ocean of Suffering*—difficult installments that nonetheless function like initiations.

> *The encounter with the ocean of suffering lasted fourteen sessions […] a year before the six-year break and a year after it […]. From the perspective of the experiences themselves, this six-year interruption was a mere bump in the road that changed nothing.*  
— **LSDMU ch.4 §0 ¶8**

At first, he misreads the ordeal as unfinished ego death; gradually, its scope reveals itself.

> *Accordingly, when the ocean of suffering opened […] I interpreted it to mean that some stubborn remnant of my ego […] was unfinished. […] Eventually I recognized that the death-rebirth cycle was repeating itself at deeper levels of consciousness.*  
— **LSDMU ch.6 §1 ¶2; ch.6 §1 ¶10** 

The work arrives in waves—tense anticipations, then hours-long purifications—separated by months to digest.

> *Once I learned what was waiting for me […] the mornings of a session day were tense. […] Carol called it “going into the tunnel.”*  
— **LSDMU ch.4 §0 ¶7**

As capacity grows, the field widens from personal to collective, then breaks through.

> *My consciousness was […] opening to more and more suffering […] tens of thousands of people. […] I reached more deeply into the suffering and eventually broke through to this larger dimension.*  
— **LSDMU ch.6 §0 ¶34**

What justifies such descent is what follows it.

> *The Ocean of Suffering was a terrible ordeal to endure, but each time I emerged from it I entered a reality […] where the rules of time had changed—into what I first called “whole time” and later Deep Time.*  
— **LSDMU ch.5 §0 ¶3**

And why suffering at all?

> *It’s not that the universe wants us to suffer […] there is a certain suffering inherent in repeatedly shedding our psychological skin in order to enter more deeply into the universe.*  
— **LSDMU ch.1 §12 ¶10**

> Beyond personal and soul-level unfinished business, you can encounter trauma that is species-wide. […] By letting humanity’s suffering enter full awareness, a transformation takes place that registers in the individual, but also—this is my hypothesis—registers in the species as a whole.

## Notes & synthesis
The book anchors the Ocean as a two-year, fourteen-session curriculum: installments of purification that reliably open into instruction (Deep Time). Transcripts confirm the mechanism (purification → ecstasy), the species-level intent, and the striking continuity across a six-year hiatus, while adding the “soul’s choice” nuance that this path is not prescriptive for all.

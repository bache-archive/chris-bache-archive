> And I address this in Lifecycles: human suffering brings us to our knees, and I don’t think we have an adequate understanding or explanation of it. In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.

> Just to add a little more about how I understand what happened in that 20-year journey—mind you, it would take all day to do it justice—the very short version is: in each one of those 73 journeys, the first two hours were, as you described in the book, sometimes exquisitely painful as you went through the difficult process of ego dissolution and beyond—letting go of any kind of identity, even as a human. And then what happened, as I recall, is that you broke out into what you have called the vast intelligences of the universe. Believe me, folks, this is no exaggeration—the kind of material that Chris brought back is absolutely stunning and absolutely relevant to what’s going on on the planet.

> The ocean of suffering lasted two years and 14 sessions, divided into one year of work, then a six-year break, then a resumption. After the break, the ocean of suffering picked up exactly where it had left off—six years later, with completely different life circumstances and astrological conditions. Nevertheless, my sessions began exactly where they had stopped, an indication of the intentionality of the intelligence guiding our work. After the break, the ecstatic portions began at a completely different place: what I came to call initiation into the universe. I was taken systematically by an intelligence that never adopted any form, but was intent on teaching me how the universe functions. It was cosmology 101.

> y fear—fear of dying, fear of loss. If you lose that fear of dying, you live from a different place.
> LSD and the Mind of the Universe is a psychedelic memoir—a whole life’s work. I like the title Diamonds from Heaven better because it’s a story of a journey of deepening intimacy. After sessions, even a grocery store can feel like Disneyland—strange and surreal. That’s our work: go into deeper intimacy with whatever drives the universe, then come back and live our lives as best we can. Reincarnation does this—pulling us out into spiritual reality, plunging us back in, over and over. A psychedelic session reenacts that on a smaller orbit: it shatters the earthly life, opens us to what it’s like to die into the great surrounding world, then we come back into time and space. Do that enough times—incarnate enough times—and you cease to relate to the world as before.

> s address suffering, often aiming to end it, but you write that we need to be open to our suffering.
> Chris Bache
> Let’s set the context. In a therapeutic modality with psychedelics, your system becomes hyperconscious for a time. When that happens, it spontaneously begins to cleanse itself. It brings forward the parts of your past you’ve struggled with—pain, fear, unfinished business. By confronting those fears and pains heroically, you can bring to resolution things that started in the past but never completed—ugly deaths, problematic relationships, and so on. Embracing the suffering that presents itself—letting it into awareness—allows it to move to a better outcome. The system relaxes, and you’re free to move into deeper levels of reality.
> 
> Early on, as consciousness expands beyond time-space, you may face ego death—the shattering of the identity formed in time-space. It’s painful, an inversion of everything you’ve known yourself to be, but in surrender, consciousness is liberated into deeper textures of mind. If you continue, you cycle through further purifications and deeper deaths, each followed by entry into deeper dimensions of reality, always working a particular edge.

> That is the question, and it's hard to summarize—it's taken me about 300 pages just to tell the story. There were so many layers. Basically, my experience has been that the universe—or the mind of the universe, or the mind of the divine—is an infinite ocean of potential. When we drop our individual mind into that ocean, it catalyzes experiences out of that infinite potential. As we are changed, influenced, healed, and purified by that exchange, the seed crystal of our mind changes. When we later drop that same, now-transformed mind into the ocean, it catalyzes a deeper set of experiences.

> a journey. The publisher wanted a more marketable title, and that’s LSD in the Mind of the Universe.
> The beginning of this book goes back over 40 years. In 1978, when I began graduate school, I encountered Stanislav Grof’s work. His book Realms of the Human Unconscious turned my life around, followed quickly by LSD Psychotherapy. He gave me the method and the confidence to explore my consciousness and, through that exploration, to come to know the deep psyche—the deep universe—better. I want to emphasize I did this work as a philosopher. I was not a therapist. I wasn’t primarily seeking healing—though healing did come—but seeking to understand our universe as deeply as I could by exploring my consciousness as deeply as I could.

> eally look forward to sharing the experiences I report in my book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe.
> David has framed our conversation as the question of whether we can all access the cosmic mind using psychedelics. I believe that we all can, but whether we all should is another matter entirely. In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.

> In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves. What’s important is the vision of the cosmos they contain, and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point we’re coming to.

> osophy of religion, not just for psychology, and I knew I wanted to get involved in doing this work.
> So even though LSD had been made illegal in 1970, I chose to conscientiously break the law and begin a series of rigorously structured sessions following Stan’s protocol. After three medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at high doses. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. I would be much gentler on myself if I were doing it over again, but at the time this is what I was doing to accelerate my own spiritual development. Quickly it evolved into engaging the deep structures of human evolution and trying to support humanity’s spiritual development, and then exploring this marvelous universe that we are part of.

> The circumstances were unusually stable, concentrated, and focused: the same sitter for years, same set and setting, intention, location (Northeast Ohio), substance, dose level, and the same recording process—always recording each session as completely as possible within 24 hours. When you stabilize your work—eliminate variables, use the same methodology consistently—it stabilizes the conversation between you and the creative intelligence of the universe. It stabilizes the communion so that one session leads to the next in a coherent, intelligent manner. You may not understand the continuity as it unfolds, but over time you see patterns and feel you’re engaging a single creative intelligence. I say that carefully—there are many layers and forms of intelligence—but across sessions the continuity is unmistakable.

> ing deeper requires yet another cycle of complete surrender to enter the initiation available there.
> Working with high doses of LSD has been compared to a nuclear bomb. The bomb and LSD were both created in the same decade. A long, sustained series of psychedelic experiences, focused therapeutically, triggers a sustained “nuclear explosion”—not only de‑structuring reality as you’ve known it, but exposing deeper levels that were always there but invisible until this explosion brought them into awareness. We’re not talking about bombs, of course; we’re talking about this beautiful universe: 100 billion galaxies, billions of stars in the Milky Way. I’ll use that as backdrop to touch on turning points in my journey and levels of reality I entered.

> g mistakes, and likewise the supreme intelligence of the universe would not do that to human beings.
> Now, as you know from my book LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I spent many years entering hell realms—experiencing extreme torture that looks like a hell realm. My eventual understanding is this: just as my individual psyche retains all my memories, good and traumatic, there is a consciousness of the human species that retains all of its memories and processes them in a central meta-psychological condition—what Jung called the collective unconscious. That means all the terrible things human beings have done to each other—all the wars, horrors, injustices, rapes, pillaging—to the extent they have not been clarified or healed, become part of the collective torment, the collective shadow of humanity. You might say that within the human psyche there are clusters of memories with a hellish quality. But that doesn’t mean there is a cosmological state of eternal hell, because just as individuals can clear bad experiences from their system, the human species can clear terrible trauma from its system. I think that in the early Church, some who had contact with these collective hellish realms mistakenly interpreted them as a cosmological principle of eternal hell.

> LSD and the Mind of the Universe is the memoir of a psychedelic explorer. It is the story of one person’s journey into the mind of the cosmos. I’ve tried to tell this story as concisely as I can, focusing on the journey itself and keeping theoretical discussion to a minimum. I will rely on other authors to give the reader the history and science of psychedelics, their psychopharmacology, and their clinical applications. I share my psychedelic experiences here not because I think they are special or unique, for they are not, but because, all things considered, they are the most valuable gift I have to offer the psychedelic conversation.

LSD and the Mind of the Universe is its outer title, describing what the book is about—exploring the mind of the universe through carefully conducted LSD sessions. Diamonds from Heaven is its inner title, describing its innermost essence, for at the center of the mind of the universe, one enters the infinite clear light of Diamond Luminosity.

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.5 §0 ¶3 (5 · 0)**

> The Ocean of Suffering was a terrible ordeal to endure, but each time I emerged from it I entered a reality that was stunning and intoxicating—a domain where the rules of time had changed. When I returned to my ordinary consciousness after each of these sessions, I had to ask myself: “Are these experiences real? Did what I think just happened actually happen?” The answer was always the same: “Yes, this is real. This is true.” But how? Inside space-time, we divide our experience into past, present, and future. The past is memory, the present is real, the future is projection. Inside these seven sessions, however, past, present, and future merged into a different experience of time—into what I first called “whole time” and later *Deep Time*.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶10 (1 · 12)**

> So why, then, is there so much suffering in this story? It’s not that the universe wants us to suffer as the price of knowing her; it’s that there is a certain suffering inherent in repeatedly shedding our psychological skin in order to enter more deeply into the universe.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §0 ¶8 (4 · 0)**

> The encounter with the ocean of suffering lasted fourteen sessions spread over two years of work. This work was coherent from beginning to end despite the fact that I stopped my sessions for six years in the middle of this series, for reasons I will explain in the next chapter. From the perspective of the experiences themselves, this six-year interruption was a mere bump in the road that changed nothing. But in terms of calendar time, there was a year of the ocean of suffering before the six-year break and a year after it, each containing seven sessions.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §0 ¶3 (7 · 0)**

> When the ocean of suffering reached its explosive culmination in the 24th session, I crossed into a reality that was ancient beyond reckoning. Even more striking than its age was the fact that it felt more “real” than physical reality. This was unnerving at first. We are not accustomed to thinking of reality as something that admits of degrees. Either something is real or it’s not real. And yet, each time I left my ordinary consciousness and entered this domain, I had the distinct sensation of moving from the less real to the more real. In one session I wrote, “*It jars my soul to realize how watered down reality is inside space-time*.” Like the prisoner freed from Plato’s cave, I had entered a deeper order of reality. I had entered the greater real of archetypal reality.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)**

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §0 ¶79 (8 · 0)**

> I saw that there was a direct correlation between the scope of the pain cleansed in the ocean of suffering and the magnitude of the Light that is beginning to explode inside me now. By immersing myself in the collective fabric of humanity, by taking on its pain and drawing its poison out of the human system, my being is now beginning to spontaneously manifest the higher energy that is emerging in history. Today I sensed that this Light will be coming into me over many sessions still to come but that it is somehow already present, already “won” through that cleansing. Something that is waiting for me when I die is beginning to work its way into my embodied consciousness on Earth. I feel so deeply grateful to have been given the opportunity to take on as much suffering as I have. (Session 43)"

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶2 (6 · 1)**

> When I began this work, I was thinking in terms of a model of transformation that held that the purpose of undergoing these exercises was to heal and enlighten the *individual*. When Grof discussed the therapeutic impact of psychedelic therapy, he always focused on how it affected the individual patient, and occasionally the patient’s significant partner. When he reflected on how this therapeutic movement might influence the emerging global crisis, he did so in terms of the cumulative impact of healing large numbers of people one person at a time. Accordingly, when the ocean of suffering opened after what had appeared to be a solid ego-death in sessions 9 and 10, I interpreted it to mean that some stubborn remnant of my ego must have slipped through the therapeutic net and that my ego-death was unfinished. I thought that this collective suffering would eventually lead to a more complete ego-death.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.4 §0 ¶7 (4 · 0)**

> I think it’s better to bundle these early experiences of the ocean of suffering together rather than take you through them session by entire session. Concentrating them into a few pages, however, may make them appear worse than they actually were, if that’s possible. In actual practice, the ocean of suffering was broken up into installments lasting a few hours each and separated by months in which I had time to digest them and prepare myself for the next round. Once I learned what was waiting for me inside the sessions, the mornings of a session day were tense. Like a woman going into labor or a soldier going into battle, my attention turned deeply within as I prepared for what was about to happen. Carol called it “going into the tunnel.” It would start hours, sometimes days before a session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶34 (6 · 0)**

> My consciousness was expanding and opening to more and more suffering. Eventually, I had the sense that my being stretched from horizon to horizon as I experienced a suffering that involved tens of thousands of people. Because I had gone into this state more slowly this time, it was not as confusing as before. Then I caught a glimpse of something behind the field of suffering, something enormous and familiar from the previous session. I reached more deeply into the suffering and eventually broke through to this larger dimension.

> At the end of chapter 6, I asked: If a person can take on the suffering of others at the subtle level of consciousness and relieve that suffering to some degree, why does the suffering ever cease for an individual while it still continues for the speciesmind as a whole? This session answers this question. The work of draining poisons out of the collective psyche from “below” is followed by pouring blessings into it from “above.” When we move into levels of reality beyond the species-mind, we do not abandon humanity, but rather we become more useful to humanity by acting on it from a higher position.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §0 ¶128 (6 · 0)**

> Because of the master story I had been given in these two sessions, I returned to the psychedelic arena three months later with a clearer sense of the landscape I was entering. Things were beginning to make more sense to me now: why my personal transformation had been supplanted by the work of collective transformation, why the killing of the children, why the ocean of suffering. Seeing that humanity was entering a critical phase of its evolutionary journey helped me understand why I had refused to abandon creation in session 18 despite the pleasures available to me in spiritual reality. Having been reunited with the forces and intention of creation, I saw more clearly what was happening in history and the role I was being asked to play in this unfolding. All of this came to a head in the next session when the ocean of suffering reached its peak. Perhaps because the collective ordeal was coming to its culmination, this session began in the quiet beginnings of my life, as if to recapitulate and clarify the entire progression.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §2 ¶1 (6 · 2)**

> Let me conclude this chapter by taking up a question that I asked in the closing pages of *Dark Night, Early Dawn*. If the individual and the species are as deeply interwoven in these sessions as I have suggested, why does the collective suffering end for an individual even though it continues for the species as a whole? If we can open to the suffering of others in our psychedelic sessions and impact that suffering to some degree, how does it happen that the individual ever completes his or her work at this level while the suffering of the species-mind continues?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §12 ¶1 (1 · 12)**

> Let me bring this chapter to a close by addressing a final important issue. The single largest concern I have about sharing my visionary journey with others is that people may be frightened by the large amount of suffering it contains. I am concerned that they will either judge the psychedelic method harshly or become fearful of the unseen universe. Both of these are the last things I want to happen. In order to avoid this, I have considered blunting the pain and diluting its role in the plot, but this would be dishonest. I may make mistakes in telling this story, but I pledge to give an honest account of what took place in my sessions. It is important, therefore, that we understand the role that suffering plays in the psychedelic process, and specifically the suffering of death and rebirth. It’s also important that I own the fact that some of this suffering came from my personal decision to push myself as hard as I did.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.6 §1 ¶10 (6 · 1)**

> At the present time, however, I have shifted to what I think is a simpler and more elegant way of understanding the ocean of suffering. I now see death and rebirth as a cycle that repeats many times as we move into progressively deeper levels of consciousness. Being an archetypal cycle, any single death-rebirth experience may incorporate material from multiple levels of consciousness. But looking back over the trajectory of all my sessions, I now recognize that the death-rebirth cycle was repeating itself in different forms at different levels of consciousness. The image below may help convey this point.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶2 (8 · 1)**

> As I write this account many years later, the larger arc of my sessions up to this point feels clear to me. Two years of intense physical and psychological purification had ended in my ego being turned inside out and broken open. Then the deeper work had begun, the work chosen by my soul before I was born. I stayed in the ocean of suffering for two years, draining rage and violence out of the collective human psyche. For this I received two gifts: experiencing the whole of my life from beginning to end and then being taken deep into the splendor of our universe. When the ocean of suffering ended, I was catapulted for a year and a half into archetypal reality and the collective fields of humanity. And now the blessings of Oneness, the Diamond Soul, the Fertile Void, and Cosmic Love.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.7 §0 ¶4 (7 · 0)**

> The next year and a half was a choppy and complex period. The cleansing continued to be fierce, so much so that at first I thought the ocean of suffering had not yet ended, but in time I came to recognize that something had changed. I was no longer being taken into vast tracts of human history. The ecstatic portions of these eleven sessions were also complex. I was repeatedly entering what felt to be archetypal reality, but it was not the world of archetypes described by either Plato or Carl Jung—or it was and it wasn’t. I saw parallels to the work of these thinkers in my experience but also differences. And there were many levels to this territory, some far removed from physical existence and some operating deep within it. Reality functioned differently in this domain, requiring new concepts and new ways of thinking. All these factors make the next eleven sessions hard to summarize.

John Dupuy:
You talk in the book about how you came to understand that the hell realms—the suffering realms you had to visit—were for your benefit, for purification, preparing you for revelation.

Chris Bache:
It’s complicated. It took me about two and a half years to go through what Stan Grof calls the perinatal dimension of consciousness—very intense physical and emotional purifications, which eventually ended in ego death, being shattered, my entire physical identity turned inside out. Then the ocean of suffering began. At first I thought it was a deeper form of personal suffering, a deeper form of ego death. Eventually—and this is why I wrote Dark Night, Early Dawn at core, to solve the riddle of why the suffering got as large as it did—I concluded it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation at all. It was aimed at healing the human species.

> stantiation of the universe—every life, the ones that suffer and the ones that don't suffer as much.
Chris Bache
And I address this in Lifecycles: human suffering brings us to our knees, and I don’t think we have an adequate understanding or explanation of it. In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and encountered the intelligence behind this process, I find myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re brought to our knees trying to grasp it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives confidence that there truly is a logic to it. And I want to say: the universe is a hard taskmaster. Look at images of Kali the destroyer—she brings death and destruction in one hand and enlightenment in the other. These things go together. There is nothing easy or gentle about the love of the universe or the love of the Divine. It is a fierce place we are part of, a very demanding world. But the question is: does the universe, in a deeper sense, pay attention to our pain? Is there a way in which, by engaging our pain as conscientiously as we can, it leads to our development in the long term? Is the universe listening to us in our pain? I think it is. I think it is an intentional process, even though I can’t answer your question satisfactorily.

> ain and suffering to reach deeper levels of consciousness. Can you share what that was like for you?
Chris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had. You lose yourself, enter communion with the universe, and when you come back you gather the experiences, and my personality synthesizes and integrates them. It’s a pulsing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.

> y of contrast and suffering as essential conditions for learning and growth in the human experience?
Chris Bache:
Great question. The question of suffering is profound; we could spend the whole program on it. If the creative intelligence is intelligent and loving, how could it have tolerated—let alone manifested—a world so painful, where terrible things happen at an organic and social level? To even attempt to comprehend suffering, we need a very long time horizon, a deep look into the workings of the universe—a galactic perspective.

The human species is radically unfinished, very incomplete. How young are we? On a 1-to-100 scale, are we 95% finished or 5%? I think we’re more like 5–10%. We just woke up—4,000 or 5,000 years ago—to the underlying level of consciousness recognized in the true religious traditions. This universe has been building this world for 3.7 billion years; we’re just waking up and learning to engage consciously rather than unconsciously.

> us what that body of collective memory felt like and looked like to you, because we’re still in it.
Chris Bache:
My transition from an ego-death process, which is very personal, led into two years of excruciatingly difficult waves—vast landscapes of human suffering: war, violence, unimaginable anguish. That transition was marked by an experience I call “the killing of the children.” I was an old woman confronting soldiers who were killing thousands of children, smashing their heads on rocks—terrible. I think that experience prepared me for the ocean of suffering phase. It awakened a depth of compassion, embedded at a soul level, to take on the work my soul had chosen in this lifetime. I learned that just as individual trauma gets buried in our psyche and compromises our health, the trauma of history is buried in the collective psyche of humanity. Anything not resolved by the species accumulates in massive memory structures I call metacoic systems. Something guiding my sessions began to use them to confront, absorb, and transmute vast territories of collective anguish embedded in the collective psyche—meaning the patient stopped being Chris Bache and, in some way, became an aspect of the human species.

Chris Bache:
And I address this in Lifecycles: human suffering brings us to our knees, and I don't think we have an adequate understanding or explanation of it. In my experience, when I’ve been drawn into a larger overview and experienced the intelligence behind this process, I’ve found myself trusting beyond what I can understand. I trust because of the quality of the being I encounter behind these circumstances. I can’t understand all the pain behind all this. I can come up with any number of partial and incomplete theories for how it works, but in the end we’re ultimately brought to our knees trying to understand it intellectually. If you experience the love and wisdom of the universe, it gives you confidence that there truly is a logic to it.

> the level of challenge the same, just with a greater psychic scale, or did it get easier over time?
Chris Bache
The ocean of suffering was much harder and more demanding than dissolving my personal ego—truly a different order of magnitude. I want to be careful not to overemphasize the negative, though, because there’s a rhythm: purification, then ecstasy. The only thing that makes the purification bearable are the ecstatic blessings that follow. After processing the ocean of suffering, I’d also be integrating the gift of earlier unitive experiences—being taken on the “cosmic tour,” visiting the beginning of creation, and so on. This rhythm—of purification and blessing—kept pace throughout. The deeper the purification, the deeper the blessings. Once you learn that rhythm, you’re no longer afraid of purification; you seek it out. Not because you crave pain, but because you long for what lies beyond it.

Chris Bache
I understand the teaching, and it reflects certain aspects of the journey. I’m not sure it reflects this particular aspect in a satisfying way. I have a different understanding when it comes to what I call the ocean of suffering. I don’t think everyone has to go into it. I don’t think everyone has to enter the hell realms or spend as long there as I did. People don’t need to be afraid that what I went through is a necessary part of any spiritual journey or cosmological exploration. I think my soul chose to do this before I was born. It manifested so quickly in my sessions after a couple of years, and it was such a tenacious, sustained part of my journey that I came to understand it as a soul’s choice. I say this without pride, because many beings today have made the same choice.

> country with disease and conflict—how does a reincarnation perspective grapple with those realities?
Chris Bache:
Terrible suffering—babies born without a neocortex, anencephalic children; babies born into violent circumstances, destined to die after a very short life with terrible pain. How can we assert that there is intelligence, let alone compassion, in such a universe? To see the wisdom and the intelligence, we have to look very deep and very wide. On the surface, life can be a mean son of a bitch—cruel and vindictive—decimated by circumstances that crush the human heart.

From a reincarnation perspective, our life did not begin with birth, and it does not end at death; our life is part of a larger story. Why someone would choose a life involving so much suffering may be impossible to answer from within a time-space perspective and from within an individual, almost centric perspective. To glimpse larger patterns, we have to open into a very large—evolutionary and spiritual—perspective.

> Coming back to your explorations, you use the phrase “deep time.” Can you say what you mean by that?
Chris Bache:
When I first began to enter the ocean of suffering—after ego death, moving into episodes of collective anguish—each session tended to divide into two halves: a purification half followed by an ecstatic half. If you submit to the purification, it crescendos to a breakthrough and then you’re spun into a transpersonal section of ecstatic teachings.

Aviv Shahar:
We’ll get further into both the divine reality and the cycles of death and rebirth. But just to pick up where you started—the sense of suffering you described—stepping back, what do you understand to be the significance of suffering in the evolutionary process? Why is suffering part of evolution?

Chris Bache:
That really is a core question, isn’t it? It’s deep, and hard to answer without preparing the ground, so I’ll take shortcuts and ask your listeners’ indulgence. During the same period of the cosmic tour—when I was being given a crash course in Cosmology 101—I was taken back to what appeared to be the beginning of creation itself, the beginning of time and space, and I experienced an overwhelming love saturating me. It was a cosmic love. Then I witnessed the birth of space and time and all of evolution taking place inside this love, held and guided by it.

> t you, Chris. To keep coming back as it shifts from an individual quest to everybody and everything.
Chris Bache:
It may be largely a function of my choice to work with very high doses that blow you deeply into the structure of reality. Not everyone may enter these domains. Over the course of my journey I learned this was a task my soul took on before I was born. It was part of my karmic choice, not forced on me and not a tragedy—simply part of my life’s work. The universe more than rewarded me for this phase. Following the ocean of suffering—indeed within it and afterwards—it took me places and more than repaid me for taking it on. As always, whenever you do anything for others, the universe has no choice but to give back to you—because it acts out of oneness. If we do something for others, it comes back in one form or another.

> ack and bring your wisdom here. A lot of imagination is needed when we enter this kind of territory.
Chris Bache:
Yes, very much. With reincarnation, you have to live with it for a long time and bring the questions people are asking into that paradigm, then sit with it to get intimations of the depth of how it recontextualizes the way we usually think. Here’s a question by Jacqueline that really stretches us: how can collective suffering be a creative process rooted in cosmic love? That’s a hard question, because of the sheer scale. It’s hard even for an individual life: how is suffering in our life compatible with the idea that the universe is compassionate and loving? At a collective level—of the type we were talking about in our third dialog, our coming challenging period of history—how can suffering of that magnitude be a creative process rooted in cosmic love?

> deaths, each followed by entry into deeper dimensions of reality, always working a particular edge.
Beyond personal and soul-level unfinished business, you can encounter trauma that is species-wide. In my chapter “The Ocean of Suffering,” after ego death and going deeper, I was drawn into vast fields of human suffering—terrible anger, torture, pain. It continued for two years. At first I thought it was refining my ego death, but eventually I realized it wasn’t aimed at my personal transformation. It was aimed at transforming my entire human family. In these sessions, consciousness had expanded far beyond “Chris Bache.” It was as if I were the species, remembering and reliving the species’ pain. By letting humanity’s suffering enter full awareness, a transformation takes place that registers in the individual, but also—this is my hypothesis—registers in the species as a whole. Just as individuals carry scars from trauma, the species carries scars from all the terrible things we’ve done to each other, held in the collective psyche.

> t life and how it’s being lived by the other creatures on this Earth we share. It’s really powerful.
Chris Bache: I agree. The first thing that came into my mind was: take some suffering out of the world. Look at our lives—how we’re impacting and causing suffering—and take it out, not only between human beings, leading toward a gentler, clearer life, but also toward other species. In Buddhist practice, the first thing you do when you begin any meditation is cultivate bodhicitta, the aspiration to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for yourself. The last thing you do is the distribution of merit: you give away all the merit generated to all levels of being. This shatters the illusion of individual enlightenment. It’s not about personal transformation; it’s about collective transformation.

Terrible, terrible suffering—babies born without a neocortex, babies born into violent circumstances, destined to die after a very short life with terrible pain. How can we assert intelligence, let alone compassion, in such a universe? To see the wisdom and intelligence, we have to look very deep and very wide. On the surface, life can be cruel—decimated by circumstances that crush the human heart. From a reincarnation perspective, our life did not begin at birth and does not end at death; it’s part of a larger story. Why someone would choose a life with so much suffering may be impossible to answer from within time-space and an individual perspective. To glimpse larger patterns, we have to open to a very large evolutionary and spiritual perspective.

Most important, I think, is understanding that all our suffering is preserved, conserved, and used. All human suffering is experienced by the Divine. There is no Divine outside human suffering watching us. Everything humanity suffers—everything the animal kingdom suffers—the spiritual world suffers at a very deep level.

Maybe the difference is biological and socially transmitted trauma passed from parent to child versus the Soul—capital S—as the collection of awareness across multiple reincarnated lifetimes. Does that resonate?

Chris Bache:
Potentially, yes. One day we’ll understand this much more. We’re at the edge—collecting phenomenology. Interpreting this complex new terrain will take time.

> ory loss; but by returning over and over, cognition, perception, understanding, and recall improved.
The ocean of suffering lasted two years and 14 sessions, divided into one year of work, then a six-year break, then a resumption. After the break, the ocean of suffering picked up exactly where it had left off—six years later, with completely different life circumstances and astrological conditions. Nevertheless, my sessions began exactly where they had stopped, an indication of the intentionality of the intelligence guiding our work. After the break, the ecstatic portions began at a completely different place: what I came to call initiation into the universe. I was taken systematically by an intelligence that never adopted any form, but was intent on teaching me how the universe functions. It was cosmology 101.

> s address suffering, often aiming to end it, but you write that we need to be open to our suffering.
Chris Bache
Let’s set the context. In a therapeutic modality with psychedelics, your system becomes hyperconscious for a time. When that happens, it spontaneously begins to cleanse itself. It brings forward the parts of your past you’ve struggled with—pain, fear, unfinished business. By confronting those fears and pains heroically, you can bring to resolution things that started in the past but never completed—ugly deaths, problematic relationships, and so on. Embracing the suffering that presents itself—letting it into awareness—allows it to move to a better outcome. The system relaxes, and you’re free to move into deeper levels of reality.

Early on, as consciousness expands beyond time-space, you may face ego death—the shattering of the identity formed in time-space. It’s painful, an inversion of everything you’ve known yourself to be, but in surrender, consciousness is liberated into deeper textures of mind. If you continue, you cycle through further purifications and deeper deaths, each followed by entry into deeper dimensions of reality, always working a particular edge.

> rough cycles of death and rebirth, their significance, and how they facilitate collective awakening.
Chris Bache:
First, what I’m going to describe is my variation on an ancient Buddhist teaching. When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired. In mature spiritual practice, everything is for the benefit of the whole.

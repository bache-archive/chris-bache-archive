      <p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §3 ¶4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §7 ¶2</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶4</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It takes time to integrate such experiences and make them truly one’s own. Time and sharing. In his beautiful book on near-death experiences, Consciousness Beyond Life, Pim van Lommel describes the challenges that people face as they attempt to integrate their experience of transcendence into their daily lives. There he writes, “The process of integration cannot get under way properly until the experience can be shared.” This is true for deep psychedelic experience as well. In my case at least, there was a level of integration that took place before sharing my story with others and a deeper level that has opened as I have been writing this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.12 §2 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Integration is not just a psychological process; it is also a social process. When you do deep psychedelic work in a culture that is hostile to psychedelics or even just naive about them, you inevitably separate yourself from your friends and neighbors. Because it is not possible to share this important part of your life with them, your relationships grow thinner. You can enter into their world, but they cannot enter into yours. Even if they are open to the psychedelic conversation, unless they have been psychedelically initiated themselves, the discussion soon falters. It’s no one’s fault, but as a result of this invisible boundary, you become less authentic in their presence, less your full self. Again Carl Jung spoke for me when he wrote, “Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.” Of the many things I had anticipated in undertaking this journey, the personal cost of this loneliness was the most unexpected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶5</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶3</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4</strong> <em>(optional)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. […] <em>An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine.</em> […]</p>

<p>…how does one integrate that? As long as you’re still within time and space… we have therapeutic models… If you go deeper… we have spiritual models… But when our journeys take us great distances… how are those experiences integrated in us?<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/L3D_fSr75u8?t=4517">01:15:17</a> — <em>Mapping Consciousness with High-Dose LSD (ATTMind #83)</em> (2018-10-12) • 01:15:17</p>
<p>First, I think integration is very important… I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey… the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences…<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/q-caGhIlKS8?t=689">00:11:29</a> — <em>The Phoenix Always Rises: Evolving into the Future Human</em> (2025-01-08) • 00:11:29</p>
<p>Integrating these experiences is a lifelong undertaking… In the 20 years after I stopped… we’re just scratching the surface… when we go really deep… how are those experiences integrated in us?<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FEQ8ony19sk?t=5735">01:35:35</a> — <em>Reach Truth Podcast</em> (2022-08-30) • 01:35:35</p>
<p>…record as carefully as we can… then take care of ourselves as we integrate it… It took me a year to recover from the session about the birth of the future human… Practice the arts of grounding…<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/AyMBQMGaIeA?t=3920">01:05:20</a> — <em>What 73 High-Dose LSD Sessions Taught Christopher Bache</em> (2023-12-05) • 01:05:20</p>
<p>The first step of integration is an accurate phenomenological description… Integration is the foundation of future sessions… there’s a circle: you open, then you integrate… which lays the foundation for a deeper opening…<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/FMgixG6Z0sk?t=811">00:13:31</a> — <em>Psychedelics and the Cosmic Mind</em> (2025-03-18) • 00:13:31</p>
<p>All my sessions were recorded within 24 hours… about 400 pages of notes… years to piece together the storyline—and decide what to leave out and what to include.<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.inbodiedlife.com/blog/chris-bache">00:57:51</a> — <em>Learning to be Gods…</em> (2023-06-30) • 00:57:51</p>
<p>The last chapter… “Coming Off the Mountain”… I found a deep existential longing to return… I learned that integrating a session is different than integrating an entire journey… It took years—about ten years—to get grounded back in space-time reality…<br />
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/B0BhUOEP1Mg?t=5587">01:33:07</a> — <em>Bicycle Day Conversation with Jef Baker</em> (2020-04-19) • 01:33:07</p>
<p>There’s a question I ask in the book: <em>What is the value of true but temporary knowledge?</em> …The idea of bringing them back and integrating them as a stable state… for some of the deeper experiences it’s not possible—at least not at my present level…<br />

They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.",

Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric.

Even if they are open to the psychedelic conversation, unless they have been psychedelically initiated themselves, the discussion soon falters. It’s no one’s fault, but as a result of this invisible boundary, you become less authentic in their presence, less your full self.

You get brought right back to your cushion.\n\nTom Habib: The journey continues.\n\nChris Bache: The journey continues.\n\nTom Habib: This is a good place to end the formal session. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Chris, where can people find more information and your books?\n\nChris Bache: My website—chrisbache.com. It’s a bit unfinished—my web designer jumped ship about three-fourths of the way through—but it’s there, and you can reach me through it.",

        "text": "get enough light from the other side. It just is. We accept that more easily than we do with people.\nChris Bache: Exciting times we live in. I know we’re coming towards the end, so I want to mention something. The last chapter of my book is called “Coming Off the Mountain,” and I discuss what happened when I stopped my sessions—the years after I stopped. I mention this because it’s getting easier with the substances available to us to break through consciousness, to break into intimacy with the universe, to break into transcendence, to access information. My experience was that when I stopped my sessions, I thought that since I’d been given so many gifts and had so many mystical experiences and experiences of intimacy with the being of existence—dissolving into the primordial light—I thought it would be easy to stop and be nourished by those experiences. What I found was a deep existential longing to return to those dimensions. I knew I had to stop for reasons I explain in the book. I came to a point where I knew I needed to stop and slow things down, and I knew when I stopped that I would never go back into such intimacy with the divine during my lifetime. It would only happen with death—that I would return to such depth of place. I found myself slowly entering a condition where I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children, teaching my classes, doing the things I do, but in my heart of hearts I was just waiting for this life to be over so I could return to the full intimacy of the divine. In time I realized this is not right. This is not the way this work is supposed to end. I had been so careful to integrate every session and not get ahead of myself that it wasn’t clear where I had gone wrong. My life was screaming “failure to integrate,” but it wasn’t clear how I’d failed, because I had paid so much attention to integration. I learned that integrating a session is different than integrating an entire journey. My journey had taken me so deeply into transcendence that I lost my footing in the world of immanence. It’s all the divine—the physical world is the divine—but I had gone so deep into the transcendent divine that I lost my footing inside the immanent divine. It took years—about ten years—to get grounded back in space-time reality so that I could live the remainder of my years within the joy of space-time reality. I mention this because as more people have experiences of transcendence, we naturally want to go there, or let there come in here more completely. It’s really important to address integration while we are going into these states—integrate, integrate, integrate. Integrating a journey is different than integrating individual sessions. It’s a delicate process. I mention my own mistakes to encourage other people not to make those mistakes.",

All my sessions were recorded within 24 hours. I had about 400 pages of notes, which I studied, blocked, took apart, reassembled, diagrammed in different ways. It took years to piece together the storyline—and decide what to leave out and what to include. I left out a lot of the personal healings and small personal things because those weren’t the important parts for this book. Everyone has a personal story; as a philosopher, the story becomes interesting when the process takes you beyond the personal psyche into the deep waters of the psyche.",

There’s a book just published called Psychedelics and Psychotherapy that focuses on integration. I have an article in it. We’re getting past the stage where the excitement over breaking through to these dimensions of consciousness dominates. We’re beginning to realize the real issue is: What do we do with these experiences? How can we hold them? How do we integrate them individually and in small communities? How do we integrate them intellectually so we shift the paradigm we live within?\n\nPsychedelic experiences support the paradigm of a living universe—not dead matter, but a universe that is alive, with orders and orders and orders of intelligence behind and within physical existence. There are many levels to it. I would offer my own experiences as some of what not to do. I’m deadly serious when I say I pushed myself harder than was wise at the end. The hardest chapter to write was the last one, “Coming Off the Mountain,” where I reflect on the years after I stopped my sessions. It took me a year just to write it.",

It raises substantial intellectual questions: how do you possibly integrate experiences that so radically transcend the conditions of time and space and our consciousness inside time and space? If you have temporary experiences that go radically beyond spatial consciousness and linear time, what does it even mean to integrate them? What does integration look like when you’re dealing with such radical experiences? With lower-dose work or gentler psychedelics, where experiences come closer to your world inside time and space, integration is less demanding. But if you really open the very deep waters of the psyche, integration becomes a more substantive issue.\n\nEmmy Vadnais:\nWe’re getting lots of questions. This one from Robert Bushman might be a good place to start: What is consciousness? Is there an ultimate reality, or is it infinitely fractal? How can an individual’s conscious awareness expand without psychedelics? How can one remember past lives? Maybe starting with: what is consciousness?",

Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning.

There seems to be a suggestion in your language—a quality of return. “I want to return to the Beloved. I want to return to the Light.” I’m wondering how we can play with that alongside decimating the notion of path itself. Is “return” a provisional description, and a more absolute approach would be recognition and self-liberation? That is, you don’t need to return to anything—the issue is removing the cataracts of confusion, opening the aperture of heart and mind, and the Light, the Mother, is right here now. Does that speak to you when you reference longing to return to the Mother, the Beloved, the Clear Light? That denotes a subtle dualism—“I have to return”—versus “No, I just recognize.”",

I don’t doubt that any of the experiences I had were true, and I also know they were temporary. I cannot live in those places. The idea of bringing them back and integrating them as a stable state may be true for certain levels of experience, but for some of the deeper experiences it’s not possible—at least not at my present level of psycho-spiritual development.

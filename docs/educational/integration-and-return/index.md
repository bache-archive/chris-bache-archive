> The circumstances were unusually stable, concentrated, and focused: the same sitter for years, same set and setting, intention, location (Northeast Ohio), substance, dose level, and the same recording process—always recording each session as completely as possible within 24 hours. When you stabilize your work—eliminate variables, use the same methodology consistently—it stabilizes the conversation between you and the creative intelligence of the universe. It stabilizes the communion so that one session leads to the next in a coherent, intelligent manner. You may not understand the continuity as it unfolds, but over time you see patterns and feel you’re engaging a single creative intelligence. I say that carefully—there are many layers and forms of intelligence—but across sessions the continuity is unmistakable.

And then what happened, as I recall, is that you broke out into what you have called the vast intelligences of the universe. Believe me, folks, this is no exaggeration—the kind of material that Chris brought back is absolutely stunning and absolutely relevant to what’s going on on the planet.

> David has framed our conversation as the question of whether we can all access the cosmic mind using psychedelics. I believe that we all can, but whether we all should is another matter entirely. In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.

> In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves. What’s important is the vision of the cosmos they contain, and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point we’re coming to.

> y fear—fear of dying, fear of loss. If you lose that fear of dying, you live from a different place.
> LSD and the Mind of the Universe is a psychedelic memoir—a whole life’s work. I like the title Diamonds from Heaven better because it’s a story of a journey of deepening intimacy. After sessions, even a grocery store can feel like Disneyland—strange and surreal. That’s our work: go into deeper intimacy with whatever drives the universe, then come back and live our lives as best we can. Reincarnation does this—pulling us out into spiritual reality, plunging us back in, over and over. A psychedelic session reenacts that on a smaller orbit: it shatters the earthly life, opens us to what it’s like to die into the great surrounding world, then we come back into time and space. Do that enough times—incarnate enough times—and you cease to relate to the world as before.

> So even though LSD had been made illegal in 1970, I chose to conscientiously break the law and begin a series of rigorously structured sessions following Stan’s protocol. After three medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at high doses. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. I would be much gentler on myself if I were doing it over again, but at the time this is what I was doing to accelerate my own spiritual development. Quickly it evolved into engaging the deep structures of human evolution and trying to support humanity’s spiritual development, and then exploring this marvelous universe that we are part of.

> I was on this journey for 20 years, then processed the experiences for another 20 before releasing LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I thought coming off the mountain would be straightforward. I was wrong—it was very demanding. In some ways it was as difficult as going up. Spirit said to me, there is the dying of seeing and the dying of keeping. The dying of seeing happens as you enter deeper states; the dying of keeping is integration. I was integrating all along, but integrating an entire journey is different than integrating individual sessions. It took a long time.

> Another thing that made it hard to come back was our society’s rules that we can’t talk about these things. I’m a teacher; I love to teach, but I couldn’t teach from this knowledge. I couldn’t share it. Writing LSD and the Mind of the Universe has been a very satisfying part of integrating my work—publicly owning my experiences and beginning to teach on the basis of them. And not just my experiences—if they weren’t supported by others in the psychedelic community, they’d amount to nothing. But I’m part of a movement, and there’s tremendous coherence in it. We’re entering into the systematic integration of psychedelics into our culture. That’s the exciting part—the teaching moment.

> I don’t do high-dose LSD work anymore. I’ve done low-dose sessions and some work with ayahuasca, psilocybin, and other things. After I finished my major sessions, in meditation the universe said to me, “Twenty years in, twenty years out,” which I took to mean it would take about 20 years to integrate 20 years of sessions. At the time I thought, “About right.” Now I think I was naive. I underestimated how many years—how many incarnations—it would take to internalize them.

I’m nowhere near done integrating those pieces.

> Chris Bache:
> That is the question, and it's hard to summarize—it's taken me about 300 pages just to tell the story. There were so many layers. Basically, my experience has been that the universe—or the mind of the universe, or the mind of the divine—is an infinite ocean of potential. When we drop our individual mind into that ocean, it catalyzes experiences out of that infinite potential. As we are changed, influenced, healed, and purified by that exchange, the seed crystal of our mind changes. When we later drop that same, now-transformed mind into the ocean, it catalyzes a deeper set of experiences.

One is Dark Night, Early Dawn, which came out in 2000, and probably the more important one for a wide audience is LSD in the Mind of the Universe, which came out in 2019. So I did this work for 20 years, and then LSD in the Mind of the Universe came out 20 years after I stopped.

You physically couldn't speak because you couldn't speak of what you understood and what you knew. Can you tell us a little about that? That seemed to me quite an integral part of what was happening.

> you unpick a bit of the structure you see as useful for helping us move toward being future humans?
Chris Bache
There are several things rolled into your observations—all good. First, I think integration is very important. We have the chemical technology to trigger very deep states of consciousness, but these states may have very little lasting impact on our deeply ingrained psychological and cultural habits if we don't take time to sit with them and integrate them as deeply as we can into our embodied existence.

Over the course of my work, even though I was paying a lot of attention and doing as good a job as I could to integrate each individual session, I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey. I didn't fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey and realized how hard the stopping hit me, exposing the imbalance—the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences, which were the deepest: being drawn into intimacy, into communion with—I want to say the divine, but I'm cautious because we have to unpack theological baggage.

> sking, what is your everyday consciousness like now after all of these experiences and explorations?
Chris Bache:
I wish I could tell you I’m a fully enlightened being cruising the cosmic planes all the time, but that’s not the case. Integrating these experiences is a lifelong undertaking. In the 20 years after I stopped this work, I’ve come to appreciate how large the integration process is—even to the point that I don’t think we really know how entering these deep levels of reality is influencing us as human beings. We’re just scratching the surface. If we’re working therapeutically and bringing out issues from the personal unconscious, we have a model for integration. If we go deeper and have spiritual experiences of the intelligence running through life, we have spiritual models. But when we go really deep—beyond space and time, dissolving into the luminous body of creation—how are those experiences integrated in us?

> t because of how intense and confusing it can be, integration can be really hard in day-to-day life.
Chris Bache:
It can. Once we get into this work deeply, we realize we're playing on a different field than we thought. It's a much bigger game. It's not about our personal life and transformation—we're involved in historic processes of enormous import. If you're going to engage the deep psyche, you're going into the deep end of the pool. The deep water is moving very fast right now; there's tremendous bubbling taking place. Everyone has a certain tolerance for handling the complexity and intensity at that level.

When we come back, we need to record as carefully as we can the nature of our visionary experience—and then take care of ourselves as we integrate it. It took me a year to recover from the session about the birth of the future human—the collapse into the death and rebirth of humanity—and to stabilize it. Even then, you have to practice the arts of grounding if you're going to go deep. Be well grounded at all levels: physically, emotionally, psychologically, and socially with your peer groups. It’s a demanding process.

> he role of fear and integration versus disintegration, and your ability to contain this information?
Chris Bache
To go through a death–rebirth cycle is always an ordeal. It always involves surrender to the unknown and yielding to the fear that’s holding your system locked in place. At advanced stages I truly did fear for my sanity, or at least I knew I was going someplace completely beyond anything I could hold on to. I couldn’t hold on to sanity as I had known it. It was like going over a waterfall. But once you go over and experience that death, you wake up in a new reality as a new kind of being—not just a new-and-improved you, but a different kind of being—where, for hours at a time, you can experience the universe as it experiences itself, completely beyond any human frame of reference.

> t’s been 24 years since you stopped. Do you feel you have fully integrated all of those experiences?
Chris Bache:
No, I haven’t. When I finished my sessions and was beginning the digesting process, in meditation the universe said to me, “Twenty years in, twenty years out.” I thought, “Oh, it’ll take me 20 years to assimilate 20 years of my journey.” As I was getting to the end, writing Diamonds from Heaven, I thought that was probably optimistic. I think it will take me many lifetimes to fully integrate all the gifts I’ve been given.

Sandy Sedgbeer:
What do you think, in light of what you’ve told us—what you’ve learned and seen—we most urgently need to address now as a species?

Chris Bache:
There are many layers to that question. First, we start by taking full responsibility for our shadow—engaging it and clearing obstacles and blocks that impede our compassion and healthy, whole psycho-spiritual functioning. We need to reconnect with, and rediscover, our relationship with the universe and our fundamental core identity with the universe.

> er.

Emmy Vadnais: You also took meticulous notes from your sessions, much of which is in your book.
Chris Bache: Yes. The first step of integration is an accurate phenomenological description of exactly what happens. Integration is the foundation of future sessions. If you don’t integrate thoroughly and conscientiously, you’re less likely to have as deep an experience next time. There’s a circle: you open, then you integrate what you experience, which lays the foundation for a deeper opening in your next session.

Emmy Vadnais: It seems like they built upon each other.

> en to you—when that love is so pure and magnificent? I’m nowhere near done integrating those pieces.
In the end, you can’t integrate the infinite into the finite. Your only option is to integrate the finite into the infinite. Even though my journey wasn’t about spiritual awakening per se, when you try to integrate cosmological exploration, you’re brought back to Spirituality 101: What can you hold right here, right now? What are you able to actualize right here, right now? That’s spiritual practice. You get brought right back to your cushion.

Tom Habib: The journey continues.

Chris Bache: The journey continues.

Tom Habib: This is a good place to end the formal session. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Chris, where can people find more information and your books?

> get enough light from the other side. It just is. We accept that more easily than we do with people.
Chris Bache: Exciting times we live in. I know we’re coming towards the end, so I want to mention something. The last chapter of my book is called “Coming Off the Mountain,” and I discuss what happened when I stopped my sessions—the years after I stopped. I mention this because it’s getting easier with the substances available to us to break through consciousness, to break into intimacy with the universe, to break into transcendence, to access information. My experience was that when I stopped my sessions, I thought that since I’d been given so many gifts and had so many mystical experiences and experiences of intimacy with the being of existence—dissolving into the primordial light—I thought it would be easy to stop and be nourished by those experiences. What I found was a deep existential longing to return to those dimensions. I knew I had to stop for reasons I explain in the book. I came to a point where I knew I needed to stop and slow things down, and I knew when I stopped that I would never go back into such intimacy with the divine during my lifetime. It would only happen with death—that I would return to such depth of place. I found myself slowly entering a condition where I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children, teaching my classes, doing the things I do, but in my heart of hearts I was just waiting for this life to be over so I could return to the full intimacy of the divine. In time I realized this is not right. This is not the way this work is supposed to end. I had been so careful to integrate every session and not get ahead of myself that it wasn’t clear where I had gone wrong. My life was screaming “failure to integrate,” but it wasn’t clear how I’d failed, because I had paid so much attention to integration. I learned that integrating a session is different than integrating an entire journey. My journey had taken me so deeply into transcendence that I lost my footing in the world of immanence. It’s all the divine—the physical world is the divine—but I had gone so deep into the transcendent divine that I lost my footing inside the immanent divine. It took years—about ten years—to get grounded back in space-time reality so that I could live the remainder of my years within the joy of space-time reality. I mention this because as more people have experiences of transcendence, we naturally want to go there, or let there come in here more completely. It’s really important to address integration while we are going into these states—integrate, integrate, integrate. Integrating a journey is different than integrating individual sessions. It’s a delicate process. I mention my own mistakes to encourage other people not to make those mistakes.

> it during the course of these experiences as part of integration, or was it reflection looking back?
Chris Bache:
Reflection looking back. All my sessions were recorded within 24 hours. I had about 400 pages of notes, which I studied, blocked, took apart, reassembled, diagrammed in different ways. It took years to piece together the storyline—and decide what to leave out and what to include. I left out a lot of the personal healings and small personal things because those weren’t the important parts for this book. Everyone has a personal story; as a philosopher, the story becomes interesting when the process takes you beyond the personal psyche into the deep waters of the psyche.

> o understand their implications and possibilities and their implications for how we should live now.
Chris Bache:
Yes. There’s a book just published called Psychedelics and Psychotherapy that focuses on integration. I have an article in it. We’re getting past the stage where the excitement over breaking through to these dimensions of consciousness dominates. We’re beginning to realize the real issue is: What do we do with these experiences? How can we hold them? How do we integrate them individually and in small communities? How do we integrate them intellectually so we shift the paradigm we live within?

Psychedelic experiences support the paradigm of a living universe—not dead matter, but a universe that is alive, with orders and orders and orders of intelligence behind and within physical existence. There are many levels to it. I would offer my own experiences as some of what not to do. I’m deadly serious when I say I pushed myself harder than was wise at the end. The hardest chapter to write was the last one, “Coming Off the Mountain,” where I reflect on the years after I stopped my sessions. It took me a year just to write it.

> d in those first 20 years.

Emmy Vadnais:
So you feel like you’re still integrating the experiences?
Chris Bache:
Very much so. It raises substantial intellectual questions: how do you possibly integrate experiences that so radically transcend the conditions of time and space and our consciousness inside time and space? If you have temporary experiences that go radically beyond spatial consciousness and linear time, what does it even mean to integrate them? What does integration look like when you’re dealing with such radical experiences? With lower-dose work or gentler psychedelics, where experiences come closer to your world inside time and space, integration is less demanding. But if you really open the very deep waters of the psyche, integration becomes a more substantive issue.

Emmy Vadnais:
We’re getting lots of questions. This one from Robert Bushman might be a good place to start: What is consciousness? Is there an ultimate reality, or is it infinitely fractal? How can an individual’s conscious awareness expand without psychedelics? How can one remember past lives? Maybe starting with: what is consciousness?

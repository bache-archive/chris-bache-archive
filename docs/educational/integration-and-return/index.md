*How Bache turns temporary breakthroughs into lasting change—and why integrating a whole **journey** is different from integrating a **session**.*

## Curated weave (book-first)

> *If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature.* […] *We must accept these limitations and work with them.* — **LSDMU ch.1 §3 ¶4**

Bache makes integration the bridge between *true but temporary* openings and durable maturation. The first discipline is precision and speed: capture the experience before it fades.

> *If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade.* […] *Preserving the memory… completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.* — **LSDMU ch.1 §7 ¶2**

But integration is more than private journaling; it ripens through relationship and time.

> *It takes time to integrate such experiences and make them truly one’s own. Time and sharing.* […] *“The process of integration cannot get under way properly until the experience can be shared.”* — **LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶4**

Going deep complicates the “return.” Isolation and cultural incomprehension can thin one’s public life.

> *Integration is not just a psychological process; it is also a social process.* […] *you become less authentic in their presence, less your full self.* — **LSDMU ch.12 §2 ¶5**

So what *is* integration? Not clinging to peak states, but letting them transform one’s presence.

> *…surely this is the work of integration—**to own, internalize, and manifest** your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.* — **LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶5**

Even in-session, the pace matters: use the hours conscientiously; learning arrives by becoming.

> *We show up… but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course… Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming.* — **LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶3**

*(See also: “An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine.” — **ch.1 §9 ¶4**)*

## Primary citations (book — verbatim excerpts)

**LSDMU ch.1 §3 ¶4**
> If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?

**LSDMU ch.1 §7 ¶2**
> LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.

**LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶4**
> It takes time to integrate such experiences and make them truly one’s own. Time and sharing. In his beautiful book on near-death experiences, Consciousness Beyond Life, Pim van Lommel describes the challenges that people face as they attempt to integrate their experience of transcendence into their daily lives. There he writes, “The process of integration cannot get under way properly until the experience can be shared.” This is true for deep psychedelic experience as well. In my case at least, there was a level of integration that took place before sharing my story with others and a deeper level that has opened as I have been writing this book.

**LSDMU ch.12 §2 ¶5**
> Integration is not just a psychological process; it is also a social process. When you do deep psychedelic work in a culture that is hostile to psychedelics or even just naive about them, you inevitably separate yourself from your friends and neighbors. Because it is not possible to share this important part of your life with them, your relationships grow thinner. You can enter into their world, but they cannot enter into yours. Even if they are open to the psychedelic conversation, unless they have been psychedelically initiated themselves, the discussion soon falters. It’s no one’s fault, but as a result of this invisible boundary, you become less authentic in their presence, less your full self. Again Carl Jung spoke for me when he wrote, “Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.” Of the many things I had anticipated in undertaking this journey, the personal cost of this loneliness was the most unexpected.

**LSDMU ch.12 §3 ¶5**
> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSDMU ch.9 §0 ¶3**
> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSDMU ch.1 §9 ¶4** *(optional)*
> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. […] *An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine.* […]

## Notes & synthesis
The book frames integration as disciplined remembering (immediate, accurate notes), slow digestion (years), and social sharing that thickens one’s public life. Talks expand this into practice: grounding, pacing, and humility about “true but temporary knowledge.” The key nuance is Bache’s distinction between integrating **sessions** and integrating an **entire journey**, with “coming off the mountain” as a separate integration ordeal.

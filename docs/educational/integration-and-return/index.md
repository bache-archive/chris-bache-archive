> o understand their implications and possibilities and their implications for how we should live now.
> Chris Bache:
> Yes. There’s a book just published called Psychedelics and Psychotherapy that focuses on integration. I have an article in it. We’re getting past the stage where the excitement over breaking through to these dimensions of consciousness dominates. We’re beginning to realize the real issue is: What do we do with these experiences? How can we hold them? How do we integrate them individually and in small communities? How do we integrate them intellectually so we shift the paradigm we live within?
> 
> Psychedelic experiences support the paradigm of a living universe—not dead matter, but a universe that is alive, with orders and orders and orders of intelligence behind and within physical existence. There are many levels to it. I would offer my own experiences as some of what not to do. I’m deadly serious when I say I pushed myself harder than was wise at the end. The hardest chapter to write was the last one, “Coming Off the Mountain,” where I reflect on the years after I stopped my sessions. It took me a year just to write it.

> The circumstances were unusually stable, concentrated, and focused: the same sitter for years, same set and setting, intention, location (Northeast Ohio), substance, dose level, and the same recording process—always recording each session as completely as possible within 24 hours. When you stabilize your work—eliminate variables, use the same methodology consistently—it stabilizes the conversation between you and the creative intelligence of the universe. It stabilizes the communion so that one session leads to the next in a coherent, intelligent manner. You may not understand the continuity as it unfolds, but over time you see patterns and feel you’re engaging a single creative intelligence. I say that carefully—there are many layers and forms of intelligence—but across sessions the continuity is unmistakable.

> Just to add a little more about how I understand what happened in that 20-year journey—mind you, it would take all day to do it justice—the very short version is: in each one of those 73 journeys, the first two hours were, as you described in the book, sometimes exquisitely painful as you went through the difficult process of ego dissolution and beyond—letting go of any kind of identity, even as a human. And then what happened, as I recall, is that you broke out into what you have called the vast intelligences of the universe. Believe me, folks, this is no exaggeration—the kind of material that Chris brought back is absolutely stunning and absolutely relevant to what’s going on on the planet.

> eally look forward to sharing the experiences I report in my book, LSD and the Mind of the Universe.
> David has framed our conversation as the question of whether we can all access the cosmic mind using psychedelics. I believe that we all can, but whether we all should is another matter entirely. In contrast to the early idea that psychedelics represent a shortcut to mystical experience, my concern is that the psychedelic journey into the cosmic mind is extremely demanding and must be approached with great care and caution.
> 
> In LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I describe experiences that opened in 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over 20 years when I was a young man between 30 and 50 years old, from 1979 to 1999. I then spent another 20 years thinking about these experiences, digesting them, mapping them, and pondering their implications. I hope the visions I brought back will be useful not only to other psychonauts but also to those who would never take a psychedelic themselves. What’s important is the vision of the cosmos they contain, and a vision of where humanity is in its long evolutionary journey and the turning point we’re coming to.

> y fear—fear of dying, fear of loss. If you lose that fear of dying, you live from a different place.
> LSD and the Mind of the Universe is a psychedelic memoir—a whole life’s work. I like the title Diamonds from Heaven better because it’s a story of a journey of deepening intimacy. After sessions, even a grocery store can feel like Disneyland—strange and surreal. That’s our work: go into deeper intimacy with whatever drives the universe, then come back and live our lives as best we can. Reincarnation does this—pulling us out into spiritual reality, plunging us back in, over and over. A psychedelic session reenacts that on a smaller orbit: it shatters the earthly life, opens us to what it’s like to die into the great surrounding world, then we come back into time and space. Do that enough times—incarnate enough times—and you cease to relate to the world as before.

> osophy of religion, not just for psychology, and I knew I wanted to get involved in doing this work.
> So even though LSD had been made illegal in 1970, I chose to conscientiously break the law and begin a series of rigorously structured sessions following Stan’s protocol. After three medium-dose sessions, I chose to work at high doses. This is a protocol I don’t recommend today. I would be much gentler on myself if I were doing it over again, but at the time this is what I was doing to accelerate my own spiritual development. Quickly it evolved into engaging the deep structures of human evolution and trying to support humanity’s spiritual development, and then exploring this marvelous universe that we are part of.

> You write toward the beginning of the book, “In the end, what’s important is not the method of exploration used, but what this method shows us about the extraordinary universe we live in.” That’s what I want to focus on—really the discoveries that you made. Let’s start with the title: LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I’m not sure everyone can track with you there—the universe has a mind? Tell us what you discovered.

> ’99. The last chapter is called Coming Off the Mountain—some highlights of what it was like to stop.
> I was on this journey for 20 years, then processed the experiences for another 20 before releasing LSD and the Mind of the Universe. I thought coming off the mountain would be straightforward. I was wrong—it was very demanding. In some ways it was as difficult as going up. Spirit said to me, there is the dying of seeing and the dying of keeping. The dying of seeing happens as you enter deeper states; the dying of keeping is integration. I was integrating all along, but integrating an entire journey is different than integrating individual sessions. It took a long time.

> Another thing that made it hard to come back was our society’s rules that we can’t talk about these things. I’m a teacher; I love to teach, but I couldn’t teach from this knowledge. I couldn’t share it. Writing LSD and the Mind of the Universe has been a very satisfying part of integrating my work—publicly owning my experiences and beginning to teach on the basis of them. And not just my experiences—if they weren’t supported by others in the psychedelic community, they’d amount to nothing. But I’m part of a movement, and there’s tremendous coherence in it. We’re entering into the systematic integration of psychedelics into our culture. That’s the exciting part—the teaching moment.

> hose things in mind, how do you integrate something as profound and massive as what you experienced?
> Chris Bache: Some of the integration challenges I faced are exactly why I’d recommend against doing what I did. With these substances, we can dissolve so deeply into vast territories that it truly becomes mind-boggling—how does one integrate that? As long as you’re still within time and space, uncovering your personal or even past life trauma, we have therapeutic models for integration. If you go deeper, experiencing the intelligence that runs through all things or the certainty of continuity after death, there are spiritual models for integrating that, too. Even in near-death research, where people have deep, singular experiences of transcendence, we have some sense of what integration can look like.

> long process. I think we overemphasize the dying of seeing and underemphasize the dying of keeping.
> I don’t do high-dose LSD work anymore. I’ve done low-dose sessions and some work with ayahuasca, psilocybin, and other things. After I finished my major sessions, in meditation the universe said to me, “Twenty years in, twenty years out,” which I took to mean it would take about 20 years to integrate 20 years of sessions. At the time I thought, “About right.” Now I think I was naive. I underestimated how many years—how many incarnations—it would take to internalize them.
> 
> I’ll confess: I’m an absolute failure at integration. I’ve integrated the language and the memories, but embodying those realities is another matter. How does a finite being embody infinity? How does a time-bound being embody deep time or no time? How do you embody the love—being as loving to others as the universe has been to you—when that love is so pure and magnificent? I’m nowhere near done integrating those pieces.

> ive us an outline—what was happening in there, after 70-something sessions of 500 micrograms of LSD?
> Chris Bache:
> That is the question, and it's hard to summarize—it's taken me about 300 pages just to tell the story. There were so many layers. Basically, my experience has been that the universe—or the mind of the universe, or the mind of the divine—is an infinite ocean of potential. When we drop our individual mind into that ocean, it catalyzes experiences out of that infinite potential. As we are changed, influenced, healed, and purified by that exchange, the seed crystal of our mind changes. When we later drop that same, now-transformed mind into the ocean, it catalyzes a deeper set of experiences.

> Yeah. Then I spent another 20 years digesting those experiences—writing about them, integrating them, trying to integrate them. I've written two books based on those experiences. One is Dark Night, Early Dawn, which came out in 2000, and probably the more important one for a wide audience is LSD in the Mind of the Universe, which came out in 2019. So I did this work for 20 years, and then LSD in the Mind of the Universe came out 20 years after I stopped.

> After you'd integrated a lot of what happened, and after you were also, it seems from the book, just beginning to be able to start talking about it, because you had issues where you couldn't speak. You physically couldn't speak because you couldn't speak of what you understood and what you knew. Can you tell us a little about that? That seemed to me quite an integral part of what was happening.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶5 (12 · 3)**

> As I have been working on LSD and the Mind of the Universe, my absorption of my psychedelic experiences has deepened in unexpected ways. They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe**

> LSD and the Mind of the Universe is the memoir of a psychedelic explorer. It is the story of one person’s journey into the mind of the cosmos. I’ve tried to tell this story as concisely as I can, focusing on the journey itself and keeping theoretical discussion to a minimum. I will rely on other authors to give the reader the history and science of psychedelics, their psychopharmacology, and their clinical applications. I share my psychedelic experiences here not because I think they are special or unique, for they are not, but because, all things considered, they are the most valuable gift I have to offer the psychedelic conversation.

> *LSD and the Mind of the Universe is primarily a* cosmological narrative, not a therapeutic narrative. In a therapeutic narrative, the personal details are important; in a cosmological narrative, they are less so. Of course, this entire journey was deeply personal and I own it as such, but my personal story is not the important story here, nor is it essential to the story I want to convey. It is when one moves beyond the shoals of the personal psyche and enters the ocean of the deep psyche that the larger and more philosophically interesting story begins to emerge.

LSD and the Mind of the Universe is its outer title, describing what the book is about—exploring the mind of the universe through carefully conducted LSD sessions. Diamonds from Heaven is its inner title, describing its innermost essence, for at the center of the mind of the universe, one enters the infinite clear light of Diamond Luminosity.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §3 ¶4 (1 · 3)**

> If the ultimate goal of spiritual practice is the permanent transformation of our consciousness, then the soft underbelly of psychedelics is their temporary nature. LSD plunges us into intense spiritual exercises, holds us there for a while, and then brings us back. Clearly, we cannot stay where we have gone; it is a mistaken strategy to try to do so. We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §3 ¶4 (12 · 3)**

> It takes time to integrate such experiences and make them truly one’s own. Time and sharing. In his beautiful book on near-death experiences, Consciousness Beyond Life, Pim van Lommel describes the challenges that people face as they attempt to integrate their experience of transcendence into their daily lives. There he writes, “The process of integration cannot get under way properly until the experience can be shared.” This is true for deep psychedelic experience as well. In my case at least, there was a level of integration that took place before sharing my story with others and a deeper level that has opened as I have been writing this book.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §0 ¶4 (12 · 0)**

> I think we are still in the early stages of understanding how entering these extreme states of consciousness is affecting us. We are only beginning to learn how to absorb the possibilities they unleash. As long as our sessions stay close to the shoreline of the known world, uncovering the pains of our past, we have therapeutic models for how to work with them. Travel a bit further out to experience the intelligence running through all existence or the continuity of life after death, and still we have spiritual models for absorbing these blessings. But when our journeys take us great distances from the known world—when we enter the truly deep waters of the cosmos—how are these adventures being integrated by us then? What does *integration* even mean in this context?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §7 ¶2 (1 · 7)**

> LSD generates a powerful but temporary increase in the mind’s sensitivity. Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.8 §1 ¶46 (8 · 1)**

> I believe that what I experienced in session 38 was the true birth of my integrated Soul, however incompletely actualized this consciousness may be in my present life. The paradox is that something can be fully actualized in the psychedelic state and at the same time be incompletely realized inside the demanding conditions of space-time. Indeed, *navigating these different levels of actualization is a tricky part of working with these states*. (If I could, I would underline this sentence several times.) It’s all too easy to get carried away and think that more has been permanently accomplished in these hours than actually has been. But if we stay grounded in the reality of our incompleteness, a deeper dialectic begins to unfold.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.9 §0 ¶3 (9 · 0)**

> When the shell of the private mind dissolves in psychedelic practice, experience opens to a landscape so vast it’s hard to find the right words to describe it—the Mind of the Universe, the Cosmic Mind, the Great Expanse. One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.1 §9 ¶4 (1 · 9)**

> In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §0 ¶5 (2 · 0)**

> LSD unleashes such dramatically different states of awareness from anything we experience in our everyday life that we have to learn how to work with it. Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.

> The in-taking of sacred awareness and the activation and stabilization of our innate capacities is the long and patient work of reincarnation, and I believe it is the long work of psychedelic practice as well, at least after the early excitement of discovery passes. In our later sessions, we are no longer running to explore a universe “out there,” but rather are “calling down heaven,” pulling higher states of awareness into our physical being, alchemically mixing heaven and earth in the vessel of our human body. When *nirvana* (enlightenment) and *samsara* (cyclic existence) are truly one, when full transparency lives in the sea of perpetual change, then heaven is realized on earth and there is no felt need to go elsewhere.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶22 (1)**

> Assume for the moment that through the fiery exercises of psychedelic exploration we have managed to stabilize experience at the high subtle level of consciousness. In order to reach this level, what “we” are has changed. We are no longer our private selves but have temporarily become some aspect of subtle level reality. Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a *cosmic communion* to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric. It is God communing with God, nourishing Its self-manifesting, self-emergent being in ways we may glimpse but perhaps never fully comprehend.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §2 ¶5 (12 · 2)**

> Integration is not just a psychological process; it is also a social process. When you do deep psychedelic work in a culture that is hostile to psychedelics or even just naive about them, you inevitably separate yourself from your friends and neighbors. Because it is not possible to share this important part of your life with them, your relationships grow thinner. You can enter into their world, but they cannot enter into yours. Even if they are open to the psychedelic conversation, unless they have been psychedelically initiated themselves, the discussion soon falters. It’s no one’s fault, but as a result of this invisible boundary, you become less authentic in their presence, less your full self. Again Carl Jung spoke for me when he wrote, “Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.” Of the many things I had anticipated in undertaking this journey, the personal cost of this loneliness was the most unexpected.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.2 §2 ¶13 (2 · 2)**

> As the negative perinatal experiences continued to build over the next several sessions, so did the positive experiences that emerged during the ecstatic portion of the sessions. In one session, I experienced life as a living fabric of interwoven intelligences—atomic, molecular, cellular, human, societal, and planetary. This early taste of the weave of Oneness was just a metaphysical appetizer for the deeper experiences of Oneness that would follow later, so I will not spend time on it. I would, however, like to share one experience from this period because it speaks to the rationale for this book as a whole. This session helped me let go of my conventional academic training and embrace psychedelics as anew method of philosophical inquiry.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §2 ¶4 (12 · 2)**

> Because of my culture’s restrictive laws around psychedelics, I could not bring my visionary experiences back into my world. I integrated my sessions as best I could, but my integration, like the work itself, was private and surreptitious. Though I kept myself whole in my personal life, I was not allowed to be whole in my public life, and if you are not whole in your public life, can you ever be truly whole? How can transcendence and immanence find their proper balance in such compromised circumstances?

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.12 §1 ¶7 (12 · 1)**

> I was in a strange condition. Everything I had learned on my psychedelic journey was now part of my being, giving me an inner calm and confidence in the innate wisdom of life. Because of my sessions, I could see the beauty and grandeur of our living universe. I saw human beings everywhere challenging themselves to become more, their former lives bubbling up inside the talents and foibles they took for granted. I knew their suffering would be healed in the bliss that follows each death and in their Soul’s unquenchable passion for continued self-transformation. I felt the pulse of our collective heart as we struggled with our past to give birth to our future self. I could see the genius of the Creative Intelligence manifesting everywhere around me, and yet I no longer wanted to be here.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe Appendix I §1 ¶21 (1)**

> Let me draw upon Sri Aurobindo’s involutionary/evolutionary cosmology here because it resonates strongly with the cosmology that emerges in psychedelic work, as Stan Grof has demonstrated in his beautiful book *The Cosmic Game*. According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.

**LSD and the Mind of the Universe ch.10 §5 ¶1 (10 · 5)**

> In the beginning of this book, I said that there were two basic trajectories in my psychedelic work. The first was spiritual awakening, and the second was cosmic exploration. While I never let go of personal liberation as my baseline objective, the work of collective liberation and the adventure of exploring the cosmos had come to dominate my sessions. Now in these late sessions, the arc of the work seemed to be curving back around to the original goal of spiritual awakening.

Chris Bache: Some of the integration challenges I faced are exactly why I’d recommend against doing what I did. With these substances, we can dissolve so deeply into vast territories that it truly becomes mind-boggling—how does one integrate that? As long as you’re still within time and space, uncovering your personal or even past life trauma, we have therapeutic models for integration. If you go deeper, experiencing the intelligence that runs through all things or the certainty of continuity after death, there are spiritual models for integrating that, too. Even in near-death research, where people have deep, singular experiences of transcendence, we have some sense of what integration can look like.

> you unpick a bit of the structure you see as useful for helping us move toward being future humans?
Chris Bache
There are several things rolled into your observations—all good. First, I think integration is very important. We have the chemical technology to trigger very deep states of consciousness, but these states may have very little lasting impact on our deeply ingrained psychological and cultural habits if we don't take time to sit with them and integrate them as deeply as we can into our embodied existence.

Over the course of my work, even though I was paying a lot of attention and doing as good a job as I could to integrate each individual session, I still underestimated the long-term challenges of integrating an entire spiritual journey. I didn't fully comprehend this until I had stopped my journey and realized how hard the stopping hit me, exposing the imbalance—the failure to integrate the most extreme, radical experiences, which were the deepest: being drawn into intimacy, into communion with—I want to say the divine, but I'm cautious because we have to unpack theological baggage.

> sking, what is your everyday consciousness like now after all of these experiences and explorations?
Chris Bache:
I wish I could tell you I’m a fully enlightened being cruising the cosmic planes all the time, but that’s not the case. Integrating these experiences is a lifelong undertaking. In the 20 years after I stopped this work, I’ve come to appreciate how large the integration process is—even to the point that I don’t think we really know how entering these deep levels of reality is influencing us as human beings. We’re just scratching the surface. If we’re working therapeutically and bringing out issues from the personal unconscious, we have a model for integration. If we go deeper and have spiritual experiences of the intelligence running through life, we have spiritual models. But when we go really deep—beyond space and time, dissolving into the luminous body of creation—how are those experiences integrated in us?

> t because of how intense and confusing it can be, integration can be really hard in day-to-day life.
Chris Bache:
It can. Once we get into this work deeply, we realize we're playing on a different field than we thought. It's a much bigger game. It's not about our personal life and transformation—we're involved in historic processes of enormous import. If you're going to engage the deep psyche, you're going into the deep end of the pool. The deep water is moving very fast right now; there's tremendous bubbling taking place. Everyone has a certain tolerance for handling the complexity and intensity at that level.

When we come back, we need to record as carefully as we can the nature of our visionary experience—and then take care of ourselves as we integrate it. It took me a year to recover from the session about the birth of the future human—the collapse into the death and rebirth of humanity—and to stabilize it. Even then, you have to practice the arts of grounding if you're going to go deep. Be well grounded at all levels: physically, emotionally, psychologically, and socially with your peer groups. It’s a demanding process.

> he role of fear and integration versus disintegration, and your ability to contain this information?
Chris Bache
To go through a death–rebirth cycle is always an ordeal. It always involves surrender to the unknown and yielding to the fear that’s holding your system locked in place. At advanced stages I truly did fear for my sanity, or at least I knew I was going someplace completely beyond anything I could hold on to. I couldn’t hold on to sanity as I had known it. It was like going over a waterfall. But once you go over and experience that death, you wake up in a new reality as a new kind of being—not just a new-and-improved you, but a different kind of being—where, for hours at a time, you can experience the universe as it experiences itself, completely beyond any human frame of reference.

> t’s been 24 years since you stopped. Do you feel you have fully integrated all of those experiences?
Chris Bache:
No, I haven’t. When I finished my sessions and was beginning the digesting process, in meditation the universe said to me, “Twenty years in, twenty years out.” I thought, “Oh, it’ll take me 20 years to assimilate 20 years of my journey.” As I was getting to the end, writing Diamonds from Heaven, I thought that was probably optimistic. I think it will take me many lifetimes to fully integrate all the gifts I’ve been given.

Sandy Sedgbeer:
What do you think, in light of what you’ve told us—what you’ve learned and seen—we most urgently need to address now as a species?

Chris Bache:
There are many layers to that question. First, we start by taking full responsibility for our shadow—engaging it and clearing obstacles and blocks that impede our compassion and healthy, whole psycho-spiritual functioning. We need to reconnect with, and rediscover, our relationship with the universe and our fundamental core identity with the universe.

> er.

Emmy Vadnais: You also took meticulous notes from your sessions, much of which is in your book.
Chris Bache: Yes. The first step of integration is an accurate phenomenological description of exactly what happens. Integration is the foundation of future sessions. If you don’t integrate thoroughly and conscientiously, you’re less likely to have as deep an experience next time. There’s a circle: you open, then you integrate what you experience, which lays the foundation for a deeper opening in your next session.

Emmy Vadnais: It seems like they built upon each other.

> en to you—when that love is so pure and magnificent? I’m nowhere near done integrating those pieces.
In the end, you can’t integrate the infinite into the finite. Your only option is to integrate the finite into the infinite. Even though my journey wasn’t about spiritual awakening per se, when you try to integrate cosmological exploration, you’re brought back to Spirituality 101: What can you hold right here, right now? What are you able to actualize right here, right now? That’s spiritual practice. You get brought right back to your cushion.

Tom Habib: The journey continues.

Chris Bache: The journey continues.

Tom Habib: This is a good place to end the formal session. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Chris, where can people find more information and your books?

Chris Bache: My website—chrisbache.com. It’s a bit unfinished—my web designer jumped ship about three-fourths of the way through—but it’s there, and you can reach me through it.

> get enough light from the other side. It just is. We accept that more easily than we do with people.
Chris Bache: Exciting times we live in. I know we’re coming towards the end, so I want to mention something. The last chapter of my book is called “Coming Off the Mountain,” and I discuss what happened when I stopped my sessions—the years after I stopped. I mention this because it’s getting easier with the substances available to us to break through consciousness, to break into intimacy with the universe, to break into transcendence, to access information. My experience was that when I stopped my sessions, I thought that since I’d been given so many gifts and had so many mystical experiences and experiences of intimacy with the being of existence—dissolving into the primordial light—I thought it would be easy to stop and be nourished by those experiences. What I found was a deep existential longing to return to those dimensions. I knew I had to stop for reasons I explain in the book. I came to a point where I knew I needed to stop and slow things down, and I knew when I stopped that I would never go back into such intimacy with the divine during my lifetime. It would only happen with death—that I would return to such depth of place. I found myself slowly entering a condition where I was just waiting to die. I was taking care of my children, teaching my classes, doing the things I do, but in my heart of hearts I was just waiting for this life to be over so I could return to the full intimacy of the divine. In time I realized this is not right. This is not the way this work is supposed to end. I had been so careful to integrate every session and not get ahead of myself that it wasn’t clear where I had gone wrong. My life was screaming “failure to integrate,” but it wasn’t clear how I’d failed, because I had paid so much attention to integration. I learned that integrating a session is different than integrating an entire journey. My journey had taken me so deeply into transcendence that I lost my footing in the world of immanence. It’s all the divine—the physical world is the divine—but I had gone so deep into the transcendent divine that I lost my footing inside the immanent divine. It took years—about ten years—to get grounded back in space-time reality so that I could live the remainder of my years within the joy of space-time reality. I mention this because as more people have experiences of transcendence, we naturally want to go there, or let there come in here more completely. It’s really important to address integration while we are going into these states—integrate, integrate, integrate. Integrating a journey is different than integrating individual sessions. It’s a delicate process. I mention my own mistakes to encourage other people not to make those mistakes.

> it during the course of these experiences as part of integration, or was it reflection looking back?
Chris Bache:
Reflection looking back. All my sessions were recorded within 24 hours. I had about 400 pages of notes, which I studied, blocked, took apart, reassembled, diagrammed in different ways. It took years to piece together the storyline—and decide what to leave out and what to include. I left out a lot of the personal healings and small personal things because those weren’t the important parts for this book. Everyone has a personal story; as a philosopher, the story becomes interesting when the process takes you beyond the personal psyche into the deep waters of the psyche.

> o understand their implications and possibilities and their implications for how we should live now.
Chris Bache:
Yes. There’s a book just published called Psychedelics and Psychotherapy that focuses on integration. I have an article in it. We’re getting past the stage where the excitement over breaking through to these dimensions of consciousness dominates. We’re beginning to realize the real issue is: What do we do with these experiences? How can we hold them? How do we integrate them individually and in small communities? How do we integrate them intellectually so we shift the paradigm we live within?

Psychedelic experiences support the paradigm of a living universe—not dead matter, but a universe that is alive, with orders and orders and orders of intelligence behind and within physical existence. There are many levels to it. I would offer my own experiences as some of what not to do. I’m deadly serious when I say I pushed myself harder than was wise at the end. The hardest chapter to write was the last one, “Coming Off the Mountain,” where I reflect on the years after I stopped my sessions. It took me a year just to write it.

> d in those first 20 years.

Emmy Vadnais:
So you feel like you’re still integrating the experiences?
Chris Bache:
Very much so. It raises substantial intellectual questions: how do you possibly integrate experiences that so radically transcend the conditions of time and space and our consciousness inside time and space? If you have temporary experiences that go radically beyond spatial consciousness and linear time, what does it even mean to integrate them? What does integration look like when you’re dealing with such radical experiences? With lower-dose work or gentler psychedelics, where experiences come closer to your world inside time and space, integration is less demanding. But if you really open the very deep waters of the psyche, integration becomes a more substantive issue.

Emmy Vadnais:
We’re getting lots of questions. This one from Robert Bushman might be a good place to start: What is consciousness? Is there an ultimate reality, or is it infinitely fractal? How can an individual’s conscious awareness expand without psychedelics? How can one remember past lives? Maybe starting with: what is consciousness?

> sing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.
Emmy Vadnais: What are some of the teachings you received?

Chris Bache: That the universe is a manifestation of a single consciousness—a massive consciousness beyond anything we’ve grasped in Western religious and philosophical traditions. Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning. Those are a few touch points.

> egration—what does it mean to remember that, and what does it mean to catch ourselves in forgetting?
Chris Bache
We go up on the mountain, we see some things, maybe receive blessings, and then we come down and go to work on Monday morning. Over and over again. It’s a matter of constantly engaging, being aware of how you’re engaging, checking yourself, recommitting to doing a better job—again and again.

For me, much of it showed up in my work as a teacher. I loved being with the students and always wanted to do it better, but I constantly caught myself making assumptions, drawing false inferences, not doing a good enough job, being a little tired and letting them down on a particular day—then coming back and trying to do better the next day, the next week, the next semester. Over and over, trying to live up to what we know to be true.

Jeannet Weurman:
I hear that—the biggest potential for purification is right here with us.

Chris Bache:
Essentially, if the human species can be fixed—if it can be awakened—everyone will be safe on the planet. If we don’t save ourselves and wake ourselves up, then all life forms will continue to be in danger.

Jeannet Weurman:
Thank you. The second question was: after this incredible gift of realization—big question—what have you been doing with your life for the last 20 years?

Chris Bache:
Good question. I spent 20 years really thinking about these sessions and trying to understand them. It takes a long time to integrate experiences this deep. Much to my surprise, coming down the mountain of these visions was almost as difficult as going up the mountain. The last chapter of the book is called “Coming Off the Mountain,” where I describe some of the challenges I faced coming away from the visionary state and re-entering a fully grounded condition.

> can be both Chris Bache and the cosmos. Who says you can’t be both? Aristotle? We live in his world.
One other important thing, Chris. We touched on this briefly last time. There seems to be a suggestion in your language—a quality of return. “I want to return to the Beloved. I want to return to the Light.” I’m wondering how we can play with that alongside decimating the notion of path itself. Is “return” a provisional description, and a more absolute approach would be recognition and self-liberation? That is, you don’t need to return to anything—the issue is removing the cataracts of confusion, opening the aperture of heart and mind, and the Light, the Mother, is right here now. Does that speak to you when you reference longing to return to the Mother, the Beloved, the Clear Light? That denotes a subtle dualism—“I have to return”—versus “No, I just recognize.”

> d beautiful that you did it with that aspiration and prayer. It feels like your prayer was answered.
John Dupuy:
Chris, what do you do these days to keep yourself—having gone on such a remarkable journey and come back? You mentioned teaching. Do you have a way of staying awake to what you were gifted and shown, or do you find that the transmission and teaching keep you crisp in this limited reality while staying in touch with and transmitting what you learned on the other side?

Chris Bache:
There’s a question I ask in the book: What is the value of true but temporary knowledge? I don’t doubt that any of the experiences I had were true, and I also know they were temporary. I cannot live in those places. The idea of bringing them back and integrating them as a stable state may be true for certain levels of experience, but for some of the deeper experiences it’s not possible—at least not at my present level of psycho-spiritual development. I know there are great beings who are masters of these domains, and they are my guiding light. But Chris’s abilities cannot stabilize these states of consciousness.

> f the evolution and ecology of consciousness? Where might we focus our intentions on a path forward?
Chris Bache
About halfway through my journey, in the 38th session, in a year of enormous blessings, I was taken on an experience preceded by very intense purification—very intense death-rebirth processes. At one phase in this journey, I experienced all my former lives coming into me. I had done past-life therapy before. I was familiar with about a dozen of my past lives, and I’d already written a book on reincarnation, so I was comfortable with the idea. But this was different: my former lives began coming into me like winding a string on a kite spool. They hit a critical mass and fused. There was an explosion of energy, and all these separate lives fused into one life. A burst of diamond light came out of my chest, and I was catapulted into a state of consciousness beyond anything I had realized up to that time. I was an individual, but an individual beyond any frame of reference I had known. Then I was given a lot of teachings, over and over again, so I would understand what was happening. It changed my understanding of how reincarnation works and where it’s taking us.

> he is challenging. You’ve also said it took you 10 years to digest what you experienced in the ’90s.
Chris Bache:
When I stopped my work in ’99, I thought that, having been given so many gifts, I could simply withdraw and nourish myself by continuing to digest and assimilate them. That was true—but only half the truth. The other half was confronting the tremendous sense of loss I had from not being able to enter this deeply into communion with the universe. There was a real loss of communion because I couldn’t sustain it in my daily life. Some beings can—the great masters of meditation have always been my heroes—and they hold these experiences in an abiding way. That wasn’t the case for me. It took me about 10 years to get over my sense of loss and to recommit to being who I was, where I was, for the remainder of my life, and do as much as I could with that time.

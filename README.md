# Chris Bache Archive (2014 – 2025)

## Purpose
This archive safeguards—and makes searchable—the **public talks, interviews, and reflections of philosopher-author Christopher M. Bache** recorded between 2014 and 2025.

It preserves **four complementary layers of record**:
- **Edited transcripts** — readable textual versions generated by GPT-5 from Otter.ai diarized exports.  
  *(Note: as of v2.5, no full human editorial review has yet occurred.)*
- **Raw captions** — direct machine output (YouTube auto-captions).
- **Diarized transcripts** — Otter.ai exports with automated speaker attribution.
- **Original media** — MP4 video and MP3 audio, downloadable via Zenodo / Internet Archive bundles.

The goal is to maintain an **open, structured, verifiable, and now publicly discoverable archive** so that Chris’s voice and insights remain accessible to future generations of seekers, scholars, and technologies.

## Current Status (v2.5 — October 2025)

- **Transcripts:** 63 machine-normalized transcripts in `sources/transcripts/` (all produced by GPT-5 from Otter.ai diarized sources).  
- **Captions:** 61 matching raw caption files in `sources/captions/` (some items are audio-only).  
- **Diarist:** Otter.ai diarized `.txt` files in `sources/diarist/`.  
- **Index:** `index.json` maps all entries with metadata; `index.md` provides a human-readable table.  
- **Media:** MP4 video + MP3 audio preserved for nearly all items (mirrored via Zenodo and Internet Archive).  
- **Integrity:** Every file carries a cryptographic SHA-256 fingerprint and per-item manifest (`manifests/<id>.json`), verifiable via `checksums/RELEASE-v2.4.sha256`.  
- **Documentation:** Added `POLICIES.md`, `EDITORIAL_NOTES.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `ETHOS.md` for procedural, interpretive, temporal, and ethical transparency.  
- **Archival mirrors:** Full transcript + metadata snapshots deposited to Zenodo (DOI) and Internet Archive.  
- **Discoverability:** Each transcript now has an HTML version for web indexing; a valid sitemap and robots.txt make the archive fully crawlable by Google and Bing.  
- **Books:** Added first book-level work (*LSD and the Mind of the Universe*, 2019) with canonical section registry and dual edition alignments (hardcover + audiobook).

## Web Publication & Indexing (new in v2.5)

- Each transcript in `sources/transcripts/` now has a matching `.html` file rendered via `tools/generate_html.py`.  
- These HTML pages are publicly available on **GitHub Pages**:  
  https://bache-archive.github.io/chris-bache-archive/  
- A valid `sitemap.xml` lists all `.html` and `.txt` pages for search-engine indexing.  
- `robots.txt` explicitly allows full crawl and declares the sitemap:  

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://bache-archive.github.io/chris-bache-archive/sitemap.xml

- Sitemap has been submitted to **Google Search Console** and **Bing Webmaster Tools**.  
- The goal is to ensure that both **humans and future LLMs** can easily discover and access every transcript and diarist file.

## Naming Convention
- **Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug` (shared across transcript, caption, audio, video, and diarist).  
**Example:**

2023-03-16-collective-shadow-work-and-turning-toward-our-pain.md  
2023-03-16-collective-shadow-work-and-turning-toward-our-pain.txt  
2023-03-16-collective-shadow-work-and-turning-toward-our-pain.mp3  
2023-03-16-collective-shadow-work-and-turning-toward-our-pain.mp4  

- **Rules:**  
- Use the original recording date.  
- Lowercase + hyphens, no spaces or punctuation.  
- Remove honorific punctuation (e.g., `prof.` → `prof`).

## Book-Level Segmentation (new in v2.6-dev)

Beginning with *LSD and the Mind of the Universe* (2019), the archive now supports  
**book segmentation and edition alignment**, enabling stable, cross-format citations.

- Canonical registry: `sources/transcripts/lsdmu/lsdmu.section-registry.json`  
- Hardcover pagination alignment: `alignments/lsdmu/innertraditions-2019-hc.json`  
- Audiobook time alignment: `alignments/lsdmu/audiobook-2019.json`  
- Conversion tool: `tools/convert_durations_to_alignment.py`  

This framework extends the archive beyond recorded talks,  
preserving major written works with verifiable structural metadata.

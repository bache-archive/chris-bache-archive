# Chris Bache Archive (2014 – 2025)

## Purpose
This archive safeguards—and makes searchable—the **public talks, interviews, and reflections of philosopher-author Christopher M. Bache** recorded between 2014 and 2025.

It now preserves three parallel layers of the record:
- **Edited transcripts** — textual record, cleaned for clarity and citation.
- **Raw captions** — direct machine output (YouTube auto-captions).
- **Diarized transcripts** — Otter.ai exports with automated speaker attribution.
- **Original media** — MP4 video and MP3 audio, downloadable via Zenodo/Internet Archive bundles.

The goal is to maintain an **open, structured archive** so that Chris’s voice and insights remain accessible for future generations of seekers, scholars, and technologies.

## Current Status (v2.4 — October 2025)
- **Transcripts:** 63 edited transcripts in `sources/transcripts/` (all rebuilt from diarist sources for improved speaker attribution).
- **Captions:** 61 matching raw caption files in `sources/captions/` (some items are audio-only, no captions available).
- **Diarist:** Otter.ai diarized `.txt` files in `sources/diarist/`.
- **Index:** `index.json` maps all entries with metadata; `index.md` provides a human-readable table.
- **Media:** MP4 video + MP3 audio preserved for nearly all items (mirrored via Zenodo and Internet Archive).
- **Archival mirrors:** Full transcript + metadata snapshots deposited to Zenodo (DOI) and Internet Archive. Media-only bundle also mirrored separately for permanence.

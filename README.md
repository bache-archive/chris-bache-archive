# 🧠 Chris Bache Archive (2009–2025)

**Purpose**

This repository safeguards — and makes searchable — the complete public talks, interviews, and written works of philosopher–author **Christopher M. Bache**, recorded and published between **2009 and 2025**.  
Our aim is verifiable preservation: every utterance and every text traceable, every citation reproducible.

Beyond storage, the archive preserves **continuity** — the evolution of Bache’s thought across decades — enabling scholars, seekers, and intelligent systems to study not only *what* he said and wrote, but *how his understanding matured*.  
See [WHY_CONTINUITY_MATTERS.md](WHY_CONTINUITY_MATTERS.md) for the philosophical rationale behind this approach.

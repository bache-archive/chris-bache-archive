# Chris Bache Transcript Archive (2014 – 2025)

## Purpose
This archive safeguards—and makes searchable—the **public talks, interviews, and reflections of philosopher-author Christopher M. Bache** recorded between 2014 and 2025.

It is first and foremost a **textual transcript archive**: each item includes an **edited transcript** prepared for clarity and citation, and where available, the corresponding **raw caption export**.

Future phases may expand to include video, audio, slides, or images, but the current focus is on **clean, consistent text**.

---

## Current Status (September 2025)
- **Edited transcripts**: 59 complete, with YAML metadata headers and line-by-line cleanup in progress.
- **Captions**: 59 matching raw caption files (from YouTube/auto-generated sources), stored separately for reference.
- **Indexing**: master list reconciled against both sets for one-to-one alignment.

## Folder Map

chris-bache-archive/
├── sources/              ← edited transcripts (final .md files)
│   └── captions/         ← raw caption files (aligned 1:1)
└── index.md              ← simple index of edited transcripts

- Each transcript is stored as a **Markdown file** with a **date-first filename**:

YYYY-MM-DD-short-descriptive-slug.md

- Every file begins with a YAML metadata header including:
- `archival_title`
- `channel`
- `recorded` / `published`
- `speakers`
- `license` (CC BY-SA 4.0)

---

## Naming Convention
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md`
- Example:

2023-03-16-collective-shadow-work-and-turning-toward-our-pain.md

- Rules:
- Use the original publication date.
- Lowercase with hyphens, no spaces or punctuation.
- The same root is reused for both edited transcript and caption.

---

## Contribution Workflow
- Improvements: open a PR with line-by-line edits to an existing transcript.
- New transcripts:
1. Add the cleaned Markdown transcript in `sources/` with metadata header.
2. If a caption exists, place it in `sources/captions/` with the same filename.
3. Update `index.md`.

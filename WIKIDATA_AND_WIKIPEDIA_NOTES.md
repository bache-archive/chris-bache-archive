- Added links to OpenAlex, ResearchGate, official website.
- Linked verified book items:
  - LSD and the Mind of the Universe (Q136684740)

- Added institutional affiliations and start/end dates for teaching positions.
- Confirmed publisher metadata and URLs for all works.
- All updates executed manually via `wikibase-cli` using the Bache-archive BotPassword (documented privately).

### Wikipedia (Draft)
- Draft created November 2025 under the Articles for Creation (AfC) process.
- Neutral biography drafted with citations from reliable, independent sources.
- Includes factual reference to the Chris Bache Archive as a digital preservation project (GitHub Pages).

1. Transparent provenance for metadata curation.
2. Reproducibility for future contributors or auditors.
3. Clear separation between public encyclopedic content and project self-documentation.

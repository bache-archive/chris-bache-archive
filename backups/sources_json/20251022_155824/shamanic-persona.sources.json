Our previous psychedelic knowledge and the identity based on it must surrender control before a deeper mode of knowing can emerge and stabilize. What’s dying in these sessions, then, is sometimes the shamanic persona; its death may feel personal, but it’s not the ego—rather, a deeper individual identity birthed through previous sessions. One shamanic persona may die and be reborn multiple times; after the transition, the new persona retains the memories of the former and adds to them from this new, deeper level. When an even deeper level opens, the current persona must die and yield again.",

If nature is trying to bring about this pivot toward a higher form of consciousness, then despite the upheaval at political, social, and cultural levels, the deeper movement is toward truer, clearer, better, more good. Individuals who have made the transition in their own being that humanity is trying to make collectively can become seed catalysts. Their very presence helps catalyze what’s trying to emerge beneath our feet at the collective level.\n\nIndividuals have tremendous power to influence—not just physically, but subtly. Traditions have long recognized the radiance around deep practitioners. Chinese traditions valued contemplatives outside town; Christian monasteries and convents understood their practice benefits surrounding communities. I think that subtle influence will be increasing as we move forward. Beautiful.",

It’s a different kind of death.\nIn the appendix of LSD and the Mind of the Universe, I suggest four levels to begin addressing that question. First, our personal ego can die. Second, some aspect of the collective ego—the collective psyche—can die. Third, what I call the shamanic persona can die. That’s a complicated concept. When you’ve been on the journey a long time, each time you move into psychedelic space, you resume your shamanic persona—the living integration of all your psychedelic experiences to that point. Let’s say, after 20 sessions working at the level of the collective psyche, what I called the ocean of suffering, you stabilize a psychedelic identity that integrates your transpersonal experiences beyond physical consciousness. If you are going into a still deeper level of consciousness than you’ve ever lived before, that shamanic persona has to die—surrender—to allow a new category of experience, and a deeper shamanic persona, to emerge. So in advanced sessions, it’s not the egoic self dying; it’s the psychedelic self.",

What can I do?” And we're shamanic practitioners—it's not our field—so we're trying to pass this on to people who can actually help, but they're few and far between, because there are a lot more people who think they can help than the ones who can actually help.\n\nSo take great care.

When people hear LSD, they think the ’60s, hallucinations—this is very far from that. This is within a therapeutic tradition, within Stan Grof’s tradition: the systematic use of these very hyper-intense states of awareness. When you engage these states, there are cycles of tremendous purification—tremendous death and rebirth, death and rebirth. If you go through it often enough, deeply enough, there is a progressive initiation into deeper and deeper levels of reality, and eventually you come out with a certain understanding, at least, of the larger structure of the nature of reality.

LSD has a range too, and of course doses affect that range.\nI tend to experience psilocybin as very body-grounded, tuned to my emotional body. It opens a range, but it stays, in a sense, within parameters. It stretches but does not shatter as aggressively as LSD the parameters of individual identity—though it can dissolve and soften them, and open things up. In my work with high doses of LSD, all of these things happen, but because of the particular intensity of the substance and its lack of anthropological history—therefore lacking the fields associated with psilocybin and mescaline/peyote—it tends to shatter our time-space identity and throw us into a level of experience beyond that reality, into a spiritual reality. If we go back to that place again and again, our experience there begins to congeal, and we develop an alternative identity persona. I call it the shamanic persona—an identity comprised of all my experiences at that level of transpersonal reality. It’s superordinate to my individual egoic identity, and it can be stable if my experiences have been well managed.",

This is already opening doors, and I'd like to go down a few of them. We're talking about integrating with other systems, and in the book you were becoming quite deeply involved in some Buddhist practices—were they Buddhist, I think? Within the shamanic world, we see a lot of people who want to go off and do ayahuasca or mushrooms, and it seems to me they're short-cutting—not universally; I’ve spoken to people who are absolutely prepared to go and spend six months in the forest alone with the plants and integrate it—but there are an equal number who think they can go from point A to point Z without actually doing the steps in between.",

Everything below the line in the image I used is time-space reality; the drop at the end represents our individual time-space identity, our egoic identity. The first transition is the death-rebirth that takes place when we move into spiritual reality—ego death. It gets a lot of attention in the literature, but less attention is given to deeper deaths at deeper levels. Stan Grof uses the vocabulary of psychic-level transpersonal experience, subtle-level transpersonal experience, causal-level experience, because the universe reveals itself in layers. Every time one goes into a deeper level of consciousness, everything known up to that time—including what you know to be true from previous psychedelic experiences—must be surrendered if a truly new and novel dimension is going to open.",

They’re convenient but necessarily rough; how can six categories capture the full spectrum of divine experience? They’re useful to mark transitions on this journey. These cycles are like tori: you break through, expand into a new level, gather in, blow through to another level, stabilize competencies in that state, gather again, and then, if you follow the process, another death-rebirth into a deeper level.\n\nOne way I image this is with a nuclear explosion—not to dwell on the horror it represents, but to make a point: deep death-rebirth shatters everything you’ve known and drops you deeper into the universe, revealing levels previously outside awareness. In an explosion, deeper atmospheric layers become visible; likewise, deep psychedelic work brings levels into awareness that were always there. Dissolve the dualism in that image: you’re not separate from the strata you enter; you dissolve into that field. We’re not talking about bombs; we’re talking about the cosmos exploring itself.",

It was about trying to heal some aspect of the collective psyche.\nThere is an organizational structure—a species consciousness—and the unresolved wounds of history remain not only at an individual soul level but at the species level. All the wars, the terrible things we’ve done to each other—the trauma, to the extent it’s not healed, resides as unfinished business in the collective psyche. Every spiritual practitioner who goes deeply enough, whatever their method, is often given an invitation, if they choose, to lift some of that suffering—not just from their personal life but from the collective psyche. For reasons I think are soul-choice, that became a large part of my work. There’s nothing special here. Any mother who sees a child suffering will try to alleviate it. Any father worth his salt will try to help a suffering child. If we’re given the opportunity, we try to help others in pain. That’s the normal working of life.",

The line represents the border of time-space; the drop below the line is egoic reality—our individual time-space consciousness. The first death and rebirth, the one most discussed in the literature, is ego death when we transition from ordinary consciousness into early transpersonal consciousness. But if you keep pressing the limits, there are other deaths at other levels of consciousness. I follow Stan Grof in using the vocabulary of psychic, subtle, and causal reality to describe some of these deeper levels. I don’t have a vested interest in how many levels there are or how many times the circle turns. What’s important is the principle: if one pushes deeper and does this work systematically, a series of deaths and rebirths opens.",

It's closer to a collective inheritance or a cosmological story.\nWhen you do this work, you go through many cycles of death and rebirth—not just ego death. The diagram I use starts below the “cross line,” representing ego, and marks the first death-rebirth cycle with astrological glyphs, out of respect for Rick Tarnas and Stan Grof’s insight into the correlations between astrological transits and non-ordinary experiences—insights my own sessions sometimes affirm, but not always entirely. That first death-rebirth happens at what Stan calls the perinatal level of consciousness. From there, one moves into deeper and deeper states, with death and rebirth recurring at each level and drawing you further and further into reality. Stan Grof, following Ken Wilber, describes these levels as psychic, subtle, and causal. I don't have a strong opinion on what exact scale to use; there are thousands of dimensions of consciousness. The important thing is just to recognize the vast range of transpersonal states, and that entry into each involves a cost—a surrender. At the outset, what’s asked is the surrender of your ego, but deeper surrenders occur as you continue the journey.",

I was shown how the individual is hardwired and soft-wired into this matrix, how the species mind informs our individual consciousness, and how our individual work reaches out to inform and structure future species consciousness. I saw that each of us carries a holographic, fractal piece of the diseases of our time—mental and physical—and as we heal ourselves, we contribute to healing the collective psyche. In that sense, you could say the collective psyche is more real than the individual psyche, though I’d put it differently: the individual is real; the collective is real.

Now that we know how vast the physical universe is, the question becomes: how large and how deep is the mind of the universe? Just out of graduate school in 1978, finishing in philosophy of religion, I encountered the work of Stanislav Grof—one of the foremost thinkers in transpersonal psychology and the psychedelic community. I read his book Realms of the Human Unconscious, and my life pivoted. I saw his research was relevant not only to clinical psychology but to philosophy: he was offering a method to safely and systematically explore the deepest levels of consciousness, where the answers to the philosophical questions I carried from religious studies might lie.",

Would you like to say more?\nChris Bache:\nMy first concern was that it sounded like ego gone amok—ego inflation. I had to sit with that a long time, because my experiences told me that’s not what was happening. As you said, it’s a very different worldview. In the classic individual patient model, the individual is having experiences. The individual has transpersonal experiences, and the individual is always at the center. In this model, my individual existence was completely secondary. It becomes not a matter of my being central. I got the system started, but I dissolved completely into preexisting fields of consciousness. Those fields are the dynamic force having the experiences.\n\nThat manifested not only in the ocean of suffering, but later in archetypal reality and causal oneness. In many experiences, Chris Bache was a bit player. In the book I have an appendix: what dies and is reborn? After so many deaths and rebirths, it becomes a cognitive question. What is actually dying? It feels personal. Is it just ego dying over and over?",

It is useful to understand your personal ways of contracting and sustaining your smallness, but for me—trained as a philosopher—I wanted to understand the larger spectrum of reality.

We’re hardwired into the collective psyche—physically, biologically, mentally, spiritually. Everything we do registers in the collective, and the collective shapes everything we do. An extreme example: when I die, I take my psychedelic experiences with me, but the species mind keeps them too, because I was human when I had them. They become part of the human family’s experience. This is true for all of us. Harm registers; healing registers. Insights, care, compassion infuse the network of life that is the human family, and beyond.\n\nThe spiritual traditions say there’s no such thing as private spiritual practice. In Buddhism, you begin practice by cultivating bodhicitta—the aspiration to benefit all sentient beings—and end by distributing the merit to all levels of being. The trap is thinking it’s about personal enlightenment. The traditions say the opposite: it’s not about you; it’s all of us. Open your heart and mind, let the pain in, bring the healing out.

And I want to say this—there’s a lot of discussion about psychedelics and enlightenment: do psychedelics lead to enlightenment? Are they counterproductive or productive? These adventures were not aimed at enlightenment; I mean, they started that way. I started because I was interested in enlightenment—I thought I could do these sessions, ego would die, and I’d get to enlightenment faster. But that changed quickly. After my first ego death, instead of personal transformation, the story opened up into a story of deep collective transformation. I began to enter what I call the ocean of suffering—what the Buddhists call the hell realms—deep suffering still living within the collective psyche. This went on for two years, over many sessions and years, involving so many people that it eventually shattered my perception of what was going on. It wasn't aimed at my personal transformation but at the transformation of some aspect of humanity’s collective unconscious. After that culminated, I entered into archetypal reality. In that phase, I had to cease to be a human being. I discovered that there is a human identity deeper than your individual identity. Just as I had to die as Chris Bache to become something larger, I had to die as a human per se and go completely outside of any frame of reference of humanity to move into what I determined were different dimensions of archetypal reality. Every step deeper is a step into much more intense energy. In the beginning, it can be shattering and hard to maintain coherent awareness. But I found that if I went back again, systematically—about five times a year—over time you go through a purification and clarification process. You learn how to stay conscious at levels of reality where, at first, you could not remain conscious—you have to practice.",

I had always been a meditator, but this represented a more formal commitment to a specific lineage of dharma transmission. I was comfortable with most of Buddhist thought—not the patriarchy—and many of its teachings had been confirmed in my sessions. Vajrayana Buddhism is sometimes described as a synthesis of the sage tradition of Indian Buddhism and the shamanic Bon tradition indigenous to Tibet. Shamanism, therefore, is built into its very fabric. Perhaps this is why combining Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice always felt natural to me.",

Where meditation is a path of self-clarification that allows the layers of the mind to open gradually, the sacred medicine path cultivates intense but temporary surges of awareness. By amplifying our present awareness, the medicine path opens us more quickly to a deeper communion with the universe. This is a good thing, a healing thing, but it can also bea tricky thing because it’s easy to overestimate the staying power of these dramatic exercises. To use Abraham Maslow’s vocabulary, we can overestimate the value of our *peak experiences* and underestimate the challenge of achieving more stable *plateau experiences*. Or as Ken Wilber reminds us, *states* of consciousness are not *stages* of spiritual development.",

From Sheldrake’s perspective, the collective psyche, or species-mind, influences its individual members, as Jung suggests. But Sheldrake goes further than Jung in proposing that the collective psyche also receives and integrates the learning of its members. Sheldrake envisions a complex feedback loop operating between the species-mind and individuals that allows the species-mind to learn as its members learn. Collective learning progresses more slowly than individual learning, but when the species-mind eventually grasps a truth, the resulting shift ripples through the entire species resulting in faster learning curves.",

A different set of insights emerges when we follow one person through this territory. Without this collective database, the individual’s journey could be written off as being merely a private fantasy. Against the background of this collective database, however, tracking one person through this terrain brings out certain features of the psychedelic process more sharply: the multiple stages of initiation, the deepening spiral of death and rebirth, and the participatory dynamics of psychedelic disclosure.

This assumption was reinforced by the fact that in-between my sessions, my ego, though softened, was still intact, with many of its failings and idiosyncrasies in place. If ego-death had already completed itself inside my sessions, I reasoned, shouldn't I be more liberated outside my sessions? The fact that I was not completely liberated in my day-to-day life suggested that there were still fragments of ego alive within me, potentially driving these ordeals. I assumed that when my ego-death process was complete, these collective ordeals would stop because there would no longer be a core of unfinished ego-death for them to attach to.",

This consciousness not only remembers our experiences, it also preserves the knowledge and capacities we acquired in them. I call this psychedelically generated self-awareness the shamanic persona. The shamanic persona reflects the natural aggregating function of life. Life remembers and holds on to its experience at all levels, as Rupert Sheldrake and Ervin Laszlo have argued. The shamanic *persona* can be thought of as a state-specific alter ego. In calling this entity the shamanic persona, I am not suggesting that it has a masking function but am simply drawing attention to the fact that it is a living identity that changes as our psychedelic experience deepens. It could also be called the *shamanic self*.",

After ego-death, a shamanic persona emerges as the living integration of our early transpersonal experiences.

This second persona will retain the memories and knowledge of the first persona and add to it the new knowledge and capacities gained at this second level. If we continue to push the boundaries of experience, sooner or later this second shamanic persona will also have to surrender in order for a still deeper dimension of consciousness to open and become fully operational.",

We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.",

There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know.

LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering.

Ego-death destroys the existential isolation and constant self-referencing that organizes our ordinary experience of the world. When the partitions of personal consciousness are surrendered, our experience spontaneously opens to the larger rhythms of life that we are part of. One portion of these rhythms is the collective psyche of our species. At the subtle level of consciousness, we can dissolve into the human species-mind so deeply that the beginnings and endings of our personal life become insignificant. When the “small-self” opens to the “species-self” this completely, it is only natural that insights into humanity’s larger developmental trajectory sometimes emerge in our awareness.

        "text": "This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.",

This has been one of Stan Grof’s invaluable contributions. By phenomenologically mapping the psychedelic experiences of hundreds if not thousands of people, Stan has established the ontological validity of the transpersonal territory. A different set of insights emerges when we follow one person through this territory. Without this collective database, the individual’s journey could be written off as being merely a private fantasy. Against the background of this collective database, however, tracking one person through this terrain brings out certain features of the psychedelic process more sharply: the multiple stages of initiation, the deepening spiral of death and rebirth, and the participatory dynamics of psychedelic disclosure. It is this work for which context is vital. Each of these perspectives complements and strengthens the other.",

I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind.

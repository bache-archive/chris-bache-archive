I tracked my sessions. I used astrology to plan my sessions after I learned from Rick Tarnas about correlations between outer planets and inner experience in psychedelic states. I planned my sessions by transits, and I tracked the patterns of my breakthroughs against the planets. I found a very complicated correlation. While there were correlations between my individual transits and global transits with the unfolding of my psychedelic experience, there were also differences I wasn't expecting—a failure to find correspondence. For example, my breakthroughs were not always paired with Uranus. My really intense, up-against-the-wall, death-in-your-face experiences were not marked by Saturn transits or Saturn global transits, or even Pluto transits.",

As my work deepened over the years, I couldn't correlate breakthroughs and impasses with astrological variables as much as I had anticipated. That led me to formulate what I call the roll off hypothesis: in the early stages of our work, or at lower doses—when our time-space identity is being unfolded and impacted—I think there are stronger correlations between our natal transits, the transits to our natal chart, or even global transits. But as one’s work deepens, when you begin to go into and beyond archetypal reality—beyond time and space and deep into the universe—I think there's a roll off effect of the planetary correlates to experience.",

I suppose we’re all participants in creating it.\nChris Bache: The movements you mentioned—neo-paganism and eco-spirituality—I see both as attempting to put nature back into spiritual discourse, which was one of the things lost in the classic patriarchal religions. They’re trying to bring us back to the innate wisdom of nature, a wisdom that runs throughout our consciousness and our bodies, connecting our body consciousness to the body consciousness of Earth. Eco-spirituality is a way of experiencing spirituality that connects us to the planet and to the stars.\n\nWe can see this in the resurgence of interest in astrology—not a naive, mechanistic astrology, but the vision that the universe has a pulse to it. The galaxies have a pulse, our solar system has a pulse, and if you know how to read that pulse, you can feel how your body and destiny unfold in rhythm with it. That’s a form of eco-spirituality—solar spirituality, galactic spirituality.",

Rick Tarnas is a good friend, as is Stan, and I'm aware of Stan's writing and his analysis of cases and the astrological correlations of people going through breakthroughs. I'm aware of the proposal that the outer planets correlating with the perinatal matrices seem to be somewhat predictive of patterns of oppression, contraction, breakthrough, and liberation in people's experiences.\n\nI've looked at these correlations in my own work. First of all, I completely accept the proposal they've made. I understand it. It makes sense. The intelligence of the universe that I experience makes it intuitive that the rhythm of the universe would be part of the rhythm of this intelligence, and that as we open beyond the personal psyche there would be a kind of solar system pulse in the nature of our experiences.",

If you read only one or two from this list, I hope you’ll read Newton. A hypnotherapist doing past-life therapy, he accidentally discovered that clients in deep hypnosis could remember not only previous lives but what happened after they died. He followed them—good therapist that he is—through death into the afterlife memories and asked careful questions, keeping detailed notes. Regardless of background—fundamentalist Baptist, Karl Marxist atheist, hard-core scientific reductionist—people described the same fundamental reality in the after-death state: a world with order, structure, and logic; a social structure where older learners teach younger learners; and a place where reincarnation is a conscious, careful choice. It’s like choosing college courses: once you sign up, you’re committed for the semester. Incarnating is an important choice made under the guidance of spiritual helpers and in cooperation with the people you’ll incarnate with. Before we were born—when we knew more than we know now—we chose the life we’re living. That fact alone bears deep meditation.",

We are entering a period of infusion of grace and energy that’s driving the past up so we can deal with it: the hatreds of history, the divisions of race, gender, nationality, haves and have-nots—all the patterns of splitting the world into categories—are being driven out of us. They have to come out to make us available to the influx of divine energy entering us, whether you think of it as coming from above or from within. There’s something deeply true in these ancient prophecies: we are, in a sense, in the age of the Kali Yuga and coming into a profound new age.

If we can incarnate, then they can incarnate. Distance is immaterial. There are people who have conscious recall of having been a life form on another planet. I can’t remember her name, but there’s a woman who does past-life therapy with a major focus on helping people integrate incarnations from other planetary lifetimes. Do a little digging around. I personally don’t have conscious recall of such, though I was at a spiritual workshop where a teacher had recall that he, I, and one other person there had shared another planetary system in another incarnation.

All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.",

Our nature is the nature of the divine, which is the nature of reality itself. So it’s not completely accurate to frame this as a duality between me and It. At a deeper level, my being is a fractal manifestation of Its reality. Our relationship is deeply essential and mutually participating from the start. But functionally, in terms of Chris Bache, I am so small and It is so vast that there’s a relative duality involved. And between my small bit and the totality are layers upon layers.

My psychedelic dance did not map easily into the astrological dance. I began to think there might be a roll-off effect between one's solar dance and one's session experiences. This continues to be an area of active dialogue and consideration for me. There is an appendix in the book called “Pushing the Limits of Astrological Correspondence.” In that appendix I give the dates of all of my sessions. If one wanted to, one can look at my natal chart, look at the sessions, and examine the correlations or lack of correlations. I know there aren't enough sessions given to provide a definitive answer, but I wanted to support discussion about the relationship between astrology, astrological and global transits, and one's own psychedelic work. To me, that's an open question. I know there are correlations, particularly in the early stages of one's work. Whether those correlations continue to be as strong in the later stages, I'm not as convinced.",

Because our solar system is constantly moving, the variable of planetary setting changes in subtle ways from day to day and month to month. In a collaboration of many years, Stan Grof and Richard Tarnas have proposed the bold hypothesis that people’s experiences in deep nonordinary states move in synchrony with the rhythms of our solar system. Using case histories, Grof has argued that natal and transit astrology can illumine and even predict the tenor of one’s psychedelic session on any given day.

In the classic up-and-out model of rebirth, for example, it is often said that it is a “law” of reincarnation that we are not allowed to remember our former lives when we are born. This amnesia is essential because if we were able to remember our former lives, it would overwhelm our earthly identity. Our present life would become unmanageable if we remembered everything we had ever been and done in our previous lifetimes. Numerous Hollywood movies have played with this theme.

While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less.

A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.",

        "text": "In this context, I will mention that this may be one advantage of the long LSD time window compared with short-acting psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT. LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.",

From the Eleusinian mystery rites of ancient Greece to the peyote ceremonies of Native Americans and the ayahuasca churches of present-day Brazil, human beings have been ingesting consciousness-amplifying substances for thousands of years and have all come to the same conclusion: these substances are sacraments that help us reconnect with the universe. Seen in this context, therapeutically structured LSD sessions are not an end run around spiritual practice, as some early scholars thought, but a particularly intense form of spiritual practice, with its own distinctive characteristics and challenges.",

Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state.

We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.",

According to Sri Aurobindo, in the cascading involution of the Divine, many levels of existence are manifested. While these levels may be porous from “above,” they are less porous from “below.” Like looking through a series of one-way mirrors, the Divine looking “down” sees everything It has become, but looking “up” from lower levels, the Divine sees less. When we who are below manage either by hard labor or by grace to access some of these higher levels, a special magic sometimes takes place.",

Once we began to gain *experiential* access to the bliss of this mother universe through meditation, yoga, and psychedelic substances, how could we not but conclude that we “belonged” there more than here, that Earth was not our “true home,” and that we had “fallen” from paradise through some kind of cosmic blunder? Our enthusiasm for these theologies of return is understandable given their historical context, but in the context of the dramatically expanded understanding of the universe emerging in science combined with our deepening psychedelic experience, we are beginning to see that these theologies reflect an incomplete model of the cosmos.",

We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?",

And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.",

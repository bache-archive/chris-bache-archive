I like the title Diamonds from Heaven better because it’s a story of a journey of deepening intimacy. After sessions, even a grocery store can feel like Disneyland—strange and surreal. That’s our work: go into deeper intimacy with whatever drives the universe, then come back and live our lives as best we can. Reincarnation does this—pulling us out into spiritual reality, plunging us back in, over and over. A psychedelic session reenacts that on a smaller orbit: it shatters the earthly life, opens us to what it’s like to die into the great surrounding world, then we come back into time and space. Do that enough times—incarnate enough times—and you cease to relate to the world as before.",

Returning to my personal story, when this long phase of collective dying and rebirth had ended, it was followed by a series of five overwhelmingly positive sessions that seemed to constitute a megarebirth. I felt overwhelmed by grace, filled with blessings, with a deep sense that I’d accomplished the primary purpose of my incarnation. At that point, after all those years, I hoped that the ordeal of dying would stop eventually; I thought the transition to transpersonal reality would become easier—and I think it would have, if I had stayed within the boundaries of transpersonal experience I had thus far initiated. But for better or worse, the method of exploration I’d chosen was so powerful it kept pushing me beyond my experiential limits. I was working with five to six hundred micrograms of LSD in totally internalized sessions.",

Second: Why does death repeat itself so many times in this long process? And third, and perhaps most difficultly: What is actually dying in the death-rebirth process?

I’m not making light of death or trivializing it, only affirming this deeper insight: everything we are survives the death of the body. At the end of every lifetime, we return to where we came from as a resting place. We are restored and refreshed, and then we return to the challenges of history. We don’t have to live through all the evolutionary future to know freedom from the fear of death. If there were one thing from my psychedelic experiences I wish I could give the world, it would be eliminating the fear of death.

Our time-space identity—our ego—dies, and one enters spiritual reality. Repeating this surrender leads to deeper encounters with the structures of existence. I follow Stan in adopting his vocabulary to describe these states as the psychic level of transpersonal experience, the subtle level, and the causal level. LSD is sometimes likened to a nuclear bomb of the psyche—developed in the same decade as the nuclear bomb. A sustained, very intense psychotherapeutic process sets in motion a catalytic energy sustained over years. Sessions get deeper and deeper in a sustained fashion. It’s not unlike a nuclear explosion revealing deeper levels of the atmosphere: they were always there, but previously invisible, and now the force brings them into awareness. This is just an analogy, but in sustained psychedelic work, you don’t simply start over at the beginning of every session; one session starts where the previous left off. You go deeper and eventually enter discrete levels of consciousness with their own rules. You acclimate and learn to become consciously aware at these depths. We’re not talking about nuclear bombs—we’re talking about entering the mind of the universe, the great expanse of consciousness. Some would call it God or the Divine; I prefer the mind of the universe, the mind of the cosmos. In my journey into this vast consciousness that holds all existence, I went through multiple layers, experiencing deaths and rebirths along the way.",

Second, entering the collective mind, the collective psyche. Third, entering archetypal mind—the domain described by Jung and Plato, though different than either portray it. Fourth, entering causal oneness. Oneness appears much earlier in the journey, but causal oneness is distinctive: there is no outer boundary. It is the totality of existence; you cannot step outside it to get a perspective on it. Fifth, the domain of Diamond Luminosity, which occupied me for the last five years of my journey.\n\nIn the book, these stages map to chapters: crossing the boundary of birth and death; exploring collective mind—the ocean of suffering, deep time in the soul, initiation into the universe; archetypal mind—the greater real of archetypal reality; causal oneness—a benediction of blessings.",

They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.",

There is a certain violence in dying. Over the course of the work, I learned that the deepest breakthroughs followed the deepest purifications, and the deepest deaths yielded the deepest ecstatic joys on the other side. As that became clear, death became my closest ally. Rather than trying to avoid harsh confrontations, I did everything I could to facilitate their emergence. I went right at it—not because I like suffering, but because I like what was on the other side.

From a reincarnation perspective, we’re always popping into time-space and popping out into a spiritual meta-universe, then back in and out again. From this perspective, what is death? All the enlightenment and awakening traditions say the same thing: birth is not the beginning of our life. Look carefully and you’ll find in your body and mind evidence of experience that far predates your physical life. Death is not the end, because we now have, especially through the work of people like Michael Newton on life-between-lives and past-life therapy, abundant evidence of a continuity of consciousness that predates and postdates our individual life.",

Not a physical death and rebirth, but a psycho-spiritual one—though it did involve much physical suffering and many deaths. I experienced it not as “Chris Bache,” not even as an expanded version of myself, but as the entire species. My consciousness dissolved into the collective psyche. I experienced a crescendo of suffering and a birth coming out of that suffering—a new form of human being.",

This is one of the great gifts that Stan Grof gave me—reading his work, I learned to trust the process. If you submit to it—let it take you where it will—no matter how terrible it becomes, no matter how inscrutable, if you surrender to it, it will always culminate. It will take you through a breaking point, and then it will catch you. You die, and then you awaken into a different condition, a different reality, as a different being in a different dimension of existence.\n\nIain McNay:\nSo what do you mean that you will die—what does that actually mean in a tangible way?\n\nChris Bache:\nIn order to experience intimately the deep nature of reality, you can't take your ego into that reality and have a transpersonal experience. The only way to enter these realities is to become a “citizen” of those realities. Our time-space identity—just by the conditioning of time and space—keeps us small. In order to enter vast expanses of reality, we have to let go of what keeps us small. So you go through a psychological death—ego death is very common.",

It’s a beautiful vision.\nChris Bache:\nEvery time we die, at the deepest level all spiritual traditions tell us no one dies—we transition into a different level of reality. I’m not making light of death or trivializing it, only affirming this deeper insight: everything we are survives the death of the body. At the end of every lifetime, we return to where we came from as a resting place. We are restored and refreshed, and then we return to the challenges of history. We don’t have to live through all the evolutionary future to know freedom from the fear of death. If there were one thing from my psychedelic experiences I wish I could give the world, it would be eliminating the fear of death. I am not only unafraid of dying—I’m looking forward to it, because death is homecoming. Always, death is homecoming.\n\nSimeon Mihaylov:\nDifferent spiritual traditions have said that in different ways. Carl Jung says at one point that life is a short period between two infinities—which, in the end, might just be one. I think that’s a beautiful way of putting it.",

        "text": "ain and suffering to reach deeper levels of consciousness. Can you share what that was like for you?\nChris Bache: In the early stage at the level of personal mind, the pain and suffering took the form Stan Grof discusses as the perinatal level—sometimes reliving birth and confronting the fundamental existential questions of life in physical reality. Is there meaning, order, design, intelligence? At the physical level, everything we love will be destroyed at death. Is there any reality beyond death? You have to face the deepest levels of metaphysical angst until your identity is crushed and shattered. That’s easier for some than others, but you must surrender your time-space identity to gain access to the next level. At that next level, I continued a deepening confrontation with pain, suffering, and violence—so deep and prolonged, encompassing so many hundreds of thousands of persons over thousands of years, that I concluded it wasn’t a cleansing of my personal psyche. Something was using my sessions to set in motion a reconciliation and healing of levels of pain that were fundamentally collective. Then further deaths and rebirths followed, where the nature of death and suffering changes the deeper you go. The basic principle is simple: if you want to experience oneness with God or the mind of the universe, our historical consciousness is too small—if you want to literally experience it, not just think it. To immerse yourself in communion with these levels, your small identity must be surrendered and you must flow into a larger identity. Eventually you enter levels where it would misrepresent things to say “Chris Bache went and had those experiences.” Rather, Chris Bache has to be destroyed, dissolved, for these levels of consciousness to manifest inside my awareness. The fact that I remember them doesn’t mean my personality was present when they were had. You lose yourself, enter communion with the universe, and when you come back you gather the experiences, and my personality synthesizes and integrates them. It’s a pulsing: surrender completely, open, breathe, receive teachings, then bring it back in and consolidate.",

That makes some people in the therapeutic community uncomfortable. But once you learn that deep purification—the deep confrontation with limits at any level—leads to ecstatic deliverance from those limits at another level, then it's the most natural thing in the world. It's quite natural for us to die. Nobody survives the game of life. We live in a culture that's uncomfortable engaging content around death because we don't understand what death is. We're chronically constricted within time-space realities. We don't understand what happens when we die or the liberation death involves. It's not just psychedelics that show us this. Near-death research shows us this; hypnotic regression past-life therapy shows us this; Michael Newton’s work shows us this. Once you understand the larger circle—that life is a circle; that there is birth, a deep internalization of circumstances and challenges and learning; and then death, which is a phase of homecoming, returning to the light—what's to be afraid of? Dying is graduation. Birth is when the hard work begins. That's what you should be afraid of.",

I think what dies and is reborn is something of truly cosmic proportions.

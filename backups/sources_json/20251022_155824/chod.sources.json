If you know Alex Grey’s depictions of powerful energies triggered in deep psychedelic work, you’ll recognize how, after a session, your system can feel achy and stretched. Vajrayana practices—Guru Yoga or deity yoga—gave that energy a place to run when I was back in ordinary consciousness and body. So for clarifying cognitive content, practicing teachings given in sessions, and managing the energetic consequences, a daily spiritual practice is really important.",

Simple, natural.\nSo I asked: what would it be like to teach consciously in a transpersonal or integral pedagogy—one that recognizes the innate interconnectivity of consciousness? Not abandoning individual strategies that work, but incorporating focused intentionality and conscious engagement that goes beyond classical teaching. For example, ChÃ¶d is a Vajrayana purification practice. I learned ChÃ¶d for my own spiritual work. Before a class began, when I received the roster, I started incorporating those students into my ChÃ¶d practice. I would literally pray for them throughout the course—for their well-being. Not presuming I know what’s right for them, just praying for their well-being.",

I’d always been a meditator, but I began a more formal relationship with Vajrayana teachers and practice. This helped where I was working—very pure, intense states of awareness, Diamond Luminosity. It was increasingly difficult for my subtle energy system to sustain encounters with the enormous flows of pure energy in this diamond consciousness. When I began doing ancient practices—ChÃ¶d and various deity practices—I found my physical, psychological, and subtle energy systems could breathe more freely. Vajrayana gave me a space midway between physical consciousness and psychedelic consciousness. By entering those states, I could channel the energy that came in my psychedelic sessions; it moved more freely. It gave me a way of dialoguing with the universe that allowed my body and mind to breathe more comfortably. It was very helpful.",

The skills cultivated in Vipassana or zazen—observation and non-attachment—are precisely the skills you use in a psychedelic session, so they reinforce each other. Meditation also gives you an environment to assess the cognitive content of your sessions and to process the energy ignited in them.\n\nIn the chapter on Diamond Luminosity, I talk about integrating Vajrayana practice with my psychedelic practice. I didn’t begin Vajrayana until about the time I was entering Diamond Luminosity. Carol brought me into the Vajrayana tradition by doing a ChÃ¶d practice for me before one of my sessions. The window that opened—this was my 45th session, so I had a lot of history—was wider, deeper, and stayed open longer than earlier sessions. I immediately learned that practice and began doing it before any session. I would never go into psychedelic space without doing ChÃ¶d, which means cutting—it's a cleansing practice.",

The Samaya Sava is the being of construct we formulate through mantras, visualizations, tankas—an approximation of pure goodness and pure insight—which then attracts the Jnana reality, the cosmic reality. We make our visualization pure to open a channel so the cosmic reality can pour its blessings into us. In a way, I use my psychedelic memories as part of constructing my Samaya Safa.

By becoming temporarily more aware, I could feel more precisely how these practices affect body and mind. They also helped me manage challenges. I didn’t end up doing this work for the purpose of spiritual awakening—though that was always in the background—but as a philosopher hungry to explore the nature of reality. Vajrayana helped me manage the excess energy flowing through my body by giving it an intermediate place to live and breathe—between my physical existence and my psychedelic existence. It taught me these practices are much more powerful than I’d appreciated working from ordinary time-space consciousness.",

Its most striking characteristic was clarity—clarity, clarity, clarity. It was the context within which all thinking and feeling took place; in itself it was hyper-clear, breathtakingly clear. I understood the teachings that even touching something like this for one second dissolves thousands of years of wandering in the shadows of samsara. I came to understand it as extra-samsaric reality, and a particularly intense version of it. At first I thought of it in terms of sambhagaya because of the extreme bliss, but as I went back to the sources and studied more carefully, I associated it with Dharmakaya—the clear light of absolute reality.",

When one sits to meditate or do spiritual practice, the first step is cultivating bodhicitta—the wish to save all sentient beings. You do the practice not for personal benefit but to nourish the uplift of the whole of creation. The last step is distributing the merit—you give away the blessings you’ve acquired.

        "text": "ime, which I recall you relating to bhakti—loving devotion, alleviating the suffering of all beings?\nChris Bache: Yin and yang is an attempt by a particular culture to articulate some of the deep structure of the universe and to point to this primal duality, which then divides into the 10,000 things—the complexity of the evolving of life. But I think we have to be careful not to hang too much on the primary polarity—good/bad, male/female, things like this. Bhakti is a different issue, and this was a surprise to me. In Hinduism there are four systems of spiritual work—four yogas: jnana yoga, the yoga of meditation; karma yoga, the yoga of action; and bhakti, the yoga of emotion. It’s loving God—it’s becoming awakened through love. I had always been attracted to the mental forms of spiritual practice. Of all the yogas in Hinduism, I was least attracted to bhakti—the cultivation of an emotional relationship with the divine—yet I found in the psychedelic work that bhakti was activated, very powerfully activated. I had not only a mental relationship with the universe and a cognitive experience of the universe, but an overwhelmingly powerful emotional connection and experience so that it became a love relationship. Everybody has to develop their own vocabulary for ultimate reality, but my vocabulary for ultimate reality—I call the Absolute “my Beloved,” “the Beloved,” because that’s the bhakti quality.",

I was taking care of my children and my students. I wasn’t suicidal; I was living a balanced life. But in my heart, I was waiting to die. Eventually I realized something’s wrong.

This is a variation of a universal pattern: if you want to open to deeper truths and a deeper participatory relationship with the universe, you have to empty yourself of everything keeping you small—old ways of thinking and feeling—and those patterns have biological correlates. You go through detoxification—physical as well as mental and emotional. In Tibetan Buddhism, before receiving higher teachings capable of generating awakening, one must first do what’s called NDR, the preparatory practices—five practices you do 100,000 times each. One is full-body prostrations while reciting mantras. You’re going to the ground, lying down, getting up, praying—retuning your mind with mantras, your heart with devotion, and working your body to purify it while purifying mind and heart. That’s how it is for all spiritual practice. If psychedelics push you quickly into a higher state, you then have to purify after you’ve been in that state.\n\nAviv Shahar:\nYou either need to pay on the front end, during, or after.\n\nChris Bache:\nPay now or pay me later, but you have to pay.",

I was more interested in the Zen tradition. I wasn’t interested in all the bells, candles, incense, and fanfare that comes with Vajrayana. But she went there, and I followed her. Through her, I met teachers gathering at the Tara Mandala Buddhist retreat center—Lama sutra malayonis established the center in Colorado—and I began to study there and go into retreats with that lineage. I met their lineage of awakened beings, and they made a deep impression on me. If my karma had introduced me to the great awakened beings of the Zen lineage, I could have gone there just as easily. It was the opportunity to meet these beings and receive teachings that made a large impression.\n\nTasshin Fogleman:\nComing back to your explorations, you use the phrase “deep time.” Can you say what you mean by that?",

Here was a method that allowed deep, firsthand access to dimensions of consciousness and, through those dimensions, to dimensions of reality I had seen described in many spiritual literatures. This was a protocol that allowed people to be initiated, if only temporarily—what I call the path of temporary immersion. We have to be careful not to confuse a path of temporary immersion with what I would call the path of abiding presence, the more contemplative, meditational path.

Welcome to the people who are live and those who are going to join us later.\nChris Bache—the story I know is that he is now a retired professor of religious studies and philosophy from Ohio State University and Youngstown, Ohio. Early in his career he was always interested in mysticism and deep spiritual exploration, and he came upon the work of the legendary psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, who pioneered a protocol for working with high doses of LSD in particular. Chris undertook what turned out to be a 20-year journey of 73 high-dose LSD sessions following the Stan Grof protocol—sessions using 500 to 600 micrograms of LSD, which, for any of you not familiar with that calculation, is a high dose. The protocol involves working at home or in a safe, quiet space with headphones and a carefully curated playlist, eyeshades to block out the light so inner visions aren’t obstructed, and a qualified sitter. In Chris’s case, the sitter was a therapist who knew what she was doing. Generally, he did this on a Saturday, and the following day—again following the Grof protocol—he spent basically the whole day with the headphones on to trigger memories of what was playing when certain experiences and visions occurred, and then meticulously transcribed all that.",

Creation is intentional. I hesitate to use “design,” but there is an intelligence manifesting in time and space. We are part of this intelligence; our nature is of the same nature as its nature—Atman is Brahman. Reincarnation is a fact of life. We won’t get far trying to understand existence unless we understand the pulse of life—that our current life is just the most recent in many cycles of life and death. There is an underlying logic to our circumstances—what Buddhists and Hindus call karma—an intentionality working itself out in our lives. Our evolution is not driven solely by blind chance and mechanical processes; there is a deeper intelligence manifesting in our circumstances and challenges, inviting us to become more by the end of life than we were at the beginning.

When I found the methodology that Stan made available, I decided to push it as long and as hard as I could. There was a great deal of suffering, episodically and periodically.

Chöd means “cutting.” It is a Vajrayana Buddhist practice for removing obstacles and cutting through ego. Its lineage traces back to Machig Labdrön, a revered female practitioner from eleventh-century Tibet. Carol had received the practice from her teacher, Lama Tsultrim Allione, who had received it from her teacher, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. I quickly accepted her invitation because it felt timely. The previous session had finished well, and today felt like it would be a good day. So on this particular morning, we started the day with Carol doing Chöd over me for forty minutes, and then we began the session.",

In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.",

Nothing holds its existence by itself but is always transparent to the underlying matrix of cause and effect. When one experiences emptiness, one experiences the complete absence of an independent self, not only in one’s own person but in all reality. In this session, I experienced emptiness and Oneness as two sides of the same coin. When we experience the universe as One, it is clear that independent, separate things do not exist. Conversely, when the separate self dissolves completely, the Oneness of life spontaneously rises in our awareness.",

And yet, personally, I never felt a contradiction between my Buddhist practice and my psychedelic practice. A difference in emphasis, method, and even goals, perhaps, but no contradiction in core values. I do not believe that the Buddhist prohibition against “taking drugs that cloud the mind” applies to psychedelic substances *when they are used therapeutically*, because in these circumstances they do not cloud the mind. Just the opposite, they hypersensitize the mind, and by skillfully focusing this hypersensitivity, we can bring the poisons and toxins of our mind to the surface and remove them. I think Chögyam Trungpa was correct when he described LSD as a kind of “super-samsara.” LSD amplifies the samsaric tendencies of our mind and invites a confrontation with these tendencies that, if handled well, supports the liberation of the mind. Though my psychedelic journey became a cosmological exploration that reached beyond liberation, it always felt congruent with liberation.",

One falls into it, explodes into it, melts into it, sometimes cataclysmically, sometimes so gently it feels like the most natural thing in the world. We are not in control of these expeditions. We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming. The lessons are repeated again and again until our grasp of the material is secure, then new layers are added until the fuller picture emerges.",

They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.",

We must accept these limitations and work with them. But how can we work with these temporary states in a way that will advance our permanent transformation?",

Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state.

LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.",

In Tibetan Buddhism, monks must do Ngöndro before they are allowed to receive the higher initiations that engender realization. Ngöndro are the foundational practices that prepare the body and mind to receive the advanced teachings. Part of Ngöndro involves doing one hundred thousand full-body prostrations while reciting prayers and mantras. These exercises strengthen and purify the body and its subtle energy system. On the other hand, if one moves into higher states of awareness quickly, as one tends to doin an LSD session, the body is spontaneously thrown into a purification process by the sheer power of the state one is entering. Pay me now or pay me later. Either way, entering deeper states of awareness requires purifying one’s psycho-physical system.",

Painful experiences can become something you seek out rather than avoid. The utterly bizarre can become the familiar so many times that you cannot anticipate what shape the next twist of learning will take. You may find yourself stuck in some endless repetitive maze where it is not clear what is happening, what you are doing to perpetuate this stalemate, or what you might do (or stop doing) to shift the situation.

By contrast, working with a psychedelic like LSD is an example of a transformational practice that triggers an accelerated purification process that gives us quicker access to these realities, but there is a price to be paid for this quicker access.

It wasn’t simply a matter of eating the same karmic meal in fewer bites, as I had naively thought. Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web. Working at these levels changed not only how deep my experiences went but also who or what was actually having these experiences, what the “working unit” of experience was in a session.

Inside our sessions, we live as a life-form that breathes this rarified air. When through further exercises a doorway opens to still deeper levels of consciousness at the causal level, my experience has been that it allows a *cosmic communion* to take place between the causal and subtle realms. Deep communes with deep. Bringing different levels of spiritual reality into conscious communion with each other, even if for only a few hours, seems to nourish and bring joy to the weave of existence as the “below” remembers the “above” and the blessings of “above” pour more freely into the “below.” What is taking place is a cosmic dance between deep levels of the divine fabric.

Over multiple sessions, there’s an accumulation of energy in your being. My system was storing energy session after session, even when months apart, building a massive momentum that would focus and lead to a breakthrough into a new level of consciousness. Those breakthroughs were paid for not simply by hours of intense work but sometimes by years of work. To get back into some of the territory I explored—the diamond luminosity—it would take years of conscientious work to rebuild that energetic momentum.",

Nothing seems to happen, then a few bubbles, then, at boiling point, it erupts into steam. Simple metaphor, but true throughout nature. Humanity is reaching that period. Scientists point to similar thresholds. The ocean, for example, has been capturing huge amounts of CO2—sinking it to the deep—but it’s slowly building up. At some point the ocean can no longer capture more; its ability weakens, and the CO2 we create suddenly explodes into the atmosphere. It looks like we’ve been in a hiatus, and we have, because there’s an illusion we’ve been okay—until everything speeds up much more quickly than most could conceive. Some scientists see it—especially those who work across multiple fields, systems theorists who understand interconnectivity. And mystics like us. Many are predicting very quick change that can be destabilizing for the planet.",

We, as individual egos, are born over and over again in roughly hundred-year cycles. Underneath those cycles there’s a learning taking place, a developmental process we usually refer to as the soul. The individual incarnates, but the soul is growing, becoming more, suffusing our lives. The same thing happens collectively: every generation, billions of people are born, but there’s a learning gathering underneath them, collecting in deep, archetypal structures.

The principle of accumulation is fundamental to understanding what’s happening in creation. The universe is accumulating—it’s learning. It’s a self-learning system. We are constantly learning; we can’t help but learn. Even if we do a mediocre job in a lifetime, we’re still learning. As we learn, we activate capacities. In one sense, I think we’re learning to be geniuses in every area of life: a genius at chess, a genius at relationships—genius in all the different areas. Each lifetime is a petal in a flower; the soul is the flower. I sometimes meditate on a flower and imagine each hundred-year lifetime as a pistil, a stamen, a petal in this magnificent flower. To be a genius at life—to be completely unfolded and take advantage of the opportunity we’ve been given to grow and become more than we’ve been.",

This is important: as you go deeper into the universe, every deeper level of reality functions at a higher level of energy. This is recognized in the deep mystical traditions. A deeper level of consciousness is a higher level of energy, and if you are going to have stable experience there, you must stabilize your consciousness at that higher energy. Mountain climbers adapt to less oxygen as they ascend; likewise, in deep non-ordinary states you must accommodate greater and greater energy, learning to manage it.

This comes at the very end of \"The Living Classroom.\" The book was published in 2008, written in 2006–2007, and I stopped the heavy-duty psychedelic work in '99. Over time, this energetic resonance calmed down; it didn't go away entirely, but instead of being like a lightning rod, where things happened around me without my effort, I had to cooperate with it—I had to let it happen. Not that I could control it, but there was a sense that it was subtler. That teaches us something about the etheric level: the practice empowers the system, you open up, you bring in heavy-duty energy, you move from 110 volts to 240 volts—naturally, you activate these inherent circuits. But then if things calm down, it’s not like the circuits go away—the network is there, but there’s less energy driving it. There's wisdom in the pace of evolution. There is a certain—not a risk, exactly, but if you drive the system hard, things happen; then you calm down and things settle. So I don’t have that transparency today that I did at the peak described in \"The Living Classroom.\" Now it’s much subtler than it was then.",

These practices build the capacity to enter very profound states of consciousness. If you enter these deeper states rapidly—as can happen with psychedelics—very powerful purification processes are triggered: physical, emotional, and mental detoxification. It’s a tremendous catharsis, described in subtle energy terms.

The scenario that unfolded was that the collective psyche will move into such a highly energized state that it will begin to operate as a non-linear, far-from-equilibrium system. We know something about how physical systems operate in non-linear conditions: they are capable of accelerated change; small perturbations produce expanded outcomes; creativity emerges from within the system in unprecedented ways; hydrogen and oxygen combine to produce water. Things happen that are unanticipated within a linear framework.",

We generate energy by making choices, and the universe responds to this energy.” That’s what you were describing with the lake. “We are always creating our own experience,” and, “We control the flow of energy out from and back into our lives. What comes to us from without originates from within. The more one moves toward one’s center and engages the deeper levels of one’s conditioning, the more one becomes conscious of being the source of one’s experience.” I suppose that insight continues to evolve with you. It’s a powerful synthesis of the human journey whether you do psychedelics or not, because it’s true in day-to-day consciousness.

I describe these in the book, but basically I understood enough about chronic energy and Ayurvedic medicine to understand what was happening, and I was just running too much energy.

In that condition—like water as you keep increasing the energy going into it, or a bathtub as you keep increasing the quantity of water and the ripples start to change—we come to a tipping point, a bifurcation point, where the system has too much energy to maintain its current structures. It flips into a different organizational pattern. It chooses a different future. When physical systems reach non-equilibrium points, they can do extraordinary things: produce new particles, create orders of coherence within themselves that would have been impossible at a lower energy state.",

When you go into these states, you open into vast fields of consciousness, and the energy is just immense—it runs through your system. You have to prepare your body to go into those states, and after the session, you have to help it absorb the experience in a healthy manner. You have to stay clean—in your habits, in your meditation, your yoga, structural aspects of your body. I discovered that my system had a natural capacity to let go, and I never had trouble coming back—there was a natural congealing. But you have to monitor your system carefully. I would have a session, write it up, then take two or three months to absorb it, ponder it, follow its teachings—because it gives you teachings. Then I would open up again, and the process would repeat itself.\n\nIain McNay:\nThere are also layers of conditioning you're letting go of—not by effort, but by allowance in the sessions, yes?",

I’m 70 now—if I haven’t learned by now… After I stopped the LSD work in ’99, I occasionally did light sessions, or psilocybin sessions, and a few ayahuasca sessions, or salvia divinorum. I broadened my experience with those substances. But the LSD work was in a category unto itself.\n\nOne thing I found was that my body, my system, was storing energy over time. Doing multiple sessions, my system stored energy and used it periodically to trigger breakthroughs into new levels of consciousness.

All of our spiritual practice, all of our actions, radiate and touch the consciousness of the beings around us. Knowing this, we take more responsibility for sending a positive, beneficial experience into the world. We are never isolated from those around us. It may be invisible or subtle, but it’s always there. The more we act on that basis, the more we activate the sinews that bind us to life. This is true not just for human beings—it’s true for all life forms that surround us.

Why was all that physical and energetic purification necessary?\nChris Bache\nThere are many levels of answers, but basically, if we want deeper intimacy with the consciousness of the universe, we’re moving into states that are vast and operate at a much higher frequency and energy level. Our egoic consciousness—the ordinary consciousness organized around our bodily existence—is too small. We have to let go of that consciousness. Some people find that easier or more difficult, but letting go at the egoic level and entering into spiritual reality is the first of many cycles of death and rebirth, because the universe has many levels and dimensions. To enter each successive deeper level, we have to go through a deeper surrender, and that often involves intense purification and confrontation.\n\nEvery step deeper into the universe is a step into a higher bandwidth of energy. We have to literally become a being who can live at that level—be operational at that level—for hours at a time. That takes work. It takes a lot of work.",

One of the things that was shown to me along the way—when you talked about fields and quantum fields—was that the intensity of the global crisis we're entering is going to hyper-stimulate not only our individual fields but the collective field of humanity. It will drive us into non-linear conditions. We know something about how physical fields behave in non-linear conditions—chaos theory. If we assume the psychic field of humanity under non-linear, far-from-equilibrium conditions will have some of those same qualities, then we have a way of seeing emergence from the depths of the human psyche: the emergence of new forms, crystallizations that weren’t available previously but actualize latent capacities within human nature. That feels deeply aligned with what you’re talking about, and it helps us understand how we can make as big a change as we need to in as short a time as we have. When we come to trigger points—bifurcations—systems are very susceptible to small perturbations, so the influence of individuals increases the more we move into a period of crisis. That gives added weight to each of our effects on the outcome. I really support what you’re saying.",

During this cooling off period, I began to notice that the synchronicities with my students that I described in *The Living Classroom* were happening less frequently, underscoring the role that sheer energy plays in accessing these ever-present fields of information. During the peak years, I had sometimes felt like a lightning rod, triggering insights and openings around me over which I had little control. Now I found that I had to cooperate with this process for these connections to manifest. The lightning still strikes and arrows still hit unseen targets, but today it has become a subtler dance.",

In my experience, each step deeper into our multidimensional universe is a step into a more intense field of energy. *Deeper* states of consciousness are *higher* states of energy. This is an unmistakable sensation and a widely recognized principle in spiritual traditions. One may have glancing contact with deep levels of reality without this becoming apparent, but to have *stable experience* of a given level of reality, one must acclimate to its energy. Just as when climbing a mountain we must acclimate to the atmospheric conditions of higher elevations, here we must acclimate to the energetic conditions of deeper levels of reality. In mountain climbing, we are adjusting to less oxygen; in psychedelic work, we are adjusting to more energy, and this activates intense purification processes.",

Like an athlete undertaking a strenuous sport, we have to train for the event. Not only do our minds have to adjust to the expanded capacities LSD awakens, so do our bodies. Our subtle energy system has to be conditioned and strengthened to sustain the enormous flows of energy evoked by the LSD state. As I look back on these early sessions, they seem to have functioned as an intensive training camp, preparing me physically and psychologically for the long journey that was beginning. They also broke me down existentially, taking me into my first death and rebirth.",

Our habitual conditioning is interrupted and our field of awareness is dramatically expanded, but after a number of hours our consciousness returns to its familiar patterns. If we don’t take steps to accurately record our experiences as soon as we return, our memory of them tends to fade. What was overwhelmingly powerful one day becomes slightly dimmer the next and dimmer still a month later. Preserving the memory of our experiences as carefully as possible completes the circle of learning and lays a stronger foundation for our next session.",

My sessions were so intense that eventually my system was having difficulty managing all this “extra” energy. In deep psychedelic sessions, you open yourself to enormous tidal waves of energy. They carry you into vast energetic landscapes that are fascinating to experience, but after the session ends it can leave your subtle energy system feeling stretched and achy. This short-term effect usually fades within a few days, but the longer and the more deeply you work with psychedelics, the more significant this trickle effect becomes. What do you do with all this energy that is continuously flowing into you inbetween your sessions, that pulses in your heart and beams from your skull? Now that you are no longer in the visionary state and your system has shrunk back to its “normal” shape and size, how do you integrate the new energetic being you are slowly becoming?",

They are beginning to live in me differently than before and I in them. It feels like my session memories have come together to form a greater living whole and that the inside and outside of my life are moving toward a new synthesis. There is a saying from the Navajo: “When you put a thing in order, and give it aname, and you are all in accord, it becomes.” By telling my story, by giving it aname and owning my experience, something new has been set in motion. A new peace has settled over me. At first this peace eased my existential loneliness and made the loss of communion more bearable, but then it deepened further. As I was finishing the book and beginning to speak about it publicly, a new spiritual transparency began to open in my life. It sometimes feels as though the Beloved is not waiting for me to die but is coming for me here. Where this will lead, I don’t know. It is still unfolding, taking me to new places, but surely this is the work of integration—to own, internalize, and manifest your experiences as deeply as you can. To let them flow through you and shape your presence on this Earth.",

In my experience, each step deeper into our multidimensional universe is a step into a more intense field of energy. *Deeper* states of consciousness are *higher* states of energy. This is an unmistakable sensation and a widely recognized principle in spiritual traditions. One may have glancing contact with deep levels of reality without this becoming apparent, but to have *stable experience* of a given level of reality, one must acclimate to its energy. Just as when climbing a mountain we must acclimate to the atmospheric conditions of higher elevations, here we must acclimate to the energetic conditions of deeper levels of reality. In mountain climbing, we are adjusting to less oxygen; in psychedelic work, we are adjusting to more energy, and this activates intense purification processes.",

LSD does not blast you through the many layers of the cosmos as quickly as 5-MeO-DMT does, but the eight-hour LSD interface invites/propels/forces a polishing of the consciousness doing the exploring as it is impacted/ instructed/healed by the consciousness being explored. An LSD session grinds slow but it grinds fine. It gives us time to be engaged and changed by the realities we are encountering. I think this polishing influences both the eventual clarity of our perception in these states and what we are able to bring back from them, both in terms of healing and understanding.",

It radically expanded not only the *depth of consciousness* reached but also the *breadth of consciousness* being activated in each session. It wasn’t simply a matter of eating the same karmic meal in fewer bites, as I had naively thought. Because the web of life is an integrated whole from the very start, working with high doses of LSD activates wider portions of this web. Working at these levels changed not only how deep my experiences went but also who or what was actually having these experiences, what the “working unit” of experience was in a session. In these highly energized conditions, the size of the patient literally expands. What I mean by this will become clearer as we proceed.",

        "text": "This interpretation proposes that the working of the collective psyche parallels the working of the personal psyche in key respects. It proposes that just as painful experiences can accumulate and block the healthy functioning of the individual, similar blockages can occur at the collective level. It suggests that the unresolved anguish of human history might still be active in the collective memory of our species, burdening its life just as our personal unresolved anguish burdens ours. Continuing the parallel, if the conscious engagement of unresolved pain can bring therapeutic relief at the personal level, the same may also occur at the species level. Normally, we would expect such healing to take the form of reform movements or cultural shifts in which large numbers of people confront and heal some painful legacy from our past. Within the context of LSD therapy, however, a new possibility seems to be emerging. In this setting, an individual seems to be able to tap into and directly facilitate a healing of some portion of the collective psyche. The process of engaging and healing a collective META-COEX system in a psychedelic session is essentially the same as engaging and healing a personal COEX system, but enacted on a much larger scale and a different level of consciousness. Grof has embraced this expansion of his paradigm.",

I had watched as each session began more or less where the previous session had stopped, so I knew that they were tightly interwoven thematically, but I had assumed that each session stood on its own feet energetically, that the energetic output of each session was separate and independent. Now I began to realize that there was an energetic momentum building across the sessions. My system was somehow storing energy activated in multiple sessions and then using that stored energy to generate these massive periodic breakthroughs. This was a sobering discovery as it changed my calculation of the true cost of each breakthrough.

We show up, do the work, and make our requests, but in this collaboration a larger intelligence sets the course. What we experience seems to be a combination of what the universe wants us to know and what we are capable of knowing. If we drop into this ocean too quickly, we will lose our bearings and won't be able to bring back much of value. But if we use these hours conscientiously, this intelligence will take us in and teach us. Here all instruction is by initiation. We learn by becoming.

Eventually, however, these fragments are healed and the threads are rewound. As this happens, we become more internally coherent, and our physical existence begins to become more transparent to choices originating in our Soul and the deeper fields that our Soul is part of.

At still deeper levels, such portals may allow any number of transcendental blessings to be infused directly into lower orders of existence.

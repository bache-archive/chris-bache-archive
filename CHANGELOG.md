## v3.4.1 — 2025-10-23  
**Repository Cleanup & Rights-Clean Preservation**

This release finalizes the long-term archival structure of the **Chris Bache Archive**, ensuring it remains fully public-domain and legally unambiguous.

### Key Changes
- 🧹 **Removed all non–CC0 materials**
  - Deleted `docs/educational/`, `reports/quote_packs/`, and `backups/sources_json/` directories.
  - Removed legacy scripts that supported educational-page generation.
  - Confirmed all remaining materials are verifiably CC0 and rights-safe.
- 🧾 **Updated documentation**
  - Rewrote `README.md` to clearly describe current scope — transcripts, captions, diarist files, and retrieval tools.
  - Simplified repository purpose and structure overview.
- 🧩 **Cleaned and hardened repo**
  - Regenerated `sitemap.xml` and section sitemaps for transcripts, captions, and diarist text.
  - Updated `.gitignore` to prevent reintroduction of removed directories.
  - Confirmed fixity and verified all checksums.
- 🔗 **Cross-link separation**
  - The educational and book-quoting materials now reside in a new public repository:
    - [https://github.com/bache-archive/bache-educational-docs](https://github.com/bache-archive/bache-educational-docs)

### Summary
This version marks a **clean archival baseline** — a public-domain corpus consisting only of verified transcripts, captions, diarist text, and vector indices.  
All educational or interpretive materials now live independently under a separate project.

---

## v3.3.2 — 2025-10-22  
**Sitemap Consolidation & Generator Update**

This maintenance release unified the sitemap system for GitHub Pages publishing.

  - Deterministic URL sorting and whitespace-safe `<loc>` output.
  - Adds `<lastmod>` and `<changefreq>` fields for transcript, caption, and diarist pages.
  - Skips archived or non-served paths to prevent 404s.
- ✅ Regenerated `sitemap.xml` to reflect all current transcript and caption pages (2014–2025).

### Summary
Streamlines site indexing for search engines and guarantees that only valid, publicly served resources are listed in the archive’s sitemap.

---

## v3.3 — 2025-10-22

---

## v3.1.5 — 2025-10-21  
**Rights-Clean, Normalized, and Re-Embedded Corpus**

Finalized the v3.1 series with a verified, rights-compliant dataset and refreshed retrieval indices.

### Highlights

---

## v3.1 — 2025-10-15
**Citation & URL Enrichment**

This release enhances the **Bache Talks RAG** system with human-readable citations and canonical URLs, improving both interpretability and scholarly referencing.

**Changes**
- Added `rag/citation_labels.json` (maps transcript paths → readable “Bache · date · venue · title” strings).  
- Extended `tools/embed_and_faiss.py` to:
  - Load citation labels and enrich all chunk metadata.  
  - Backfill canonical URLs from `index.json` (`web_url`, `youtube_url`, `media.*`).  
  - Embed enriched rows and rebuild FAISS index with stable numeric IDs.  
  - Emit extended QC report (`reports/embedding_qc.json`) showing sample enriched rows.
- Updated retriever and answer pipelines to display these human-readable citations in results.

**Verification**
- 2,561 chunks re-embedded → 3,072-dim vectors.
- Parquet and FAISS counts matched (`len(df) == idx.ntotal`).
- Retriever functional: citation strings and URLs returned as expected.

**Significance**
- Greatly improves user-facing output of both `/search` and `/answer` endpoints.  
- Establishes a consistent metadata bridge between the RAG layer and the archive index for future timecode mapping and web integration.

---

## v3.0.1 — 2025-10-15
**Maintenance · Provenance Alignment · Clean Public Tree**

- Pruned one legacy item from public sources (transcript, diarist, HTML) and rebuilt site assets (`sitemap.xml` + HTML).

- Regenerated sitemaps; verified no public references remain.
- Updated `checksums/FIXITY_LOG.md` with a v3.0.1 baseline entry.
- No new features; routine archival housekeeping and metadata alignment.

## v3.0-alpha.1 — 2025-10-14  
**Live RAG Deployment · API Integration · Evaluation**

This release advances the Bache Talks RAG from a local proof-of-concept to a **live, citation-grounded semantic service** hosted on Render, complete with Custom GPT integration and verified evaluation.

**New components**
- **API Backend:**  
  Added standalone repo [`bache-rag-api`](https://github.com/bache-archive/bache-rag-api) implementing a FastAPI service with `/search`, `/answer`, `/openapi.json`, `/_debug`, and `/_rag_status` endpoints.
- **Hosting:**  
  Deployed successfully on Render (free tier) — confirmed 2,817 vectors × 3,072 dimensions loaded, metadata verified, OpenAI key active.
- **Custom GPT Integration:**  
  Created *Bache Talks Librarian* using the live OpenAPI schema; fully functional and limited to RAG-only retrieval.
- **Documentation:**  
  Added `README_RAG.md`, `CONFIG.md`, and updated `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect live deployment.  
  Evaluation log committed at `reports/2025-10-15_gpt-eval_bache-talks.md`.

**Verification**
- `/search` and `/answer` endpoints respond under 1.5 s with correct multi-talk citations.  
- Evaluation score: ★★★★☆ (4.5 / 5) — verified cross-year synthesis and factual grounding.  
- Confirmed configuration:  

EMBED_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
EMBED_DIM=3072
MAX_PER_TALK=2
FAISS_INDEX_PATH=vectors/bache-talks.index.faiss
METADATA_PATH=vectors/bache-talks.embeddings.parquet

- Retrieval capped at ≤2 chunks per talk for citation diversity.

**Significance**
- Establishes the first **live, verifiable semantic interface** for the Bache Talks corpus.  
- Completes transition from static archive → dynamic knowledge system.  
- Forms the operational base for v3.x longitudinal evaluation and stylistic refinement.

**Next**
- Implement citation-range compression (e.g., “chunks 12–15”).  
- Add stylistic polish pass and evaluation automation.
- Prepare v3.1 release with improved synthesis formatting and dashboard metrics.

## v2.4 — 2025-10-01
**Transcript Rebuilds from Diarists · Repo Unification · Clean Index**

This release provides version 2.4 of the Chris Bache Archive, a curated collection of transcripts, diarist files, captions, and metadata covering Chris Bache’s talks, interviews, and lectures (2014–2025).

**Key updates in v2.4**
- **Transcripts rebuilt from diarists:** All 68 transcripts regenerated from diarized sources, significantly improving speaker attribution. Earlier versions relied on captions + GPT inference, which sometimes mis-labeled speakers. (Minor residual errors may remain.)

- **Captions included:** Where available, original YouTube captions remain in `sources/captions/` for comparison.
- **Diarists preserved:** Raw diarized text files are included for transparency and future reprocessing.

**Notes**
- This bundle **excludes media** (audio/video). Media are preserved via dedicated Internet Archive collections and Zenodo deposit.
- License: **CC0 1.0 Universal** (public domain dedication).

## General Notes for v2.4
- No full human editorial review has yet been conducted.  
- All 63 readable transcripts were generated automatically by GPT-5 from Otter.ai diarized sources.  
- Minor automatic corrections (punctuation, filler-word removal) occurred as part of the GPT-5 cleaning process.  
- The front-matter field `model: gpt-o3` appears in many files in error.  →  **To be corrected to `model: gpt-5` in v2.5.**
